## ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SOLANIO enter.
###ANTONIO
To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad. I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too. But I have no idea how I got so depressed. And if I can’t figure out what’s making me depressed, I must not understand myself very well. 
###SALARINO
You’re worried about your ships. Your mind is out there getting tossed around on the ocean with them. But they’re fine. They’re like huge parade floats on the sea. They’re so big they look down on the smaller ships, which all have to bow and then get out of the way. Your ships fly like birds past those little boats. 
###SOLANIO
Yes, believe me, if I had such risky business ventures in other countries, I’d be sad too. I’d worry about it every second. I’d constantly be tossing blades of grass into the air to find out which way the wind was blowing. I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways. Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad. 
###SALARINO
I’d get scared every time I blew on my soup to cool it, thinking of how a strong wind could wipe out my ships. Every time I glanced at the sand in an hourglass I’d imagine my ships wrecked on sandbars. I’d think of dangerous rocks every time I went to church and saw the stones it was made of. If my ship brushed up against rocks like that, its whole cargo of spices would be dumped into the sea. All of its silk shipments would be sent flying into the roaring waters. In one moment I’d go bankrupt. Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that? It’s obvious. Antonio is sad because he’s so worried about his cargo. 
###ANTONIO
No, that’s not it, trust me. Thankfully my financial situation is healthy. I don’t have all of my money invested in one ship, or one part of the world. If I don’t do well this year, I’ll still be okay. So it’s not my business that’s making me sad. 
###SOLANIO
Well then, you must be in love. 
###ANTONIO
Oh, give me a break. 
###SOLANIO
You’re not in love either? Fine, let’s just say you’re sad because you’re not in a good mood. You know, it’d be just as easy for you to laugh and dance around and say you’re in a good mood. You could just say you’re not sad. Humans are so different. 
Some people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny. 
## BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO enter.
Here comes your cousin Bassanio. And Gratiano and Lorenzo too. Goodbye, then. We’ll leave you to talk to them. They’re better company. 
###SALARINO
I would’ve stayed to cheer you up, if your nobler friends hadn’t shown up. 
###ANTONIO
You’re both very precious to me. But I understand. You need to leave to take care of your own business. 
###SALARINO
(to BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO) Good morning, gentlemen. 
###BASSANIO
(to SALARINO and SOLANIO) Hello, friends. When are we going to have fun together again? Just name the time. We never see you anymore. Does it have to be that way? 
###SALARINO
Let us know when you want to get together. We’re available. 
## SALARINO and SOLANIO exit.
###LORENZO
Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio. But don’t forget, we’re meeting for dinner tonight. 
###BASSANIO
Don’t worry, I’ll be there. 
###GRATIANO
You don’t look well, Antonio. You’re taking things too seriously. People with too much invested in the world always get hurt. I’m telling you, you don’t look like yourself. 
###ANTONIO
For me the world is just the world, Gratiano—a stage where every person has a part to play. I play a sad one. 
###GRATIANO
Then I’ll play the happy fool and get laugh lines on my face. I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun. Why should any living man sit still like a statue? Why should he sleep when he’s awake? Why should he get ulcers from being crabby all the time? I love you, and I’m telling you this because I care about you, Antonio—there are men who always look serious. Their faces never move or show any expression, like stagnant ponds covered with scum. They’re silent and stern, and they think they’re wise and deep, important and respectable. When they talk, they think everybody else should keep quiet, and that even dogs should stop barking. I know a lot of men like that, Antonio. The only reason they’re considered wise is because they don’t say anything. I’m sure if they ever opened their mouths, everyone would see what fools they are. I’ll talk to you more about this some other time. In the meantime, cheer up. Don’t go around looking so glum. That’s my opinion, but what do I know? I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now. I’ll finish my lecture after dinner. 
###LORENZO
All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime. I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word in. 
###GRATIANO
If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own voice. I won’t ever let you speak. 
###ANTONIO
Goodbye. After that lecture of yours, I’ll start talking a lot. 
###GRATIANO
Thank you. The only tongues that should be silent are ox-tongues on a dinner plate and those that belong to old maids. 
## GRATIANO and LORENZO exit.
###ANTONIO
Is he right? 
###BASSANIO
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice. His point is always like a needle in a haystack—you look for it all day, and when you find it you realize it wasn’t worth the trouble. 
###ANTONIO
So, who’s this girl, the one you said you were going to take a special trip for? You promised to tell me. 
###BASSANIO
Antonio, you know how bad my finances have been lately. I’ve been living way beyond my means. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining about having to cut back. 
I just want to be honorable and pay off the big debts that piled up when I was living the high life. I’m in debt to many people, and I owe most to you, Antonio—both money and gratitude. And because you care about me, I know you’ll let me tell you my plan to clear all my debts. 
###ANTONIO
Please let me know your plan, Bassanio. As long as it’s honorable, you can be sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you. 
###BASSANIO
Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first. By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back. I’m telling you this story for a reason. I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve lost what I owe you. But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time. Either we’ll get back all the money I owe you, or else we’ll get back what you lend me this time, and I’ll just owe you what I already owe you. 
###ANTONIO
You know me better than that. You’re wasting your breath. All of this talk means you have doubts about my friendship. That’s worse than if you bankrupted me. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. Tell me. 
###BASSANIO
There’s a girl in Belmont who’s inherited a huge amount of money, and she’s beautiful and—even better—she’s a good person. I think she likes me. Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me. Her name is Portia. She’s as rich as that famous Roman heroine Portia, the daughter of Cato and wife of Brutus. Her wealth is world-famous. Famous and important men have come in from all over the world to try to marry her. The hair that hangs down on her forehead is like gold, calling every adventurer to Belmont like a gold rush. Antonio, if I only had enough money to hold my own against those suitors, I know I could win her! 
###ANTONIO
You know right now all my money’s tied up in that cargo that’s still at sea. I can’t give you the cash you need because I don’t have it. But go ahead and charge things to me on credit, as much credit as I can get in Venice. I’ll use all my lines of credit to help you get to Belmont, to Portia. Go see who will lend money, and I’ll do the same. I’m sure I can get something either as a business loan, or as a personal favor. 
##They exit.
## PORTIA and NERISSA enter.
###PORTIA
Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world. 
###NERISSA
You’d be tired, madam, if you had bad luck rather than wealth and good luck. But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing. The best way to be happy is to be in between. When you have too much you get old sooner, but having just enough helps you live longer. 
###PORTIA
Good point, and well said. 
###NERISSA
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life. 
###PORTIA
You think it’s that easy? If doing good deeds were as easy as knowing how to do them, then everyone would be better off. Small chapels would be big churches, and poor men’s cottages would be princes' palaces. It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches. For me, it’s easier to lecture twenty people on how to be good than to be the one person out of twenty who actually does good things. The brain can tell the heart what to do, but what does it matter? Cold rules don’t matter when you’ve got a hot temper. Young people are like frisky young rabbits, and good advice is like a crippled old man trying to catch them. But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband. Oh, the word “choose” is strange! I can’t choose who I like, or refuse who I dislike. I’m a living daughter still controlled by the wishes of her dead father. Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa? 
###NERISSA
Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds. Your father’s idea was to have a game with three boxes. The suitor who can figure out whether to pick the gold, silver, or lead box will solve your father’s riddle—and that suitor’s the man for you. No one will ever choose the right box who doesn’t deserve your love. But tell me. Do you like any of the princely suitors who’ve come? 
###PORTIA
Run through the list. As you name them I’ll describe them for you, and from my descriptions you can guess how I feel toward them. 
###NERISSA
Well, first there was the prince from Naples. 
###PORTIA
Ah, yes, that stallion. All he talks about is his horse. He thinks it’s a great credit to his character that he can shoe a horse all by himself. I’m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith. 
###NERISSA
Then there’s the Count Palatine. 
###PORTIA
He does nothing but frown, as if he wants to say, “If you don’t want me, I don’t care.” He doesn’t even smile when he hears funny stories. If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young, I can only imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man. No, I’d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men. God protect me from these two! 
###NERISSA
What did you think about that French lord, Monsieur le Bon? 
###PORTIA
We might as well call him a man, since God created him. No, I know it’s bad to make fun of people, but still! His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine. He was trying to outdo everyone so much that you couldn’t tell who he was. He started dancing every time a bird sang, and he was so eager to show off his fencing that he’d fight with his own shadow. If I married him, I might as well as marry twenty husbands, because he’s like twenty men all rolled into one! I’d understand it if he hated me, since even if he loved me desperately, I’d never be able to love him back. 
###NERISSA
What about Falconbridge, that young English baron? 
###PORTIA
I have no opinion about him. We don’t talk because we don’t understand each other. He doesn’t speak Latin, French, or Italian, and you know how little English I speak. He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language? He was dressed so oddly too! I think he got his jacket in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere. 
###NERISSA
What do you think of his neighbor, the Scottish lord? 
###PORTIA
I think he’s very forgiving, since he let the Englishman slap him on the ear without hitting him back. Rather than defend himself, he just threatened to pay the Englishman back later. Then the Frenchman promised to help the Scot pay the Englishman back, and added a slap of his own. 
###NERISSA
How did you like the young German, the duke of Saxony’s nephew? 
###PORTIA
He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk. At his best he’s a little less than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal. If we got married and he tragically met his demise, I’m sure I could find a way to go on without him. 
###NERISSA
If he offers to play the game and chooses the right box, but then you reject him, you’ll be disobeying your father’s last wishes. 
###PORTIA
I know. So please put a nice big glass of white wine on the wrong box. I know he’ll get tempted and choose that one. I’ll do anything rather than marry a drunk, Nerissa. 
###NERISSA
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady. They’ve all told me what they want, which is to go back home and give up on you—unless there was some other way to win you than your father’s pick-the-box test. 
###PORTIA
I’ll die an old maid unless I can be won according to the rules set by my father’s will. I’m glad these suitors are sensible enough to stay away. The only thing I like about them is that they’re not there. I wish them all safe trips home. 
###NERISSA
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive? 
###PORTIA
Yes, yes, that was Bassanio. I think that was his name. 
###NERISSA
Yes, madam, that’s the one. He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen. 
###PORTIA
I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise. 
##A SERVANT enters.
Hello, do you have any news? 
###SERVANT
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam. And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight. 
###PORTIA
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming. If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me. Let’s go, Nerissa.—(to the SERVANT) Go ahead. As soon as we shut the door on one suitor, another one starts knocking. 
##They exit.
## BASSANIO and SHYLOCK enter.
###SHYLOCK
Three thousand ducats, hmmm. 
###BASSANIO
Yes, for three months. 
###SHYLOCK
For three months, hmmm. 
###BASSANIO
As I said before, Antonio will guarantee the loan. If I default, he’ll pay you. 
###SHYLOCK
Antonio will guarantee it, hmmm. 
###BASSANIO
Can you help me? What’s your answer? 
###SHYLOCK
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it. 
###BASSANIO
Your answer? 
###SHYLOCK
Antonio’s a good man. 
###BASSANIO
Have you heard anything to the contrary? 
###SHYLOCK
What? No, no, no, no. What I meant in saying he’s a good man is that he has enough money to guarantee the loan. But his investments are uncertain right now. He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies. What’s more, people at the Rialto tell me he has a third ship in Mexico, and a fourth in England, as well as other business ventures throughout the world. 
But ships are just fragile boards, and sailors are just men. There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks. Anything could happen. But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough. Three thousand ducats—I think I can let him guarantee your loan. 
###BASSANIO
I assure you he can. 
### SHYLOCK
I will be sure he can, before I make the loan. And I’ll think of a way to be sure. Can I speak with Antonio? 
###BASSANIO
If you like, you can dine with us. 
Oh yes—to smell pork ? I don’t think so!. Your prophet Jesus sent the devil into a herd of pigs. I’m not going to eat that. I’ll buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so on, but I won’t eat with you, drink with you, or pray with you. Any news on the Rialto? Who’s that? 
## ANTONIO enters.
###BASSANIO
This is Signor Antonio. 
###SHYLOCK
(to himself) He looks just like a guy who’s robbed me but now comes to beg me for a favor! I hate him because he’s a Christian. But more than that, I hate him because he stupidly lends money without interest, which lowers the interest rates here in Venice. If I can just get the upper hand of him once, I’ll satisfy my old grudge against him. He hates Jews. Even at the Rialto he’s always complaining about me and my negotiating and my hard-earned profits, which he calls “interest.” 
It would an insult to Jews everywhere to forgive that man! 
###BASSANIO
Shylock, are you listening? 
###SHYLOCK
I’m thinking about how much cash I have on hand. If I remember correctly, I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately. But so what? Tubal, a wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash. But wait a minute! How many months do you want? (to ANTONIO) Oh, hello, how are you, signor? We were just talking about you. 
###ANTONIO
Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need. (to BASSANIO) Does he know how much you need? 
###SHYLOCK
Oh yes, three thousand ducats. 
###ANTONIO
For three months. 
###SHYLOCK
Yes, I forgot—three months. (to BASSANIO) You told me that. (to ANTONIO) Now then, about your guarantee. Let me see—but listen, Antonio, I thought you said you don’t lend or borrow with interest. 
###ANTONIO
That’s right. That’s not how I do business. 
###SHYLOCK
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep—Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright, because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir— 
###ANTONIO
What’s your point? Did he charge interest? 
###SHYLOCK
No, he didn’t charge interest—not in your sense of the word. But listen to what Jacob did. When he and Laban agreed that all the spotted lambs would be Jacob’s pay, it was the end of autumn, when the sheep were starting to mate. Because newborns look like whatever their mother sees during mating, he stuck some spotted branches into the ground right in front of the sheep, who saw them while they mated. The mothers later gave birth to spotted lambs, all of which went to Jacob. That was his way of expanding his business, and it worked. My point is that profit is a blessing, as long as you don’t steal to get it. 
###ANTONIO
That business venture you’re referring to happened because God made it happen like that. Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened. Are you saying this story proves that charging interest makes sense? That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep? 
###SHYLOCK
I can hardly tell the difference; I make my money multiply as fast as those sheep. But listen to me, signor— 
###ANTONIO
Watch out, Bassanio. The devil can quote Scripture for his own use. An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you. He looks like a good apple but he’s rotten at the core. Oh, liars can look so honest! 
###SHYLOCK
Three thousand ducats. That’s a nice even sum. Three months from twelve months of the year. Let me see. The interest rate will be— 
###ANTONIO
Well, Shylock? Are you going to loan us the money? 
###SHYLOCK
Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto. I have always just shrugged and put up with it because Jews are good at suffering. You called me a heathen, a dirty dog, and you spit on my Jewish clothes. And all because I use my own money to make a profit. And now it looks like you need my help. All right then. You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door. And now you’re asking for money. What can I tell you? Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money? Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say: 
“Sir, last Wednesday you spit on me. You insulted me on this day, and another time you called me a dog. And out of gratitude for these favors, I’ll be happy to lend you the money?” 
###ANTONIO
I’ll probably call you those names again and spit on you, and reject you again too. If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends. When did friends charge interest? Instead, lend it to me as your enemy. If your enemy goes bankrupt, it’s easier for you to take your penalty from him. 
###SHYLOCK
Look at you getting all riled up! I want to be friends with you, and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me. I want to give you what you need, and not charge a penny of interest—but you won’t listen to me! I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing. 
###BASSANIO
That really would be kind. 
###SHYLOCK
I’ll show you how kind I am. Come with me to a notary and we’ll make it official. And let’s add a little clause just for a joke. If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like. 
###ANTONIO
It’s a deal. I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice. 
###BASSANIO
No, you can’t sign a contract like that for me! I’d rather go without the money. 
###ANTONIO
Don’t worry about it, man, I won’t have to pay any penalty. In two months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments. 
###SHYLOCK
Oh father Abraham, what kind of people are these Christians? Their own meanness teaches them to suspect other people!—Please tell me this. If he fails to repay me by the deadline, what would I get out of such a penalty? A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef. I’m just offering this as a favor to a friend. If he agrees, great. If not, goodbye. And I hope you won’t think badly of me. 
###ANTONIO
Yes, Shylock, I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms. 
###SHYLOCK
Then meet me right away at the notary’s. Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away. I need to check in at home first, because one of my careless servants is in charge right now. I’ll see you soon. 
###ANTONIO
Hurry up, my Jewish friend. 
## SHYLOCK exits.
He’s so kind you’d think the Jew is turning Christian. 
###BASSANIO
I don’t like it when a villain acts nice. 
###ANTONIO
Come on, there’s no reason to worry. My ships will come home a month before the money is due. 
##They exit.
##Trumpets play. The prince of MOROCCOMoor is a word for a person from North Africa. The word does not denote a particular skin color. Shakespeare’s stage direction describing Morocco as “tawny” suggests that he is dark-skinned but not black.MOROCCO , a brown-skinned man dressed in all white, enters, followed by three or four servants dressed in costumes like his. PORTIA, NERISSA, and their ATTENDANTS enter.
###MOROCCO
Don’t hold my skin color against me. I was born and raised in the sun, which is why I’m dark-skinned. But I’m as red-blooded as any man. Show me the best-looking person born in the freezing north, where the sun barely thaws the icicles. I’ll win your love by cutting myself to prove to you I have redder blood than he does. I’m telling you, madam, my skin color has made brave men fear me and Moroccan girls love me. I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen. 
###PORTIA
Being good-looking isn’t the only way to my heart, you know. I have other criteria for choosing a husband. Not that it matters, because the box test takes away my free choice anyway. But if my father hadn’t restricted me like this—forcing me to marry whoever wins his test—then you’d have had as good a chance to marry me as any of the suitors I’ve met so far, prince. 
###MOROCCO
Thank you for saying that. Show me the caskets and let me try my luck. I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth. I would act braver than the bravest man on earth. I would grab bear cubs from a ferocious mother bear, or tease a hungry lion—all of this in order to win your love, lady. But this is bad! If the hero Hercules and his servant Lychas rolled the dice, which would win? Not the greater hero. Just the one who happened to be luckier that time. And just as Hercules could be beaten by his servant, blind luck could make me lose this test and make someone worse than me win. If that happened, I’d die of sadness. 
###PORTIA
You have to take your chances. Either don’t choose at all, or swear beforehand that if you choose incorrectly you’ll never talk about marriage to any woman again. Think about it carefully. 
###MOROCCO
Fine, I swear I won’t ever get married if I choose incorrectly. Let me take my chances. 
###PORTIA
Let’s go to the temple first. You can take your chances after dinner. 
I’ll try my luck then. I’ll either be the luckiest or the unluckiest man alive. 
##Trumpets play.
##They exit.
## LAUNCELOT enters alone.
###LAUNCELOT
I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master. The devil’s on my shoulder, tempting me. He’s saying, “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,” “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or “Good Launcelot Gobbo”—“use your legs and run away.” But my conscience says, “No, Launcelot, calm down, don’t run away.” The devil’s urging me to leave. “Go away!” he says. “Run away! Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother. Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says. “Don’t go,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil. But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the devil incarnate, and my conscience is giving me a hard time by telling me to stay with the Jew. The devil’s advice is nicer. I’ll run, devil. Tell me to run, and I’ll run. 
##GOBBO enters with a basket.
###GOBBO
Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence? 
###LAUNCELOT
(to himself) Good heavens, it’s my father. He doesn’t recognize me because he’s half-blind—or more than half-blind, somewhere between half-blind and totally blind. I’ll play a little game with him. 
###GOBBO
Young man, excuse me, how do I get to the Jew’s? 
###LAUNCELOT
Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left. Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house. 
###GOBBO
Good heavens, those are difficult directions. Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there? 
###LAUNCELOT
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot? (speaking so no one else can hear) Watch out, I’m going to pull a good prank here.—Is that who you’re talking about? 
###GOBBO
He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor man’s son. His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time. 
###LAUNCELOT
Well, his father can be whatever he wants to be. We’re talking about young Master Launcelot. 
###GOBBO
Please don’t call him that, sir. He’s just Launcelot. 
###LAUNCELOT
But excuse me, ergo, old man, ergo, I’m asking you if you’re talking about young Master Launcelot. 
###GOBBO
Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir. 
###LAUNCELOT
Ergo , Master Launcelot. But please don’t talk about Master Launcelot, old man. The young gentleman, submitting to the fates, the three sisters who control destiny, and other branches of learning like that, is deceased. Or, to put it in plain language, he’s gone to heaven. 
###GOBBO
Oh, no. God forbid! The boy was going to support me in my old age! 
###LAUNCELOT
What am I, a cane? How could I support anyone? Don’t you recognize me, father? 
###GOBBO
Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir. But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead? 
###LAUNCELOT
You really don’t recognize me, father? 
###GOBBO
Sir, I’m half-blind. I don’t know you. 
###LAUNCELOT
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me. It takes a wise father to know his own child. Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing. The truth will come to light, and murder can’t be hidden long—a man’s son may hide, but truth will always come out. 
###GOBBO
Please stand up! I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy. 
###LAUNCELOT
Come on, quit fooling around. Give me your blessing. I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child. 
###GOBBO
I can’t believe you’re my son. 
###LAUNCELOT
I don’t know what to say to that, but the fact is I’m Launcelot, the Jew’s servant, and Margery, your wife, is my mother. 
###GOBBO
Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery. If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood. (feels the back of LAUNCELOT’s head) My Lord, what a bushy beard you have! You’ve got more hair on your chin than Dobbin my horse has in his tail. 
###LAUNCELOT
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward. I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him. 
###GOBBO
Lord, how you’ve changed! How are you and your master getting along? I’ve brought him a present. How are you? 
###LAUNCELOT
I’m all right. But I’ve decided to run away, and I can’t wait to get going. My master’s a total Jew. You’re giving him a present? Give him a noose to hang himself. He’s starving me to death. You can see my ribs so well you can count them. I’m glad you’ve come, father. Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio. He gives his servants beautiful new uniforms. 
If I can’t get a job with him, I’ll run away to the ends of the earth.—Oh look, this is lucky, here comes Master Bassanio now.—Let’s go talk to him, Father. If I work for the Jew any longer, you can just call me a Jew. 
## BASSANIO enters with LEONARDO and an attendant or two.
###BASSANIO
(to an attendant) All right, go ahead. But do everything quickly. Supper must be ready at five at the latest. Make sure these letters get delivered, get the uniforms made, and tell Gratiano to come visit me soon. 
##The attendant exits.
###LAUNCELOT
Go talk to him, father. 
###GOBBO
(to BASSANIO) God bless you, sir! 
###BASSANIO
Thank you. What do you want with me? 
###GOBBO
This is my son, sir. He’s a poor boy— 
###LAUNCELOT
Not a poor boy, but the rich Jew’s servant, who wants, as my father will explain— 
###GOBBO
He wants very much, sir, as one might say, to work for— 
###LAUNCELOT
To put it briefly, I work for the Jew, and I want, as my father will tell you— 
###GOBBO
He and his master aren’t exactly friends— 
###LAUNCELOT
To be brief, the truth is that the Jew has done me wrong, and that forces me to—as my father, an old man, will inform you— 
###GOBBO
I have a present I’d like to give you, sir. And I want to request that— 
###LAUNCELOT
To make a long story short, the request is about me, as this good old man will tell you. Even though I’m his son and I’m the one saying it, this old man is a poor man— 
###BASSANIO
One of you do the talking. What do you want? 
###LAUNCELOT
To work for you, sir. 
###GOBBO
That’s what we’re trying to say, sir. 
###BASSANIO
I know who you are. You can have what you want. I spoke with your master Shylock today, and he recommended you to me. If you want to leave a rich Jew to work for a poor gentleman, you’re welcome to. 
###LAUNCELOT
Do you know the old proverb “The grace of God is enough,” sir? It could be divided between you and my boss Shylock—you have “the grace of God,” and he has “enough.” 
###BASSANIO
Nicely put.—Go with your son, old man.—Say goodbye to your old master and find your way to my house. (to attendants) Give him a uniform that’s a little nicer than the others. Make sure it gets done. 
###LAUNCELOT
Father, go ahead. I can’t get a job, can I? I can’t talk well, no. (reading his own palm) If any man in Italy has a palm good enough to swear on a Bible with, it’s me. I’ve got very good luck! Here’s my life line. It shows a few wives—fifteen wives is nothing. Eleven widows and nine maids is a humble beginning for one man. It seems I’ll almost drown three times, and my life will be in danger when I’m caught in bed with another man’s wife! But these little lines are the escape routes I can take to get out of that one. If luck’s a lady, she’s good at this business. Father, let’s go. I’ll leave the Jew behind in the blink of an eye. 
## LAUNCELOT and GOBBO exit.
BASSANIO Please, Leonardo, think about this (he hands him a piece of paper). These things have been bought and are ready. Hurry back here. I’m having dinner tonight with someone I greatly respect. Go now. 
###LEONARDO
I’ll do my best. 
## GRATIANO enters.
###GRATIANO
(to LEONARDO) Where’s your master? 
###LEONARDO
He’s walking over there, sir. 
## LEONARDO exits.
###GRATIANO
Signor Bassanio! 
###BASSANIO
Gratiano! 
###GRATIANO
I have a favor to ask. 
###BASSANIO
Anything. 
###GRATIANO
Don’t say no. Let me go with you to Belmont. 
###BASSANIO
Well, if you have to go, you have to go. But listen to me, Gratiano. Sometimes you get a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude. These things look good on you, of course, and to people like you and me there’s nothing wrong with it. But in places where people don’t know you, your behavior might seem too wild. Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia. 
###GRATIANO
Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about. I’ll be solemn-looking, I’ll talk with respect, and I’ll only swear once in a while. I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more. While grace is being said, I’ll be modest and say “amen”—I’ll watch my manners as if I’m trying to please my grandma. If I don’t do all this, never trust me again. 
###BASSANIO
Well, we’ll see how you act. 
###GRATIANO
Okay, but tonight doesn’t count. You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight.   
###BASSANIO
No, it’d be a shame for you to act serious tonight. I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun. Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now. I’ve got some business to take care of. 
###GRATIANO
I have to join Lorenzo and the others, but we’ll visit you at supper time. 
##They exit.
## JESSICA and LAUNCELOT enter.
###JESSICA
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this. It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil. But goodbye. Here’s a ducat for you. You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master. Give him this letter. (gives LAUNCELOT a letter) Do it secretly. Goodbye. I don’t want my father to see me talking to you. 
###LAUNCELOT
Goodbye. My tears show you my feelings, my beautiful pagan, my sweet Jew! I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you. But goodbye. It’s not manly to cry. Goodbye. 
###JESSICA
Goodbye, Launcelot. 
## LAUNCELOT exits.
Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child! But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior. Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you. 
##She exits.
## GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SOLANIO enter.
###LORENZO
No, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my house, and come back in an hour. 
###GRATIANO
But we haven’t made any preparations. 
###SALARINO
We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers. 
###SOLANIO
The masquerade party might turn out terribly if we don’t manage things carefully. I think it’s better to call it off. 
###LORENZO
It’s only four o'clock now. We have two hours to get ready. 
## LAUNCELOT enters with a letter.
Launcelot, what’s going on? 
###LAUNCELOT
(he gives LORENZO the letter) If you don’t mind opening this letter, you can find out for yourself. 
###LORENZO
I recognize the handwriting. It’s beautiful handwriting. And the beautiful hand that wrote this letter is whiter than the paper it’s written on. 
###GRATIANO
I bet it’s a love letter! 
###LAUNCELOT
(to LORENZO) May I be excused, sir? 
###LORENZO
Where are you going? 
###LAUNCELOT
To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the Christian. 
###LORENZO
(he gives LAUNCELOT money) Hold on, take this. Tell Jessica I won’t fail her. Tell her in private.—Go, gentlemen, get ready for the masquerade tonight. I have someone who can be my torchbearer. 
## LAUNCELOT exits.
###SALARINO
All right, I’ll go get things ready. 
###SOLANIO
Me too. 
###LORENZO
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour. 
###SALARINO
It’s good we’re doing this. 
## SALARINO and SOLANIO exit.
###GRATIANO
Wasn’t that letter from Jessica? 
###LORENZO
I have to tell you everything. She’s told me how I can get her out of her father’s house. She’s also told me what gold and jewels she owns, and she’s described the page’s uniform she’s keeping to wear as a disguise. If her father ever goes to heaven, it’ll be because his daughter’s so good. She’ll never be punished with bad luck—unless it’s because her father is an unbelieving Jew. Come with me. (gives GRATIANO the letter) You can look this letter over as you go. Beautiful Jessica will be my torchbearer. 
##They exit.
## SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT enter
###SHYLOCK
Well, you’ll see it with your own eyes. You’ll see the difference between working for Shylock and working for Bassanio.—(calling for his daughter) Jessica!—You won’t eat like a pig like you used to do at my place.—Jessica!—And sleep, and snore, and wear your clothes out.—Jessica, I’m calling you! 
###LAUNCELOT
Jessica! 
###SHYLOCK
Who asked you to call her? I’m not asking you to call her. 
###LAUNCELOT
You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told. 
## JESSICA enters.
###JESSICA
Did you call me? Do you need something? 
###SHYLOCK
I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica. Here are my keys.—But why should I go? I wasn’t invited because they like me. They’re just flattering me. But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house. I don’t feel like going. Things aren’t going my way right now. I know because I dreamed of money bags last night. 
###LAUNCELOT
Please go, sir. My new master is expecting your approach. 
###SHYLOCK
And I’m expecting his reproach. 
###LAUNCELOT
And they’ve been plotting things together. I’m not saying you’ll get a masquerade party, but if you do, I predicted it. I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon. 
###SHYLOCK
What, there’s going to be a masquerade? Listen to me, Jessica, lock my doors up, and when you hear the drum and the nasty squealing of the flute, don’t climb up to the windows. Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces. Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows. Don’t let the noise of shallow fools enter my serious house. I swear, I’m in no mood to go out to dinner tonight, but I’ll go anyway.—Launcelot, go tell them I’ll come. 
###LAUNCELOT
I’ll go ahead of you, sir. (to JESSICA) Mistress, be on the lookout when you’re staring out the window. A Christian’s coming who’ll be worth a Jewess’s glance. 
## LAUNCELOT exits.
###SHYLOCK
What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm? 
###JESSICA
He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else. 
###SHYLOCK
The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a snail when he works. He sleeps all day like a cat. Bees that don’t work can’t stay in my hive, so I’m letting him go, handing him off so he can waste money for his new boss, the man who borrowed money from me. Anyway, Jessica, go inside. I might come back soon. Do as I told you. Shut the doors after you. As the saying goes, lock things up, and you’ll get to keep them. 
## He exits.
###JESSICA
Goodbye. If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll lose a daughter. 
##She exits.
## RATIANO and SALARINO enter, dressed for the masquerade ball.
###GRATIANO
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him. 
###SALARINO
He’s late. 
###GRATIANO
Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early. 
###SALARINO
Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever. 
###GRATIANO
That’s always true. Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down? Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time? We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it. It’s like when a ship sails out of the harbor with all its flags waving, gently pushed by the wind. When that ship returns, her timber is all weather-beaten and her sails are ragged. That same wind makes the ship thin and poor. 
###SALARINO
Here comes Lorenzo. We’ll talk about this later. 
## LORENZO enters.
###LORENZO
My dear friends, thanks for your patience. I had business that made me late. When you have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long. Come over here. My future father-in-law, the Jew, lives here.—Hey! Who’s in there? 
## JESSICA appears above, disguised as a boy.
###JESSICA
Who are you? Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice. 
###LORENZO
I’m Lorenzo, your love. 
###JESSICA
Lorenzo, that’s for sure, and I’m also sure you’re my love—who else do I love so much? And now who but you knows whether I’m yours? 
###LORENZO
As God is my witness, you know you’re mine. 
###JESSICA
Here, catch this box. It’ll be worth your while. I’m glad it’s nighttime and you can’t see me. I’m ashamed of my disguise. But love is blind, and lovers can’t see the silly things they do around each other. If they could, Cupid himself would be embarassed to see me dressed up as a boy. 
###LORENZO
Come down here. You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade. 
###JESSICA
What, I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing? The truth is, I’m behaving like a loose woman. The torchbearer is supposed to bring light and love, but I should be hidden away in the dark. 
###LORENZO
You’re hidden away, sweetheart, dressed up like a boy. Come on quickly. Time flies at night, and we’re late for Bassanio’s feast. 
###JESSICA
I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right away. 
## JESSICA exits from above.
###GRATIANO
My God, she can’t be a Jew, she’s too nice! 
###LORENZO
God, I’m crazy about her. She’s wise, if I’m judging her right. She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see. And she’s loyal, as she has proven. And as long as she’s herself—wise, beautiful, and faithful—she’ll always have a place in my heart. 
## JESSICA enters.
Ah, you’re here?—Come on, gentlemen, let’s go! Our masquerade mates are waiting for us. 
## LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALARINO exit.
## ANTONIO enters.
###ANTONIO
Who’s there? 
###GRATIANO
Signor Antonio? 
###ANTONIO
Gratiano, where is everybody? It’s nine o'clock! Our friends are all waiting for you. There’s no masquerade tonight. The wind is blowing right, so Bassanio’s going onboard immediately. I’ve sent twenty people to look for you. 
###GRATIANO
I’m glad. I want to head out tonight. 
##They exit.
##Trumpets play. PORTIA enters with the prince of MOROCCO and both their entourages.
###PORTIA
(to servant) Go open the curtains and show the different boxes to the prince. 
A curtain is drawn revealing showing three caskets: one gold, one silver, and one lead. 
(to MOROCCO) Now make your choice. 
###MOROCCO
The first one, the gold one, has an inscription that says, “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” The second one, the silver one, says, “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” And this third one is made of dull lead. It has a blunt warning that says, “He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” How will I know if I chose the right one? 
###PORTIA
One of them contains my picture. If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with the picture. 
###MOROCCO
I wish some god could help me choose! Let me see. I’ll look over the inscriptions again. What does the lead box say? “He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what? For lead? Risk everything for lead? This box is too threatening. Men who risk everything hope to make profits. A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless. So I won’t give or risk anything for lead. What does the silver one say? 
“He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head. If your reputation is trustworthy, you deserve a lot—though maybe not enough to include this lady. But fearing I don’t deserve her is a way of underestimating myself. As much as I deserve—I deserve Portia! By birth I deserve her. In terms of wealth, talents, and upbringing, and especially love, I deserve her. What if I went no further and chose this one? But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia! The whole world wants her. They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint. Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia. The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream. One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture. Could the lead one contain it? No, it’d be a sin to think such a low thought. Lead’s too crass to hold her. Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold? Oh, what a sinful thought! Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold. They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface. 
Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed.—Give me the key. I will choose this one and try my chances. 
###PORTIA
(she hands him a key) There, take it, prince. And if my picture’s in there, then I’m yours. 
## MOROCCO opens the gold casket.
###MOROCCO
Damn it! What’s this? It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket. I’ll read it aloud. (he reads) “All that glitters is not gold— You’ve often heard that said. Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface. But gilded tombs contain worms. If you’d been as wise as you were bold, With an old man’s mature judgment, You wouldn’t have had to read this scroll. So goodbye—you lost your chance.” Lost my chance indeed! So goodbye hope, and hello despair. Portia, goodbye to you. My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes. Losers always leave quickly. 
## MOROCCO exits with his entourage.
###PORTIA
Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice. 
##They exit. 
## SALARINO and SOLANIO enter
###SALARINO
I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him. I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship. 
###SOLANIO
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints. The duke went with him to search Bassanio’s ship. 
###SALARINO
He got there too late. The ship was already sailing. But once he got there, the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola. In any case, Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship. 
###SOLANIO
I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets. “My daughter, oh my ducats, oh my daughter! Ran off with a Christian! Oh my Christian ducats! Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter, a sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter, and jewels—two stones, two rich and precious stones—stolen by my daughter! Justice, find the girl! She has the stones on her, and the ducats.” 
###SALARINO
I know, all the boys in Venice are following him, yelling, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!” 
###SOLANIO
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this. 
###SALARINO
That’s a good point. I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel. I thought about Antonio when he told me. I silently hoped it wasn’t his ship. 
###SOLANIO
You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly, because it might upset him. 
###SALARINO
There’s no nicer guy in the whole world. I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye. Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back. Antonio answered “Don’t rush. Don’t do a sloppy job for my sake, Bassanio. Stay until everything is finished. As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a factor in your plans. Be happy and concentrate your thoughts on love and how to win your love.” Then his eyes started tearing up. He turned his face away. Then he shook Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated. 
###SOLANIO
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio. Let’s go find him and cheer him up. 
###SALARINO
Yes, let’s do that. 
##They exit.
## NERISSA and a servant enter.
###NERISSA
Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick. The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and he’s coming to make his choice now. 
## Trumpets play. The Prince of ARRAGON, his entourage, and PORTIA enter.
###PORTIA
Look, here are the boxes, prince. If you choose the one that contains my picture, we’ll be married right away. But if you fail, you have to leave immediately. No pleas will be allowed. 
###ARRAGON
I swore I’d do three things. First, I can never tell anyone what box I choose. Second, if I choose the wrong box, I’ll never propose marriage for the rest of my life. Third, if I pick the wrong box, I’ll leave immediately. 
###PORTIA
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules. 
###ARRAGON
Okay, I’m ready. I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for! Gold, silver, and common lead. “He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you. What does the golden box say? Hmm, let me see: 
“He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy. They don’t go beyond what their eyes see. They don’t bother to find out what’s on the inside. Just like those birds called martins who build their nests on the outside of walls, people pay too much attention to what’s on the outside. So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population. So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house. Tell me once more what you say. “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves? No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve. Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption? There wouldn’t be too many important men then. How many people who are humble now would be great then? How many people who give orders now would have to take orders? How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants? And how many common people would suddenly shine with nobility? Well, let me get back to my choice. “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one. I’ll unlock my fate here in a second. 
## ARRAGON opens the silver casket.
###PORTIA
You thought about it too long, considering what you found there. 
###ARRAGON
What’s this? A picture of an idiot holding a scroll up for me to read! I’ll read it.—It looks so unlike Portia! This outcome isn’t what I hoped for, or what I deserve. “The one who chooses me will get what he deserves”! Didn’t I deserve anything more than a fool’s head? Is this my prize? Don’t I deserve more than this? 
###PORTIA
Judging what you deserve is one thing. Offending you is something very different, so I’ll keep my mouth shut. 
###ARRAGON
What does this say? (he reads) “This box was tested in the fire seven times. The person who never makes a wrong choice Has wisdom that will stand the test. Some people kiss shadows. They only feel the shadow of joy. There are fools out there With silver hair and silver coins. This choice was as foolish as they are. Take whatever wife you want to bed with you, You’ll have a fool’s head forever. So go away. You’re done here.” The longer I stay, the more foolish I look. I came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now I’m leaving with two.—Goodbye, sweet lady. I’ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger. 
##He exits with his train.
###PORTIA
These men are like moths, drawn to these boxes as if they were flames. This is how the candle burned the moth. Oh, these fools! When they choose, they only know how to lose. 
###NERISSA
You know what they say. Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry. 
###PORTIA
Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Where’s lady Portia? 
###PORTIA
Here. How can I help you, sir? 
###MESSENGER
Madam, a young Venetian man has arrived to tell us his master is about to arrive. This lord has sent gifts. Besides his nice polite greetings, his gifts are expensive. I haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love. This servant has arrived before his master the way a sweet spring day hints about a lush summer. But there’s never been an April day as promising as this. 
###PORTIA
Please don’t tell me any more. I’m almost afraid you’re going to tell me he’s a relative of yours, because you’re going so crazy praising him. Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so courteously. 
###NERISSA
I hope it’s Bassanio coming to win Portia! 
##They exit.
## SOLANIO and SALARINO enter
###SOLANIO
So, what’s the news on the Rialto? 
###SALARINO
Well, there’s a rumor that Antonio had a ship carrying expensive cargo that shipwrecked in the English Channel on the Goodwin Sands, a very dangerous sandbar. Many ships have sunk there, according to rumors. 
###SOLANIO
I hope this new rumor is a lie, like the gossiping widow’s claim that she was sorry her third husband died! But it’s true—I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if I only had a title good enough to match his!— 
###SALARINO
Come on, get to the point. 
###SOLANIO
What are you saying? Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship. 
###SALARINO
I hope that’s all he loses. 
###SOLANIO
Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew. 
## SHYLOCK enters.
How’s it going, Shylock? What’s the news among the merchants? 
###SHYLOCK
You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away. 
###SALARINO
That’s true. I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off. 
###SOLANIO
And Shylock knew his daughter was ready to run away. It’s natural for children to leave their parents. 
###SHYLOCK
She’ll be damned for it. 
###SALARINO
That’s true—if the devil’s judging her. 
###SHYLOCK
My own flesh and blood turned against me! A rebel! 
###SOLANIO
No! Your flesh still rebels at your age? 
###SHYLOCK
I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood. 
###SALARINO
You two are totally different. Your flesh is more different from hers than coal is from ivory. There’s more difference between your bloods than between red wine and white. But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea? 
###SHYLOCK
That’s another bad deal I’ve made!—a bankrupt, a spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants. Let him think about his own debt. He liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me. He used to lend money as a favor between Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt. 
###SALARINO
But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay. What’s that good for? 
###SHYLOCK
I’ll use it for fish bait. You can’t eat human flesh, but if it feeds nothing else, it’ll feed my revenge. He’s insulted me and cost me half a million ducats. He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why? Because I’m a Jew. Doesn’t a Jew have eyes? Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions? Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian? If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed? If you tickle us, don’t we laugh? If you poison us, don’t we die? And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge? If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect. If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction? Revenge. If a Christian offends a Jew, what punishment will he come up with if he follows the Christian example? Of course, the same thing—revenge! I’ll treat you as badly as you Christians taught me to—and you’ll be lucky if I don’t outdo my teachers. 
##One of ANTONIO’s SERVANTS enters.
###SERVANT
(to SOLANIO and SALARINO) My master Antonio is at his house and would like to speak to you both. 
###SALARINO
We’ve been looking for him everywhere. 
## TUBAL enters.
###SOLANIO
Here comes another Jew. You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew. 
## SOLANIO, SALARINO, and ANTONIO’s SERVANT exit.
###SHYLOCK
Hello, Tubal. Any news from Genoa? Did you find my daughter? 
###TUBAL
I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her. 
###SHYLOCK
Oh, oh, oh! One of the stolen diamonds cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt! I never felt the curse of the Jews until now. I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels! I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels! I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin! You couldn’t find out anything about them? Why? I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them. Loss upon loss! The thief left with so much, and I’m spending so much to hunt down the thief—and still I’m not satisfied! I haven’t gotten my revenge. The only luck I have is bad luck. Nobody suffers but me. Nobody’s crying except me. 
###TUBAL
Well, other men have bad luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— 
###SHYLOCK
What, what, what? Bad luck, bad luck? 
###TUBAL
He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis. 
###SHYLOCK
Thank God, thank God! Is it true, is it true? 
###TUBAL
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck. 
###SHYLOCK
Thank you, Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa. 
###TUBAL
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night. 
###SHYLOCK
Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me! I’ll never see my gold again. Eighty ducats in one shot! Eighty ducats! 
###TUBAL
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt. 
###SHYLOCK
I’m very glad about that. I’ll hound him. I’ll torture him. I’m very glad. 
###TUBAL
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey. 
###SHYLOCK
Damn her! You’re torturing me, Tubal. That was my turquoise ring! Leah gave it to me before we were married. I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys. 
###TUBAL
But Antonio’s certainly ruined. 
###SHYLOCK
That’s true, that’s very true. Tubal, go find me a police officer to arrest Antonio. Get him ready two weeks ahead of time.—I’ll take Antonio’s heart if he can’t pay. With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal. Meet me at the synagogue. 
##They exit.
## BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, and NERISSA enter with all their attendants, including a SINGER.
###PORTIA
(to BASSANIO) Please wait a day or two before making your choice. If you choose wrong, I’ll lose your company. So wait a while. Something tells me—not love, but something—that I don’t want to lose you, and you know that if I hated you I wouldn’t think that. But let me put it more clearly in case you don’t understand—though I know girls aren’t supposed to express their thoughts—I’m just saying I’d like you to stay here for a month or two before you undergo the test for me. I could tell you how to choose correctly, but then I’d be disregarding the oath I took. So I’ll never tell. But you might lose me by making the wrong choice. If you do choose wrong, you’ll make me wish for something very bad. I’d wish I had ignored my oath and told you everything. God, your eyes have bewitched me. They’ve divided me in two. One half of me is yours, and the other half—my own half, I’d call it—belongs to you too. If it’s mine, then it’s yours, and so I’m all yours. But in this awful day and age people don’t even have the right to their own property! So though I’m yours, I’m not yours. If there’s no chance for me to be yours, then it’s just bad luck. I know I’m talking too much, but I do that just to make the time last longer, and to postpone your test. 
###BASSANIO
Let me choose now. I feel tortured by all this talking. 
###PORTIA
Tortured, Bassanio? Then confess to your crime. Tell us about the treason you’ve mixed in with your love. 
###BASSANIO
The only treason I’m guilty of is worrying that I’m never going to get to enjoy you. Treason has nothing at all to do with my love. They’re as opposite as hot and cold. 
###PORTIA
Hmmm, I’m not sure I believe what you’re saying. Men under torture will confess anything. 
###BASSANIO
Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth. 
###PORTIA
All right then, confess and live. 
###BASSANIO
“Confess and love” is more like it. Oh, torture’s fun when my torturer tells me what I have to say to go free! But let me try my luck on the boxes. 
###PORTIA
Go ahead, then. I’m locked in one of them. If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him. Play some music while he chooses. Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end. And since swans need water to swim in, I’ll cry him a river when he loses. But on the other hand, he may win. What music should we play then? If he wins, the music should be like the majestic trumpets that blare when subjects bow to a newly crowned monarch. It’s the sweet sounds at daybreak that the dreaming bridegroom hears on his wedding morning, calling him to the church. 
Bassanio’s walking to the boxes now. He looks as dignified as Hercules did when he saved the princess Hesione from the sea monster. But he loves me more than Hercules loved the princess. I’ll play Hesione, and everyone else will be the bystanders watching with tear-streaked faces. We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules! If you survive, I’ll live. I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself. 
##A song plays while BASSANIO mulls over the boxes.
###SINGER
(singing) Tell me where do our desires start, In the heart or in the head? How are they created, how sustained? 
###ALL
  Answer me, answer me. 
###SINGER
(singing) Desires start in the eyes, Sustained by gazing, and desires die Very young. Let’s all mourn our dead desires. I’ll begin—Ding, dong, bell. 
###ALL
  Ding, dong, bell. 
###BASSANIO
You can’t always judge a book by its cover. People are often tricked by false appearances. In court, someone can deliver a false plea but hide its wickedness with a pretty voice. In religion, don’t serious men defend sins with Scripture, covering up evil with a show of good. Every sin in the world manages to make itself look good somehow. How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war? Take another example: beauty. It can be bought by the ounce in makeup, which works miracles. Women who wear it the most are respected the least. It’s the same thing with hair. Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful. But you can buy that kind of hair as a wig, and wigs are made from dead people’s hair. Decoration’s nothing but a danger, meant to trick and trap the viewer. A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty. Nowadays, everyone’s fooled by appearances. So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat. And I’ll have nothing to do with the pale silver either, the metal that common coins are made of. But this humble lead one, though it looks too threatening to promise me anything good, moves me more than I can say. So this is the one I choose. I hope I’m happy with my choice! 
###PORTIA
(to herself) All my other emotions are vanishing into thin air, as all my doubts and desperation and fears and jealousy are all flying away! Oh, I need to calm down, make my love and my joy less intense. I’m feeling this too strongly. Please make my love less, or I’m going to overindulge, making myself sick. 
###BASSANIO
(opening the lead box) What do we have here? A picture of beautiful Portia! What artist captured her likeness so well? Are these eyes moving? Or do they just seem to move as my eyes move? Her sweet breath forces her lips open, a lovely divider of lovely lips. And look at her hair, looking like a golden mesh to trap the hearts of men, like little flies in a cobweb. The painter was like a spider in creating it so delicately. But her eyes—how could he keep looking at them long enough to paint them? I would’ve expected that when he finished one of them, it would have enraptured him and kept him from painting the other. But I’m giving only faint praise of the picture, just as the picture, as good as it is, is only a faint imitation of the real woman herself. Here’s the scroll that sums up my fate: (he reads) “You who don’t judge by looks alone, Have better luck, and make the right choice. Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one. If you’re happy with what you’ve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny, Then turn to where your lady is, And claim her with a loving kiss.” 
A nice message. My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss. But I’m in a daze, like someone who’s just won a contest and thinks that all the applause and cheering is for him, but isn’t sure yet. And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is. 
###PORTIA
You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio. What you see is what you get. Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate. What you’re getting is an innocent and inexperienced girl. I’m happy that at least I’m not too old to learn new things. I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn. I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish. Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you. Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself. But as of right this second all these things are yours. With this ring I give them all to you. 
If you ever give away this ring or lose it, it means our love’s doomed, and I’ll have a right to be angry with you. (she gives BASSANIO the ring) 
###BASSANIO
Madam, you’ve left me speechless, but my feelings are responding to your words. I’m as confused as a crowd of people going wild after hearing their prince give a speech. But the day I take this ring off will be the day I die. If you see me without it, you can be confident I’m dead. 
###NERISSA
My lord and lady, it’s now our turn, who have been watching as our dreams came true. Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and lady!” 
###GRATIANO
My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for. And when you get married, I hope I can be married at the same time. 
###BASSANIO
Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then. 
###GRATIANO
I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord. I can fall in love just as quickly as you can, and I loved Nerissa as soon as I laid eyes on her. You fell in love with Portia, and I fell in love with Nerissa, because I’m not in the habit of delaying any more than you are, my lord. Your fate depended on those boxes, and it turns out that mine did too. I couldn’t help but chase her. I started making love vows to her till my mouth was dry. Then finally she said she loved me and would marry me if you two got married as well. 
###PORTIA
Is that true, Nerissa? 
###NERISSA
Yes, madam, it is, if it’s all right with you. 
###BASSANIO
And do you mean what you’re saying, Gratiano? 
###GRATIANO
Yes, my lord. 
###BASSANIO
Then we’d be honored to have you join us in our wedding ceremony. 
###GRATIANO
(to NERISSA) Let’s bet them a thousand ducats that we will have a son first. 
###NERISSA
You want to stake the money down now? 
###GRATIANO
Hey, if I lay down my “stake,” I’ll never be able to have a son. But who’s this coming? Lorenzo and his pagan girlfriend? What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio? 
## LORENZO and JESSICA enter with SALERIO, a messenger from Venice.
###BASSANIO
Welcome, Lorenzo and Salerio. I hope my position in this new house is firm enough to allow me the right to welcome my friends. (to PORTIA) With your permission, Portia, I welcome my good friends and countrymen. 
###PORTIA
I do too, my lord. They’re entirely welcome. 
###LORENZO
(to BASSANIO) Thank you, sir. I didn’t intend to come see you. But I ran into Salerio on the way, and he begged me to come along with him until I couldn’t say no. 
###SALERIO
That’s true, and with good reason. This letter is for you from Signor Antonio. (he gives BASSANIO a letter) 
###BASSANIO
Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing. 
###SALERIO
He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are serious. His letter will tell you how he’s doing. 
## BASSANIO opens the letter and reads it.
###GRATIANO
(pointing at JESSICA) Nerissa, welcome this stranger. —Salerio, welcome. Any news from Venice? How’s the great merchant Antonio doing? I know he’ll be happy to hear of our success. We’re like the ancient hero Jason, we went looking for the Golden Fleece and we won it! 
###SALERIO
I wish you’d won the fleece he lost. 
###PORTIA
Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale. Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much. What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you. 
###BASSANIO
Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper. My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money. When I said that, I told you the truth. But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing. I’ve borrowed money from a dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake. Here’s a letter, my dear. The paper’s like my friend’s body, and every word in it is a bleeding wound on that body.—But is it true, Salerio? Have all his business ventures failed? Not even one success? He had ships to Tripolis, Mexico, England, Lisbon, North Africa, and India, and not one of these ships avoided the rocks? 
###SALERIO
Not one, my lord. Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it. I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man. He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, the duke himself, and the highest-ranking Venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his contract, but nobody can do it. He’s determined to get the penalty specified in his contract with Antonio. 
###JESSICA
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed. And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio. 
###PORTIA
Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble? 
###BASSANIO
Yes, he’s my best friend, the kindest man and most courteous to others. He’s more honorable than anyone else in Italy. 
###PORTIA
How much does he owe the Jew? 
###BASSANIO
Three thousand ducats. 
###PORTIA
What, that’s all? Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt. I’d pay twelve thousand before I’d let a friend like that suffer in the slightest because of you. First come with me to church to get married. Then you can leave for Venice to see your friend. You have to go, because you’ll never sleep next to me peacefully without settling this. I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over. When it’s paid, bring your friend back. Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows. Come on, let’s go, because you’re going to leave me the same day we get married. Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends. Since it’s costing me a lot to marry you, I’ll think of you as even more precious. But let me hear the letter from your friend. 
###BASSANIO
(he reads) “Dear Bassanio, my ships have all been wrecked. My creditors are getting mean. My money’s almost run out. I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date. Since I’ll certainly die when he takes his collateral out of my flesh, all debts are cleared between you and me if I can just see you again before I die. In any case, do what you want. If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.” 
###PORTIA
Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go! 
###BASSANIO
Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry. But I won’t sleep till I get back. 
##They exit.
## SHYLOCK, SOLANIO, ANTONIO, and the jailer enter.
###SHYLOCK
Jailer, watch out for this one. Don’t try to convince me to feel sorry for him. This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest. Jailer, keep an eye on him. 
###ANTONIO
Listen to me, good Shylock. 
###SHYLOCK
I’m going to get my bond . Don’t try to say anything against my taking my bond. I’ve sworn an oath that I will have my bond. You called me a dog before you had any reason to. But since I’m a dog, beware my fangs. The duke will give me justice.—I do wonder, jailer, how you can be so foolish as to let this prisoner out of his cell. 
###ANTONIO
Please, listen to me. 
###SHYLOCK
I want my bond. I won’t listen to you. I want my bond, so stop talking. I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers. Don’t follow me. I’m not talking with you. I want my bond. 
##He exits.
###SOLANIO
He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans. 
###ANTONIO
Leave him alone. I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore. He wants me dead. I know the real reason. I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him. That’s why he hates me. 
###SOLANIO
I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced. 
###ANTONIO
The duke can’t deny the law, because that would threaten the security of all foreign merchants in Venice, and that’s how the city makes its money. If the government disregards the law, it will be discredited. So go. I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt. After that, I don’t care what happens. 
##They exit.
## PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, and JESSICA enter with BALTHAZAR, a servant of PORTIA’s.
###LORENZO
Madam, I hope you don’t mind my saying that I admire your noble respect for friendship, which you show in letting your husband go off to help his friend like this. If you only knew the man you’re helping out, and what a faithful gentleman he is and how much he loves your husband, I know you’d be even prouder of your kindness than you normally might be. 
###PORTIA
I’ve never regretted doing good, and I don’t now. Friends who spend a lot of time together and really care equally for each other must have many traits in common. Since Antonio’s my husband’s best friend, they must be very similar men. In that case, the money I’ve sent is a small price to pay to rescue someone who resembles my Bassanio, who’s like my own soul.—Anyway, let’s change the subject, since I feel like I’m starting to flatter myself. I have a favor to ask of you. Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back. 
I’ve sworn to God that I’ll live a life of prayer and contemplation until my husband returns. Only Nerissa will keep me company. There’s a monastery two miles away where we can stay. Please say you’ll agree, because I really need you to do this. 
###LORENZO
Madam, with all my heart. I’ll do anything you ask. 
###PORTIA
I’ve already spoken to my staff about this. They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself. So goodbye until we meet again. 
###LORENZO
I hope you can relax and enjoy yourself! 
###JESSICA
I hope you find peace and happiness, my lady. 
###PORTIA
Thank you. I wish you the same. Goodbye, Jessica. 
## JESSICA and LORENZO exit.
Now, Balthazar, you’ve always been honest and faithful to me, and I trust you still are. (she gives BALTHAZAR a letter) Take this letter to Padua as fast as you can. Make sure you put it into the hands of my cousin Bellario, the Doctor of Laws. 
And as quickly as possible, take whatever letters and clothes he gives you to the public ferry that goes back and forth to Venice. Don’t waste time talking now. Just go. I’ll meet you at the ferry. 
###BALTHAZAR
I’ll go as fast as I can, madam. 
##He exits.
###PORTIA
Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet. We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us. 
###NERISSA
Will they see us? 
###PORTIA
They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men. I’ll bet you anything that I’ll be handsomer than you when we’re both dressed up. I’ll wear my sword more gracefully, and speak like a teenage boy, and walk with a manly stride rather than my ladylike steps. I’ll talk about fights like a bragging youth, and I’ll tell cute lies about honorable ladies who fell in love with me and got sick and died when I rejected them. They just died, what could I do! Then I’ll start feeling sorry for them, wishing I hadn’t killed them. I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago. I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all. 
###NERISSA
Why, are we turning to men? 
###PORTIA
What kind of question is that! If I had a dirty mind, I’d think you meant turning to men for sex. Here, I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage, which is waiting for us at the gate. So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today. 
##They exit.
## LAUNCELOT and JESSICA enter.
###LAUNCELOT
Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers. That’s why I’m worried about you. I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think. Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell. There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope. 
###JESSICA
What hope is that, may I ask? 
###LAUNCELOT
You can hope your father isn’t your real father. Maybe your mother fooled around, and you aren’t the Jew’s daughter. 
###JESSICA
That really is an illegitimate hope. Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother. 
###LAUNCELOT
In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother. When you avoid one trap, you fall into another. You’re in trouble either way. 
###JESSICA
My husband will save me. He’s made me a Christian. 
###LAUNCELOT
He was wrong to do that. There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other. All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up. If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it. 
## LORENZO enters.
###JESSICA
I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot. Here he comes. 
###LORENZO
You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this! 
###JESSICA
No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo. Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything. He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork. 
###LORENZO
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant. The Moor is pregnant with your child, Launcelot. 
###LAUNCELOT
It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be. Well, even if she’s a less than honest woman, she’s still a lot more respectable than I thought at first. 
###LORENZO
Any fool can make puns! I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do. Go in and tell the servants to get ready for dinner. 
###LAUNCELOT
That’s already been done, sir. They’re all ready to eat dinner. 
###LORENZO
Good Lord, what a clown you are! Tell them to make the dinner. 
###LAUNCELOT
That’s also been done, sir. The word you’re looking for is “cover .” 
###LORENZO
Will you cover, then? 
###LAUNCELOT
No, sir—I know my duty. Launcelot 
###LORENZO
You keep finding ways to mock me! Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once? Please understand my simple message: go tell the servants to set the table and bring in the food, and we’ll come in to dinner. 
###LAUNCELOT
About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it. As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes. As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right. 
## LAUNCELOT exits.
###LORENZO
Oh, he’s good at bending words around! The fool has memorized a whole army full of fancy words. I know jesters in better positions, with the same talents he has. They also like to digress from the topic at hand by playing with language. Anyway, how are you, Jessica? And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife? 
###JESSICA
I like her more than I can say. Bassanio should live an upstanding life because having a wife like Portia is a blessing. It’s as if he found heaven here on earth. And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven. Imagine what would happen if two gods in heaven made a bet. If one of them used Portia as his stake, the other god would have a hard time coming up with a human woman to match her value. The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal. 
###LORENZO
As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you. 
###JESSICA
I’ll be the judge of that! 
###LORENZO
I’ll give you a chance to judge later. First let’s go to dinner. 
###JESSICA
No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood. 
###LORENZO
No, please, save it for dinner conversation. That way, no matter what you say, I’ll digest it with everything else. 
###JESSICA
In that case I’ll serve you up like a dish of food. 
##They exit.
##The DUKEThe magnificoes are the wealthiest and most important noblemen of Venice, apart from the DukeDUKE , the magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and attendants all enter.
###DUKE
Is Antonio here? 
###ANTONIO
Yes, sir, I’m here. 
###DUKE
I feel sorry for you. You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy. 
###ANTONIO
They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing. But since he remains stubborn, and there’s no legal way to protect me from his malice, I’ll just have to take what he’ll give me. I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger. 
###DUKE
One of you go call the Jew into court here. 
###SALERIO
He’s standing ready outside the door. Here he comes, my lord. 
## SHYLOCK enters.
###DUKE
Make room so he can stand in front of me. Shylock, everyone thinks—and I agree—that you’re just pretending to be cruel. They think that at the last second you’re going to show mercy and pity, which will be more surprising than the bizarre cruelty that you seem to be showing now. And even though you’re here to collect the penalty—a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh—they think you’ll not only let it go, but out of humanity and love you’ll forgive some portion of the principal he owes you too. In doing so you’ll be taking pity on him for his many recent losses, which have been large enough to send even the greatest merchant out of business, and make even the most hard-hearted Turk or Tartar feel sorry for him. What do you say? We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew. 
###SHYLOCK
I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract. If you refuse to allow me to do so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered. You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats. I won’t answer that. Let’s just say it’s because I feel like it. Is that enough of an answer? What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated? Do you have your answer yet? 
Some men don’t like roast pig, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes. There’s no sense trying to explain people’s likes and dislikes. So, to answer your question. Just as there’s no clear reason why one man doesn’t want a roast pig, or why another man can’t stand a harmless and useful cat, or another can’t tolerate bagpipes, so I can’t give a reason, and I won’t give a reason (other than the simple hate and loathing I feel for Antonio) why I’m pursuing this unprofitable case against him. Does that answer your question? 
###BASSANIO
That’s no answer, you heartless man. It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior. 
###SHYLOCK
I don’t have to give you answers that you like. 
###BASSANIO
Does everyone kill what they don’t love? 
###SHYLOCK
Does anyone hate something and not want to kill it? 
###BASSANIO
Disliking something isn’t the same thing as hating it. 
###SHYLOCK
What, would you let a snake bite you twice? 
###ANTONIO
(to BASSANIO) Please don’t bother arguing with the Jew. You might as well go stand on the beach and ask the ocean to get smaller. You might as well ask a wolf why he killed the lamb and made its mother cry. 
You might as well tell the pine trees on the mountain to stop waving their treetops when the storms blow through them. You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart. It’s the hardest thing imaginable. Therefore I’m begging you, don’t make any more offers, don’t look for other ways to stop him. Just let me receive my punishment, and let the Jew take his penalty. 
###BASSANIO
(to SHYLOCK) Instead of your three thousand ducats, here are six thousand. 
###SHYLOCK
If you offered me six times that, I wouldn’t accept it. I would choose to take my penalty. 
###DUKE
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any now? 
###SHYLOCK
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong? Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them. Should I say to you, “Set them free! Let them marry your children! Why are you making them work so hard? Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”? No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.” And that’s just how I’m answering you. The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive. It’s mine and I’m going to get it. If you refuse me, the laws of Venice have no validity. I await justice. So answer me. Will I get it? 
###DUKE
I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today. He’s a legal expert I sent for to act as judge and help settle this matter. 
###SALERIO
My lord, a messenger is waiting outside with letters from Bellario. He’s just come from Padua. 
###DUKE
Bring us the letters. Call the messenger in. 
###BASSANIO
Cheer up, Antonio! Keep up your courage, man! I’ll give the Jew my flesh, blood, bones, and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me. 
###ANTONIO
I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock, the one who deserves to die. The weakest fruit drops to the ground first, so let me drop. Bassanio, the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone. 
## NERISSA enters, disguised as a lawyer’s clerk.
###DUKE
Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua? 
###NERISSA
Yes, my lord. Bellario sends his greetings. (she gives the DUKE a letter) 
## SHYLOCK sharpens his knife on the sole of his shoe.
###BASSANIO
(to SHYLOCK) Why are you sharpening your knife so eagerly? 
###SHYLOCK
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there. 
###GRATIANO
You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew. No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred. Can’t any prayers reach your heart? 
###SHYLOCK
No, none that you’re smart enough to make. 
###GRATIANO
Oh, you’re going to hell, you disgusting dog. Killing you would be justice. You almost make me forget that I’m a Christian. You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies. Your vicious dog soul used to belong to a wolf that was killed for slaughtering humans. When he died, his cruel soul passed out of his body and went into yours while you were lying in your unholy mother’s womb. That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and ravenous. 
###SHYLOCK
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud. Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind. I stand here with the law on my side. 
###DUKE
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert. Where is he? 
###NERISSA
He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in. 
###DUKE
With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud. (he reads) “I’ve received your letter but I’m very sick at the moment. As it happened, when your messenger came, a young lawyer from Rome was visiting me. His name is Balthazar. I told him about the case of the Jew and Antonio the merchant, and we consulted many books together. He knows my legal opinions about this matter, and he has his own expert opinions as well. I’m sending him in my place to answer your request for someone to act as judge in this matter. Please don’t underestimate him because he’s so young. I never knew such a young man with such a mature head. I leave him to you. When you put him to the test, you’ll see how wonderful he really is. You hear what the wise and educated Bellario writes.” 
## PORTIA enters disguised as Balthazar, a lawyer.
And this is the legal professor, I take it.—Let me shake your hand. Did old Bellario send you here? 
###PORTIA
Yes, my lord. 
###DUKE
Welcome. Please have a seat. Are you familiar with the case currently before the court? 
###PORTIA
Yes, thoroughly. Which one is the merchant? And which one is the Jew? 
###DUKE
Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward. 
###PORTIA
Is your name Shylock? 
###SHYLOCK
Shylock is my name. 
###PORTIA
Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.—(to ANTONIO) He has a claim on you, correct? 
###ANTONIO
Yes, so he says. 
###PORTIA
Do you acknowledge the contract? 
###ANTONIO
Yes, I do. 
###PORTIA
Then the Jew must show you mercy. 
###SHYLOCK
Why do I have to do that? Tell me. 
###PORTIA
No one shows mercy because he has to. It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground. Mercy is a double blessing. It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it. It’s strongest in the strongest people. It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him. The king’s scepter represents his earthly power, the symbol of majesty, the focus of royal authority. But mercy is higher than the scepter. It’s enthroned in the hearts of kings, a quality of God himself. Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice. So although justice is your plea, Jew, consider this. 
Justice won’t save our souls. We pray for mercy, and this same prayer teaches us to show mercy to others as well. I’ve told you this to make you give up this case. If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there. 
###SHYLOCK
I take all responsibility for my decisions. I want the law, the penalty, and the fulfillment of my contract. 
###PORTIA
Can’t he pay back the money? 
###BASSANIO
Yes. I’m offering to pay it back right this moment—even twice the sum. If that’s not enough, I’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much, and I’ll give you my hands, my head, and my heart as security. If that’s not enough, then you’re just evil and malicious.—(to the DUKE) I beg you, just this once, use your authority to bend the law. Do a great right by doing a little wrong. Don’t let this devil have his way. 
###PORTIA
That can’t happen. There’s no power in Venice that can change an established decree. The change will be recorded as a precedent, and many bad legal decisions will result. That can’t happen. 
###SHYLOCK
A Daniel has come to judgment, yes, a Daniel!—Oh, wise young judge, I honor you! 
###PORTIA
Please, let me review the contract. 
###SHYLOCK
(he hands PORTIA a paper) Here it is, judge, here it is. 
###PORTIA
Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent. 
###SHYLOCK
But I made an oath, an oath, an oath in heaven. Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it? No, not for all of Venice. 
###PORTIA
The money wasn’t paid back! And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant’s heart, to be cut off by him.—But please have mercy. Take three times your money. Tell me to tear up this contract. 
###SHYLOCK
I’ll tear it up when it’s paid. You seem like a good judge. You know the law. Your explanation has made sense. I urge you to deliver your verdict. I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind. I’m sticking to the contract. 
###ANTONIO
I beg the court to deliver the verdict. 
###PORTIA
Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife. 
###SHYLOCK
Oh, good judge! Oh, you excellent young man! 
###PORTIA
The law fully authorizes the penalty, which you have to pay according to the contract. 
###SHYLOCK
Very true. Oh wise judge! You’re so much older than you look! 
###PORTIA
(to ANTONIO) So bare your chest. 
###SHYLOCK
Yes, his chest! That’s what the contract says, doesn’t it, judge? “Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words. 
###PORTIA
Yes. Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh? 
###SHYLOCK
I have it ready. 
###PORTIA
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to death. 
###SHYLOCK
Is that called for in the contract? 
###PORTIA
Not explicitly, but so what? It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable. 
###SHYLOCK
I can’t find it. It’s not in the contract. 
###PORTIA
(to ANTONIO) You, merchant, do you have anything to say? 
###ANTONIO
Not much. I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio. Goodbye. 
Don’t be sad that this happened because of you, because Lady Luck’s been nicer to me than usual. Usually she makes the unhappy man live on after he loses his wealth, to spend his old age in poverty. But in my case she’s letting me avoid that misery. Send your honorable wife my greetings, and tell her how I died and how I loved you. Speak well of me after I’m dead, and when the tale’s done, ask her to judge whether Bassanio had a friend. Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your friend—your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt. If the Jew cuts deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart. 
###BASSANIO
Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself. But life itself, my wife, and the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is. I’d give it all up—yes, I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here—to save you. 
###PORTIA
Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer. 
###GRATIANO
I have a wife I love. I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind. 
###NERISSA
It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back. That wish of yours could start quite an argument back at home. 
###SHYLOCK
That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands. I have a daughter. I wish she’d married any one of Barabbas’s descendants instead of a Christian!—We’re wasting time. Please, deliver the sentence. 
###PORTIA
A pound of this merchant’s flesh is yours. The court awards it and the law authorizes it. 
###SHYLOCK
What a righteous judge! 
###PORTIA
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest. The law allows it, and the court awards it. 
###SHYLOCK
What a wise judge! Come on, get ready. 
###PORTIA
But wait a moment. There’s something else. This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all. The words expressly specify “a pound of flesh.” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh, but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it, the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law. 
###GRATIANO
Oh, what an upright judge!—Pay attention, Jew.—Oh, what a smart judge! 
###SHYLOCK
Is that the law? 
###PORTIA
You can see for yourself. You asked for justice, so rest assured you’ll get more justice than you bargained for. 
###GRATIANO
Oh, what a wise judge!—Pay attention, Jew. A wise judge! 
###SHYLOCK
In that case I’ll take their offer. Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go. 
###BASSANIO
Here is the money. 
###PORTIA
Wait! The Jew will have justice. Wait, don’t rush! He’s not getting anything except the penalty. 
###GRATIANO
Oh, Jew, what an upright judge this is! What a wise judge! 
###PORTIA
So get ready to cut off the flesh. Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh. If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated. 
###GRATIANO
A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew! I’ve got you now, pagan. 
###PORTIA
Why is the Jew waiting? Take your penalty. 
###SHYLOCK
Give me my money and let me go. 
###BASSANIO
I have it ready for you. Here it is. 
###PORTIA
No, he refused it publicly, in open court. He will have only justice and his penalty. 
###GRATIANO
A Daniel, I keep saying it! A second Daniel!—Thank you, Jew, for teaching me that word. 
###SHYLOCK
I won’t even get the original three thousand ducats back? 
###PORTIA
You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril, Jew. 
###SHYLOCK
Well, then, I hope he chokes on it! I’m not staying here to argue anymore. 
###PORTIA
Wait a minute, Jew. The law has another hold on you. The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods. The other half goes to the state. Whether the offending person lives or dies is up to the duke—there’s no one else to appeal to. In your predicament you’ve earned that punishment, because you’ve clearly contrived indirectly—and directly too—to take the life of the defendant. So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke. 
###GRATIANO
Beg to be allowed to hang yourself! But if you’ve handed over all your wealth to the state, you don’t even have enough money left to buy a rope. So you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense. 
###DUKE
I want you to see the difference between us, so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon. Half of your wealth goes to Antonio. The other half goes to the state. However, if you show a proper humility, I may reduce this penalty to a fine. 
###PORTIA
Yes, the state’s half can be reduced, but not Antonio’s. 
###SHYLOCK
No, go ahead and take my life. Don’t pardon that. You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep. You take my life when you take away my means of making a living. 
###PORTIA
What mercy can you show him, Antonio? 
###GRATIANO
A hangman’s rope free of charge. Nothing else, for God’s sake! 
###ANTONIO
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property, I’m happy, as long as he lets me have the other half in trust, to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter. I only ask two more things. First, Shylock must immediately become a Christian. Second, he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies. 
###DUKE
He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered. 
###PORTIA
Are you satisfied, Jew? What do you say? 
###SHYLOCK
I’m satisfied. 
###PORTIA
(to NERISSA) Clerk, draw up a document to make his gift official. 
###SHYLOCK
Please let me go. I’m not well. Send the deed after me and I’ll sign it. 
###DUKE
Go, but sign the deed. 
###GRATIANO
(to SHYLOCK) When you’re baptized a Christian, you’ll have two godfathers. If I’d been the judge, you would’ve had ten more—twelve jurors to sentence you to death rather than baptism. 
## SHYLOCK exits.
###DUKE
(to PORTIA) Sir, please come home with me to dinner. 
###PORTIA
I’m very sorry, sir, but I have to go to Padua tonight. I should really leave right away. 
###DUKE
I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this gentleman a reward. In my opinion, you owe him a lot. 
##The DUKE and his entourage exit.
###BASSANIO
(to PORTIA) Sir, thanks to you my friend and I have been freed from paying some awful penalties today. Instead of giving the Jew the three thousand ducats he’s owed, we give it to you in gratitude for your kind efforts. 
###ANTONIO
And even then we’re still indebted to you. We owe you love and service forever. 
###PORTIA
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough. In saving you I consider myself well paid. My thoughts were never on money. I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again. I wish you well. Now, I’ve got to go. 
###BASSANIO
Sir, I really feel the need to give you something. Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude, not as a fee. Please do two favors for me. First, don’t refuse me, and second, excuse me for insisting. 
###PORTIA
Since you keep insisting, I’ll do as you say. (to ANTONIO) Give me your gloves. I’ll wear them for your sake. (to BASSANIO) And as a souvenir of your appreciation, I’ll take this ring from you. Don’t pull your hand back. I won’t take anything more than this, and you can’t refuse me this. 
###BASSANIO
This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing. I’d be ashamed to give you this. 
###PORTIA
I don’t want anything but that. Now that I think about it, I really want it. 
###BASSANIO
There’s more to this ring than its cash value. I’ll give you the most expensive ring in Venice, and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it. But as for this ring, please excuse me. 
###PORTIA
I see you like to make big offers, sir. First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered. 
###BASSANIO
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife. When she put it on my finger, she made me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it. 
###PORTIA
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts. If your wife’s not a madwoman, and you tell her how much I deserve this ring, she won’t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me. Well, anyway, goodbye. 
## PORTIA and NERISSA exit.
###ANTONIO
Bassanio, let him have the ring. Consider how much he deserves it, and weigh that, along with my friendship, against your wife’s order. 
###BASSANIO
(he gives GRATIANO the ring) Go, Gratiano, run and catch up with him. Give him the ring, and take him to Antonio’s house if you can. Go quickly. 
## GRATIANO exits.
Come on, you and I will go soon. Early in the morning we’ll both rush to Belmont. Come on, Antonio. 
##They exit.
## PORTIA and NERISSA enter, both still in disguise.
###PORTIA
Find out where the Jew’s house is. Give him this deed and have him sign it. We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back. Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done. 
## GRATIANO enters.
###GRATIANO
(he gives PORTIA BASSANIO’s ring) Sir, you’re lucky I caught up with you. Bassanio thought about it some more and sent this ring to you. He would like to invite you to dinner. 
###PORTIA
I can’t have dinner with him. Please tell him I accept his ring with thanks. And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house? 
###GRATIANO
I’ll do that. 
###NERISSA
(to PORTIA) Sir, may I speak with you? (speaking so that only PORTIAcan hear) I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring, which I made him swear to keep forever. 
###PORTIA
(to NERISSA) I bet you’ll be able to. They’ll swear they gave the rings to men. But we’ll deny it and outswear them too.— 
Go, hurry. You know where I’ll be waiting. 
##She exits.
###NERISSA
(to GRATIANO) Sir, will you show me to Shylock’s house now? 
##They exit.
## LORENZO and JESSICA enter.
###LORENZO
The moon’s bright tonight. I think that on a night like this, when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound, Troilus climbed up onto the walls of Troy and sighed for Cressida in the Greek camp. 
###JESSICA
On a night like this, Thisbe saw the lion’s shadow and ran away in fear. 
###LORENZO
On a night like this, Dido stood holding a willow branch on the seashore, begging her lover to come back to her in Carthage. 
###JESSICA
On a night like this, Medea gathered magic herbs to rejuvenate old Aeson. 
###LORENZO
On a night like this, Jessica ran away from the wealthy Jew and stole his money. She ran away from Venice all the way to Belmont with her spendthrift lover. 
###JESSICA
On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart with vows of love, but not one vow was true. 
###LORENZO
On a night like this, pretty Jessica, in a bad mood, said outrageously wrong things about her lover, and he forgave her. 
###JESSICA
I’d get the better of you in this storytelling game, but somebody’s coming. I hear his footsteps. 
## STEPHANO, a messenger, enters.
###LORENZO
Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night? 
###STEPHANO
A friend. 
###LORENZO
A friend? What friend? What’s your name, please, friend? 
###STEPHANO
My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise. She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying for a happy marriage. 
###LORENZO
Who’s coming with her? 
###STEPHANO
No one except her maid and a holy hermit. Has my master returned yet? 
###LORENZO
No, he hasn’t, and we haven’t heard from him.—But let’s go in, Jessica. We’ll get ready to welcome the mistress of the house back home. 
## LAUNCELOT enters.
###LAUNCELOT
Hey, hey! Hey! Yoo-hoo! 
###LORENZO
Who’s shouting? 
###LAUNCELOT
Hey! Have you seen Master Lorenzo! Master Lorenzo, hey! Hey! 
###LORENZO
Stop hollering, man! I’m here. 
###LAUNCELOT
Hey! Where, where? 
###LORENZO
Here. 
###LAUNCELOT
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news. My master will be here in the morning. 
## LAUNCELOT exits.
###LORENZO
My dear, let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive. But I guess it doesn’t matter. Why should we go in?—Stephano, tell the household staff that your mistress is about to arrive, and bring some musicians outside here. 
## STEPHANO exits.
How beautiful the moonlight’s shining on this bank! Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears. Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music. Sit down, Jessica. Look at the stars, see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold. Stars and planets move in such perfect harmony that some believe you can hear music in their movement. If you believe this, even the smallest star sings like an angel in its motion. Souls have that same kind of harmony. But because we’re here on earth in our earthly bodies, we can’t hear it. 
##Musicians enter.
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn! Get her attention and draw her home with music. 
##Music plays.
###JESSICA
I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music. 
###LORENZO
That’s because your soul is paying attention to the music. Take a wild herd of animals, or young untrained colts, leaping around like crazy, roaring and neighing loudly, which they have to do because it’s in their blood—but if they happen to hear a trumpet, or any kind of music, they all stand still. Sweet music makes their wild eyes peaceful. That’s why the poet Ovid wrote that the great musician Orpheus could make 
trees, stones, and rivers come to him by playing music. There’s nothing in the world that can resist music. The man who can’t be moved by the harmonious melodies is fit only for treason, violence, and pillage. His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld. Nobody like that should be trusted. Pay attention to the music. 
## PORTIA and NERISSA enter.
###PORTIA
That light we see is coming from my hall. Look how far that little candle sends its light! That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world. 
###NERISSA
While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle. 
###PORTIA
Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones. A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody. Music, listen! 
###NERISSA
It’s your music, madam, from your house. 
###PORTIA
Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context. I think that music sounds much better at night than it does during the day. 
###NERISSA
The night’s silence makes it sound better. 
###PORTIA
The crow sings as well as the lark when no one’s listening. If the nightingale sang during the day, when every goose is honking, nobody would think it sang any better than a wren. How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen! Quiet now! Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken! 
##Music ceases.
###LORENZO
If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice. 
###PORTIA
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice. 
###LORENZO
Dear lady, welcome home. 
###PORTIA
We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare. We hope they’re better off because of our prayers. Have they come back? 
###LORENZO
No, ma'am, they haven’t. But a messenger came ahead to tell us they were on their way. 
###PORTIA
Go inside, Nerissa. Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone. You must not, either, Lorenzo—or you, Jessica. 
##A trumpet sounds.
###LORENZO
Your husband’s near. I hear his trumpet. We’re not tattle-tales, madam, don’t worry. 
###PORTIA
I think this night is just like sick daylight. It only looks a little paler. It looks like a day when the sun is hidden. 
## GRATIANO and NERISSA move aside and talk BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers enter. GRATIANO and NERISSA move aside and talk.
###BASSANIO
(to PORTIA) If you walked outside at night, it would be daylight here at the same time as on the other side of the world. 
###PORTIA
I’ll give light to men, but I’ll never be light or unchaste. An unfaithful wife makes a husband worry, and I’ll never let Bassanio worry if I can help it. I hope God figures it all out! Welcome home, my husband. 
###BASSANIO
Thank you, darling. I’d like to introduce you to my friend. This is Antonio, my dearest friend. We are closely tied. 
###PORTIA
You should be tied to him, since he tied himself up so much for you. 
###ANTONIO
But I’ve been paid back well. 
###PORTIA
Sir, welcome to our house. But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut short these polite words. 
###GRATIANO
(to NERISSA) I swear by that moon over there that you’re doing me wrong! I’m telling the truth! I gave it to the judge’s clerk. I wish the guy I gave it to had been castrated, since you’re getting so upset about it. 
###PORTIA
What, an argument already? What’s the matter? 
###GRATIANO
We’re arguing about a hoop of gold, a cheap little ring she gave me, that had a little inscription on it, nothing more than a knife-maker’s attempt at poetry. It said, “Love me and don’t leave me.” 
###NERISSA
How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring? You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you. If you didn’t want to take care of it for my sake, you should have just because you made so many vows that you’d take care of it. And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk! No, I swear to God that clerk will never grow a beard on his face. 
###GRATIANO
He will if he lives long enough to become a man. 
###NERISSA
Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man. 
###GRATIANO
I swear I gave it to a youth, a kind of boy, a little stunted boy, no taller than yourself. He was the judge’s clerk, a chatty boy who wanted it as a fee. I didn’t have the heart to say no to him. 
###PORTIA
I have to be honest with you. You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body. 
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away. And here he is. I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world. To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset. If it were me, I’d be very upset too. 
###BASSANIO
(to himself) Maybe I should cut off my left hand and swear I lost the ring defending it. 
###GRATIANO
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too. And then his clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine. Neither of them would take anything but the two rings. 
###PORTIA
Which ring did you give away, my lord? Not the one I gave you, I hope. 
###BASSANIO
If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it. But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it. It’s gone. 
###PORTIA
Just as there’s no ring on your finger, there’s no truth in your heart. I swear I’ll never get into your bed until I see the ring again! 
###NERISSA
(to GRATIANO) Me neither, until I see mine again! 
###BASSANIO
My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry. 
###PORTIA
If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t have let it go. Who would be so unreasonable as to insist on taking the ring if you’d defended it with any kind of zeal? Who would have had so little self-restraint that they’d insist on getting a ring with ceremonial value? Nerissa’s got the right idea. I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring! 
###BASSANIO
No, I swear, madam. No woman got it from me, but an expert in civil law who refused three thousand ducats but asked instead for the ring, which I denied him. I watched him leave looking discontented, even though he had saved the life of my good friend. What could I say, my dear? I had to send it to him. I was ashamed and wanted to show my good manners. I just couldn’t dishonor myself by acting ungrateful to him. Please forgive me, good lady. If you’d been there, I think you would have begged me to give him the ring. 
###PORTIA
Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house! Since he has the jewel I loved, which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to him. I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my husband’s bed. I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it. So don’t spend one night away from this house. Watch me like a hawk. If you don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow. 
###NERISSA
(to GRATIANO) And I’ll have his clerk as mine. So be careful when you leave me to my own devices. 
###GRATIANO
Well, go ahead. But don’t let me catch him, because if I do I’ll break that clerk’s pen. 
###ANTONIO
All these quarrels are about me. 
###PORTIA
Don’t be upset. You’re welcome in our home in spite of everything that’s going on. 
###BASSANIO
Portia, forgive me for this mistake that I had to make. All these friends are my witnesses, so I swear to you, I swear by your beautiful eyes, in which I see myself reflected— 
###PORTIA
Did you hear that! He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him. He should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll believe! 
###BASSANIO
No, just listen to me. If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again. 
###ANTONIO
I lent my body once to make him rich. If it hadn’t been for the gentleman who now owns your husband’s ring, my body would’ve been lost. I’d be the guarantee again, promising my soul this time as penalty, if your husband ever breaks a vow again knowingly. 
###PORTIA
(she gives ANTONIO a ring) Then you’ll be my guarantee. Give him this. And tell him to hold on to it better than the other one. 
###ANTONIO
(he gives BASSANIO PORTIA’s ring) Here, Bassanio, swear that you’ll keep this ring. 
###BASSANIO
My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge! 
###PORTIA
I got it from him. I’m sorry, Bassanio, but the legal expert slept with me in exchange for this ring.    
###NERISSA
(she takes out a ring) And I’m sorry too, Gratiano, but that stunted lawyer’s clerk slept with me last night in exchange for this ring. 
###gratiano
This is like fixing roads in the summer when they don’t need to be fixed! What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it? 
###PORTIA
Don’t be crass.—You all look confused. (she takes out a letter) Here’s a letter. Read it at your leisure. It comes from Padua, from Bellario. You’ll find out that Portia was the lawyer, and Nerissa was her clerk. Lorenzo here will testify that I left the house right when you did, and just returned. I haven’t yet entered my house.—Antonio, welcome. I have better news than you expect in store for you. (she gives ANTONIO another letter) Open this letter. You’ll find out that three of your ships have suddenly arrived in the harbor loaded with a great deal of wealth. You’ll never guess what a strange coincidence it was that I came across this letter. 
###ANTONIO
I’m speechless. 
###BASSANIO
(to PORTIA) You were the doctor, and I didn’t even recognize you? 
###GRATIANO
(to NERISSA) Were you the clerk with whom my wife’s going to cheat on me? 
###NERISSA
Yes, but the clerk will never do it, unless he grows up to be a man. 
###BASSANIO
(to PORTIA) My sweet lawyer, you’ll be my bedfellow. When I’m not there, you can sleep with my wife. 
###ANTONIO
Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too. I’ve read in this letter that my ships have safely come to harbor. 
###PORTIA
How are you, Lorenzo? My clerk has some comforting news for you, too. 
###NERISSA
Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free. (she gives LORENZO a document) This is from the rich Jew, for you and Jessica. It’s a special testament. After he dies, you’ll inherit everything he owns. 
###LORENZO
Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people. 
###PORTIA
It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened. Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully. 
###GRATIANO
All right, then. My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning. When the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk. In any case, I won’t worry about anything for the rest of my life more than keeping Nerissa’s ring safe. 
##They exit.

##The DUKE, EGEON, and the JAILER enter, with other attendants.
###EGEON
Continue, Solinus, and bring on my downfall. Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles. 
###DUKE
Merchant of Syracuse, stop your begging: I’m not inclined to bend our laws. The hatred and discord between our two cities is the result of the bitter offenses your duke has perpetrated against the merchants of Ephesus, our well-behaved countrymen. Lacking the money to ransom themselves, these merchants were executed under your duke’s harsh laws, and this has erased all looks of pity from my face. Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns. No–the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself. Your possessions, even if we calculate their worth very generously, don’t even add up to a hundred marks. Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die. 
###EGEON
At least I have this comfort: when you finish speaking, my troubles will also end, at sundown. 
###DUKE
Well, Syracusian, tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus. 
###EGEON
Asking me to speak of my unspeakable griefs–that’s the hardest task you could impose on me. But I’ll do it so that the world can see that it was natural emotion, and not a desire to break the law, that brought me to this fate. I’ll tell you whatever my sorrow permits me to say. I was born in Syracuse, and I married a woman–a fortunate woman, except for having been married to me. And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad. I lived with her in joy, and our wealth increased from the prosperous journeys I frequently made to Epidamnum. Then my agent died and, obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad, I was drawn away from my wife’s fond embraces. I hadn’t been gone for six months when my wife, almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy, made arrangements to follow me, and she soon arrived safely where I was. She hadn’t been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys. It was strange: they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names. In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys. Their parents had very little, so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons. My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys, and every day she would press me to return home. Reluctantly, I agreed–alas! Too quickly, we boarded a ship. 
We had sailed a league away from Epidamnum before the sea, which always obeys the winds' commands, gave any indication of danger. We didn’t stay hopeful much longer: soon, the sky grew so dark that we were convinced we were going to die immediately. I could have accepted that, but I was forced by my wife’s incessant weeping–she wept in advance for the things that she saw ahead–and the piteous complaints of the sweet infants–who cried in imitation of the adults, without understanding why–to find a way to save us. Here’s the best I could do: the crew of our ship had fled for safety in the lifeboats and left us to sink with the ship. My wife, who was very concerned about the younger of our twins, tied him to a spare mast–the kind that sailors use for just such a purpose. She tied one of the other twins to him. I did the same with the remaining two boys. With the children taken care of, my wife and I tied ourselves to opposite ends of the mast and floated off, obedient to the current. It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought. Eventually the sun, looking down upon the earth, burned off the threatening storm clouds. By the power of the sun’s wished-for light, the seas became calm. We saw two ships sailing toward us, one from Corinth, the other from Epidaurus. But before they reached us–let me say no more! You’ll have to imagine what came next, based on what had already happened. 
###DUKE
No, keep going, old man; don’t stop like that. For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you. 
###EGEON
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless. The two ships hadn’t come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle. As we were unjustly separated from each other, both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over. For her part–the poor soul! Her half of the mast weighed less, but she was no luckier than I was: the wind carried her away more quickly. I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinth–or so I thought. After a while, another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me. The sailors knew me, so they took good care of us. Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children, but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home. So now you’ve heard how I was separated from everything I love. It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes. 
###DUKE
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point. 
###EGEON
My youngest son, whom I care about the most, turned eighteen and started to wonder about his twin brother. He asked me to let him take his attendant–who had also lost a brother, though he had kept his brother’s 
name for himself–and go in search of him. I wanted to see my lost son as well, so I risked losing the one I loved in order to find the other. I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia. On my way home, I came to Ephesus. I have no hope of finding my boys here, but I will check every place that is inhabited by men. But that is where the story of my life must end. I’d be happy to die if, in all my travels, I could prove that they are alive. 
###DUKE
Poor Egeon! Fate has decreed that you must endure the extremes of terrible misfortune. Believe me, if it weren’t against the law, my crown, my duty, and my position (which princes cannot disobey, not matter how they feel), my very soul would argue your case. But you are sentenced to death, and changing a sentence that’s already been passed would dishonor my title. However, I’ll do what I can for you. I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus. Call any friends you have. Beg or borrow to come up with the ransom. If you can, you live. If not, you are doomed to die. Jailer, take him into custody. 
###JAILER
I will. 
###EGEON
Hopeless and helpless, I go my way, merely putting off my fatal end. 
##They exit.
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST MERCHANT enter.
###FIRST MERCHANT
So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated. Just today, a merchant from Syracuse was arrested for coming here. He couldn’t afford the ransom, so by law, he’ll be put to death before the sun sets. Here’s the money you asked me to hold. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where we’re lodging, and wait there until I come. It’ll be lunchtime within an hour. Until then, I’ll walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn. I’m stiff and weary from all this travel. Get going now. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money. 
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE exists.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
He’s a trustworthy servant. Often, when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks. Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn? 
###FIRST MERCHANT
Begging your pardon, but I’ve been invited to see some merchants, who I’m hoping to see a profit from. But if 
it pleases you, I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime. Right now, my pressing business calls me away. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Farewell till then. I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city. 
###FIRST MERCHANT
Sir, I leave you to your own contentment. 
## FIRST MERCHANT exits.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
He leaves me to my own contentment, but that’s the one thing I cannot find. Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean. When that drop fails its task–unnoticed, inquisitive–it dissipates into the ocean and destroys itself. In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily. 
## DROMIO OF EPHESUS enters.
Here comes the man who shares my birthday. What is it? How is it that you’ve come back so soon? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Back so soon? Too late is more like it. The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek. She’s hot because lunch is cold; lunch is cold because you’re not home; you’re not home because you’re not hungry; you’re not hungry because you’ve eaten already. But we servants—who know how to properly fast and pray—are being punished for your offenses today. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Hold on a second. Answer me this, please: where’s the money I gave you? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress? The saddle maker has it, sir—I didn’t keep it. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I’m not in a joking mood. Tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money? We’re strangers here. How dare you let such a large amount escape your keeping? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch. My mistress made me hurry here. If I go back without you, she’ll punish your faults by breaking my head open. I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
That’s enough, Dromio, please. This isn’t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time. Where’s the gold I gave you? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Gave me, sir? You didn’t give me any gold. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Come on, you rogue. Quit joking. Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch. My mistress and her sister are waiting for you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money, or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood. Where are the thousand marks you had from me? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I have some marks from you on my head and some of my mistress’s marks on my body. But between the both of you, I don’t have a thousand marks. If I gave those marks back to you, chances are you wouldn’t take them as patiently as I did. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your mistress’s marks? What mistress do you have? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Your wife, sir. My mistress. At the Phoenix. The one who’s waiting for you to come home for lunch and praying that you’ll get home quickly. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to? There, take that, you scoundrel! (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS) 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
What are you doing? Stop, for God’s sake! Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here. 
## DROMIO OF EPHESUS exits.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money. They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins. If this is true, then I’ll be leaving all the sooner. I’ll go to the Centaur to find this servant of mine—I fear that my money isn’t safe. 
##He exits.
## ADRIANA and LUCIANA enter.
###ADRIANA
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running. Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o'clock. 
###LUCIANA
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch. Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying. A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases. If this is so, be patient, sister. 
###ADRIANA
Why should men be more free than women? 
###LUCIANA
Because their business lies outside the home. 
###ADRIANA
Listen, when I behave this way toward him, he hates it. 
###LUCIANA
Oh, you should know that he’s the bridle to your will. 
###ADRIANA
Only a mule would agree to that. 
###LUCIANA
Why, too much freedom leads to woe. There’s nothing under heaven that doesn’t have its limits. The beasts on the earth, the fish in the sea, and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control. Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures. And men—the lords of the wide 
world and the wild watery seas, gifted with intellectual sense and souls, greater than the fish and the birds—are the masters of women and their lords. Therefore, you should obey their wishes. 
###ADRIANA
It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried. 
###LUCIANA
No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed. 
###ADRIANA
But if you were married, you’d wield some influence. 
###LUCIANA
Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders. 
###ADRIANA
What if your husband strays elsewhere? 
###LUCIANA
I’d endure it until he came home again. 
###ADRIANA
Now that’s patience! No wonder she’s waiting to get married. It’s easy to preach meekness when you have no reason to act otherwise. When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up. And yet, if we were suffering the same kind of pain, we’d complain just as much—if not more! So you, who have no husband causing you problems, want to comfort me by preaching the virtue of feeble patience. But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you. 
###LUCIANA
Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see. Here comes your servant—your husband must be coming soon. 
## DROMIO OF EPHESUS enters.
###ADRIANA
Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No; but he came at me with two hands—just ask my ears. 
###ADRIANA
Did you talk to him? Do you know his plans? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Yes, yes, he told me his plans on my ears. Damn his hands—I could barely understand it. 
###LUCIANA
Did he speak so ambiguously that you couldn’t get a feeling for what he meant? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No; he hit me very clearly and I felt his punches perfectly well. They were so dreadful, I could barely stand up under them. 
###ADRIANA
But please, tell me: is he coming home? It seems he has taken great care to please his wife. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns. 
###ADRIANA
Horns? You bastard! 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I don’t mean he’s cuckold mad. But he sure is angry. When I asked him to come home to lunch, he asked me for a thousand marks. “It’s lunchtime,” I said. “My gold,” he said. “The meat’s burning,” I said. “My gold,” he said. “Will you come home?” I said. 
“My gold,” he said. “Where’s the thousand marks I gave you, scoundrel?” “The pig,” I said, “is burned.” “My gold,” he said. “My mistress,” I said. “Damn your mistress! I don’t know your mistress, the hell with your mistress!” 
###LUCIANA
Who said that? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
My master said it. “I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders. Because at the end of it all, that’s where he beat me. 
###ADRIANA
Go back again, slave, and bring him home. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Go back again, to be beaten home again? For God’s sake, send somebody else. 
###ADRIANA
Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And he’ll add another knock across. With all these crosses, I’ll have a holy head. 
###ADRIANA
Get out of here, you blathering peasant! Bring your master home. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Do I treat you this roundly? You’re kicking me around like I’m a football. You kick me out, he kicks me back. If I keep working for you, I’m going to end up wrapped in leather, like a football. 
## DROMIO OF EPHESUS exits.
###LUCIANA
Look at you! You have impatience all over your face. 
###ADRIANA
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him. Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks? That’s because he has squandered my beauty. Am I boring? Have I lost my wit? If my conversation is no longer free and clever, that’s because he’s dulled it—I’m like a sharp tool he’s blunted with a hard piece of marble. Is he charmed by their pretty clothes? Well, that’s not my fault—he’s the one in charge of my spending. What faults can you find in me that weren’t first caused by him? One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty. But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures. I am nothing but a poor, used fool. 
###LUCIANA
This jealousy is harming only you! Drive it out of you. 
###ADRIANA
Only someone who doesn’t feel this pain could tell me to ignore it. I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here? Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace. I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me. Even the best jewel can be tarnished. Gold, however, can’t be corrupted—though it can be worn down if it’s touched too often. And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior. Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping. 
###LUCIANA
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy! 
##They exit.
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE enters.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me. I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier. Here he comes. 
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enters.
So, sir. Are you over your ridiculous mood? If you like being hit, crack some more jokes. You never heard of the Centaur? You weren’t given any gold? Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner? The Phoenix is my house? Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Said what, sir? When did I say all that? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Just now. Right here. Less than half an hour ago. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You moron, you denied having any gold, and you told me about a mistress and a lunch. And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood. But what’s the joke? Please, master, tell me. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What, are you mocking me to my face? You think I’m joking? Here. Take that, and that! (beats DROMIO OF SYRACUSE) 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Stop, sir, for God’s sake! Now this joke has turned serious. Why are you doing this? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection. You pull pranks when I’m in a serious mood. You know, foolish gnats come out in the sunshine, but they creep back into their holes when it’s dark. If you want to crack jokes, first check what kind of mood I’m in and then adjust your behavior to suit me. If you don’t learn this rule, I’ll have to beat it into your sconce. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
You call it my “sconce”? I’d rather call it my “head” so you’d stop battering it. If you keep pounding me, I’ll need a sconce to wrap my head with, or else I’ll have to keep my brain in my chest. But sir, why are you beating me? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Don’t you know? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
All I know is that I’m being beaten. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Should I tell you why? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, and wherefore. You know the old saying: “Every ‘why’ has a ‘wherefore.’” 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
“Why” first: for defying me. And then “wherefore”: for doing it a second time. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I don’t think any man’s ever been beaten for a “why” and “wherefore” that made so little sense. Well, thank you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Thank me? For what? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because you gave me something for nothing. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Next time I’ll give you nothing for something. Is it lunchtime? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No. The meat lacks something that I have. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What would that be? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
A basting. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, then it will be dry. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why not? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time. There’s a time for all things. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why not? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Let’s hear it. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Can’t he get it by fine and recovery? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, he can pay a fine for a wig and then recover another man’s lost hair. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair? After all, it’s plentiful in its growth. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because animals are blessed with hair. With men, he’s been stingy with hair, but he makes up for it by giving them intelligence. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
And not one of them is smart enough to stop himself from going bald. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The more simpleminded they are, the sooner they lose their hair. But they have a good time doing so. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Two reasons. And good ones, too. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Not good ones, please. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then sure ones. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then certain ones. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Name them. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Right, and I did, sir. There’s no time to get back hair that’s fallen out. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You didn’t come up with a very good proof. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then I’ll change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I knew you’d come up with a bald conclusion. But wait—who’s that waving to us? 
## ADRIANA and LUCIANA enter.
###ADRIANA
Yes, yes, Antipholus: look bewildered and frown at me. You’ve given away all your sweet looks to some other woman—I am not Adriana nor your wife. There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it. How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself? I say yourself because you are a stranger to me now, but when we are indivisible and united in one body, I am better than the best part of you. Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me! For you should know, my love, that it would be as easy to let a drop of water fall into the churning sea and then fish it out again, unmingled and undiminished, as it would be to take yourself from me without taking me out of myself as well. How deeply would it cut you if you heard that I had been cheating on you and that my body—which is sworn for you only—had been contaminated by vile lust? 
Wouldn’t you spit at me, and spurn me, and throw our marriage vows in my face? Wouldn’t you tear the mark off my whorish forehead, cut the wedding ring off my finger, and swear to divorce me? I know you would, so go ahead. For I have, in fact, committed adultery, and my blood has been contaminated by lust. Because if marriage has made us one, then when you cheat, you poison my flesh as well—your contagion makes me a prostitute. So stay faithful to me and return to your marriage bed.That way, my reputation will be protected and your honor will be intact. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Are you talking to me, fair woman? I don’t know you. I’ve only been in Ephesus for two hours. Your talk is as strange to me as your town. I’m trying with all my wits to figure out what you mean, but I can’t understand a word of it. 
###LUCIANA
Shame on you, brother-in-law! You’ve changed so much! Why are you treating my sister like this? She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Dromio? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Me? 
###ADRIANA
You. And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Did you talk with this woman? What kind of scheme do you have going together? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Me, sir? I never saw her till now. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You liar! You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I never talked with her in my life. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Then how does she know our names? By magic? 
###ADRIANA
How distasteful! That a man of your stature would scheme with his servant to upset me like this. It may be my fault that you’ve been avoiding me, but don’t make things worse by treating me with contempt as well. I’ll hang on your sleeve: you’re an elm tree, my husband, and I’m a vine. My weakness is enhanced by your strength, which gives me the strength to say this: the things that take you away from me are worthless—just overgrown weeds in need of a trimming. They get into your system and infect you, feeding off your confusion. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
She’s talking to me. She’s talking about me. What, was I married to her in a dream? Or am I asleep now and imagining all this? What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely? Until I know for sure, I’ll humor her. 
###LUCIANA
Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, I wish I had my rosary! I’ll cross myself. This must be some kind of fairyland. Oh, spite of spites! We’re 
speaking with goblins, owls, and demons. If we don’t obey them, they’ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue. 
###LUCIANA
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you? Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot! 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I’ve been transformed somehow, haven’t I, master? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I think your mind has been altered, and mine too. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, master, I’ve been changed in both mind and body. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your body looks the same. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, I’m an ape. 
###LUCIANA
If you’ve changed into anything, it’s an ass. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
That’s true. She’s riding me hard, and all I want to do is get out of here. I must be as stupid as an ass—that’s why I don’t know her, but she knows me. 
###ADRIANA
All right, all right. I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me. Come, husband, let’s go to lunch. Dromio, guard the door. Husband, I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled. Sirrah, if anyone asks where your master is, say he’s out to lunch, and don’t let anyone come in. Come, sister. Dromio, do a good job as doorkeeper. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell? Asleep or awake? Crazy or sane? These people know me, but I don’t 
know myself! I’ll agree with them and keep with it, whatever happens. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, should I watch the door? 
###ADRIANA
Yes, and don’t let anyone come in, or else I’ll break your head. 
###LUCIANA
Come come, Antipholus. We’re late for lunch. 
##They exit.
## ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS,ANGELO, and BALTHASAR enter.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Angelo, please excuse us. My wife gets angry when I’m late. Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow. But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house. You drunkard, what was that all about? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Say what you want, but I know what I know. You beat me at the marketplace, and I have the bruises to prove it. If my skin were paper and your punches were ink, you could read the beating on my body. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I think you’re an ass. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Honestly, it sure looks that way, judging by all the beatings and the bad treatment I’m getting. Since I’m an ass, I ought to kick like one. Then you’d be scared of me and keep away. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Balthasar, you look upset. I hope the good meal I’m going to give you will show the goodwill I bear you and how welcome you are. 
###BALTHASAR
Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Balthasar, all the welcome in the world can’t compare to a good meal, whatever kind of food it might be. 
###BALTHASAR
Good food’s not a big deal—everyone can afford that. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And everyone can say “welcome,” which is just a word. 
###BALTHASAR
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Sure, to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest. But look, even if my dishes are poor, eat them with my best wishes. You may come across better food, but not a warmer welcome. What’s this? My door is locked. (to DROMIO) Tell them to let us in. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn! 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Dope, moron, eunuch, fool, idiot, clown! Either get away from the door or sit yourself down there! What, are you trying to summon women with your spells—is that why you’re calling out so many names? Isn’t one enough for you? Get away with you! 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
What clown did they hire as the new doorkeeper? My master is standing out in the street! 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Then he should go back where he came from so he doesn’t catch a cold. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Who’s in there? Hey, open the door! 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Right. Give me one good reason and I will. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
A reason? So I can eat lunch. I haven’t eaten today. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) And you won’t eat here today. Come again some other time. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) I’m the doorkeeper for the moment, and my name is Dromio. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You jerk! You’ve stolen both my job and my name! True, the job never did me much good, and my name only ever got me in trouble. If you were the Dromio in my shoes today, you would have felt like you traded your head for a target and your name for the name of “Ass.” 
###
LUCEIn a later printing of the play, the character of Luce was renamed “Nell.”LUCE

(from offstage) What’s all the commotion, Dromio? Who’s at the door? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Luce, let my master in. 
###LUCE
(from offstage) No way, he’s too late. Tell your master that. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh! I’ll come at you with the old proverb: “Should I make myself at home?” 
###LUCE
(from offstage) I’ll come at you with another: “I’d like to see you try it!” 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) If your name’s Luce, then I say: Luce, good answer! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Listen up, you slave. Are you going to let us in? 
###LUCE
(from offstage) I was going to ask you that question. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) But you already answered no. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Come, help me bang on the door, master. Well done! We answered them, blow for blow. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You good-for-nothing, let me in. 
###LUCE
(from offstage) Says who? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, knock hard upon the door. 
###LUCE
(from offstage) He can knock till it hurts. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
If I break the door down, slave, you’ll be sorry for this. 
###LUCE
(from offstage) Why are we putting up with all this? The town’s got a pair of stocks. 
###ADRIANA
(from offstage) Who’s making such a ruckus at the door? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) I swear, this town’s plagued by troublesome boys. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Is that you, wife? You could have come sooner. 
###ADRIANA
(from offstage) Your wife, you scoundrel? Get away from the door. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
If she punishes you, master, she’s sure to punish me. 
###ANGELO
It looks like we’re not going to get food or welcome here. 
###BALTHASAR
We argued about which was best, and now we won’t get either one. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, your guests are just standing here. Tell them they’re welcome. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
There’s something strange in the air that’s keeping us from getting in. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And if your clothes were as thin as mine, you’d really feel the air. The food inside is warm, but you’re out here freezing. It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Go get me something I can use to break down the door. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Break anything here and I’ll break your head. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I’ll break words with you, sir. And since words are just wind, I’ll be breaking wind right in your face. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) It seems you’re the one who needs to be broken. Be off with you, you dog! 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I’ve had enough of this “off with you!” Come on, let me in! 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Of course—when birds have no feathers and fish have no fins. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Well, I’m going to break in. Go get me a crow. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
A crow without feathers? Master, do you really mean that? He said “when fish have no fins,” and you came back with a bird with no feathers. (to DROMIO OF SYRACUSE) If a crow gets us in, sirrah, then you and I will have a crow to pluck together. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I meant a crowbar. Get going already. 
###BALTHASAR
Be patient, sir! Don’t do this! This will hurt your reputation and make your wife, who’s innocent, look suspicious. Look, you’ve known her a long time. She’s wise, serious, mature, and modest. All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you. Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today. Listen to me. Be patient and leave, and we’ll all go to the Tiger for lunch. In the evening, come back alone and figure out this strange resistance. If you get violent and break in now, in broad daylight, people will talk about it. The common mob will presume things, and your untarnished reputation will be damaged—and that damage will last long after you’re dead. Slander passes from generation to generation, and once it sticks to a family, it’s there forever. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You’re right—I’ll go quietly. And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy. I know a terrific wench. She’s beautiful and charming—a little wild, but also gentle. We’ll eat at her place. My wife has accused me more than once of misbehaving with this woman. I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything. We’ll go to her place for lunch. (to ANGELO) Go get the necklace, which I’m sure is done by now. Bring it to the Porcupine, where this woman is. I’ll to give it to her, just to spite my wife. Hurry, good sir. Since my own doors refuse to admit me, I’ll knock somewhere else and see if they turn me away as well. 
###ANGELO
I’ll meet you there in an hour. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Do that. This little prank of hers is going to cost me. 
##They exit.
## LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE enter.
###LUCIANA
Have you completely forgotten your duty as a husband? Antipholus, your marriage is still fresh and new, like the springtime—have the young shoots of your love already started to wither? Is the building of your love already in ruins? If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness. Or if your affection has already strayed to another woman, at least be stealthy about it. Hide your false love, blindfold yourself so my sister cannot read your faithlessness in your eyes. Watch what you say, and don’t let your own words give away your shame. Look sweet and act kindly—be attractive in your disloyalty. Disguise your misbehavior as integrity, and behave properly even if your heart is tainted. Though you are sinful, carry yourself like a holy saint. Be false in secret: why does she need to know? What foolish thief brags about his crimes? It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes. When you do something shameful, it’s possible to put a good spin on it, but bad deeds are made worse by speaking of them. Alas, poor women! We’re so gullible, we believe it when you say you love us. Even if you love someone else in your heart, make it appear as if you love us. We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us. So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside. Comfort my sister, cheer her up, call her “wife.” It’s a holy thing to lie a little when sweet flattery can smooth over trouble. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as 
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine. Teach me how I should think and speak. My understanding is clumsy and human, riddled with errors—it is feeble, shallow, and weak. Reveal to me the hidden meaning of your words. Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction? Are you a god? Are you trying to remake me? Go ahead, I’ll yield to your power. But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife. I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to. Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears. Siren, use your song to make me love you instead, and I will obey. Spread your golden hair over the silver waves, and I will lie down in it like a bed. If a man could die in that glorious fantasy, then I think he would benefit by dying. Love is light and therefore floats—if my love is false, let me sink! 
###LUCIANA
Are you insane, talking like this? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Not insane, but amazed. I don’t know how. 
###LUCIANA
Your eyes are playing tricks on you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
That’s because you are near me, and you’re as dazzling as the sun. 
###LUCIANA
Train your eye on what you should be looking at, and you’ll see straight again. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sweet love, I’d rather close my eyes than look at darkness. 
###LUCIANA
Why are you calling me “love”? Call my sister that. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your sister’s sister. 
###LUCIANA
That’s my sister. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, it’s you: my better half. My eye’s clear vision, my heart’s most precious desire. My food, my fortune, my sweetest hope, my heaven on earth, and my entrance to heaven. 
###LUCIANA
My sister is all those things, or else she should be. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Call yourself your own sister, because I want you. I will love you, and with you I’ll spend my life. You have no husband yet, and I have no wife. Give me your hand. 
###LUCIANA
Oh, wait, sir. Stay here. I’ll go get my sister and see what she thinks. 
## LUCIANA exits.
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enters.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What’s going on, Dromio? Where are you running so fast? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Do you know me? Am I Dromio? Am I your servant? Am I myself? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You are Dromio, you are my servant, and you are yourself. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I’m an ass, I’m a woman’s servant, and I’m beside myself. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What woman’s servant? What do you mean, beside yourself? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I’ll tell you. Besides belonging to myself, I belong to a woman. A woman who says she owns me, who won’t leave me alone, and who wants me. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
How does she claim to own you? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The same way a person would claim to own his horse. And she wants me as a beast. I don’t mean that she wants me because I’m a beast, but that she, who is a beast, says I belong to her. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What’s she like? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
She has a very significant body. You couldn’t even talk about it without saying, “I beg your pardon.” My luck would be running thin if I ended up with her, although she’d make it a fat marriage. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What do you mean, a fat marriage? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Sir, she works in the kitchen, so she’s oily. The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by. Her 
clothes are so oily, they’d burn through the longest winter. Even if she lives till the end of the world, she’d keep burning an additional week. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What’s her skin like? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
It’s dark, like my shoe. But it’s not as clean. You’d be up to your ankles in how filthy it is. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Some water will fix that. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, it’s permanent. Noah’s flood wouldn’t be enough water to clean it. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What’s her name? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Nell. But an ell and three-quarters wouldn’t be long enough to measure her waist. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
So she’s wide? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Her hips are as wide as she is tall. She’s round, like a globe. I could use her like a map to find out where countries are. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What part of her body is Ireland? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Her bottom. It’s near the bogs. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Where’s Scotland? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
In the palm of her hand, which is covered in calluses. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Where’s France? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
In her forehead, which is enormous because of her receding hairline. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Where’s England? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I thought her teeth might be like the white cliffs, but they’re dark and stained. So I guess it’s her chin, which is separated from her forehead by all the sweat on her face. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Where’s Spain? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Honestly, I didn’t see it, but I felt it in her hot breath. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Where’s America and the West Indies? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sir, on her nose, which is covered with pimples, sores, and red welts. It points straight down at her mouth, which catches everything that drips from it. exotic jewels 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Where’s Belgium and the Netherlands ? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sir, I didn’t look down there. In conclusion, this witch said I was hers. She called me Dromio and swore I’d promised to marry her. She knew private things about my body, like the birthmark on my shoulder, the mole on my neck, and the huge wart on my left arm. I was terrified, and I ran away from her as if she were a witch. And I think that if I hadn’t been brave and strong, she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Get going—hustle over to the port. If there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight, I won’t spend tonight in this town. If a ship’s leaving, come to the marketplace. I’ll wait there for you. If everyone here knows us but we don’t know anybody, it’s time, I think, for us to pack our bags and take off. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I’ll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I’d run from a bear. 
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE exits.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Everyone who lives here is a witch. That means it’s high time for me to go. That woman who claims I am her husband—I loathe her in my soul. But her gorgeous sister, who’s so lovely and gracious, who’s so charming and who speaks so well, 
almost makes me want to stay here against my better judgment. I’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song. 
## ANGELO enters, with the necklace.
###ANGELO
Master Antipholus— 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Yes, that’s my name. 
###ANGELO
I know that, sir. Look, here’s the necklace. I was on my way to take it to you at the Porcupine, but it took a little longer to finish than I thought it would. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What do you want me to do with this? 
###ANGELO
Whatever you want—I made it for you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Made it for me? I didn’t order it. 
###ANGELO
You did—not just once or twice, but twenty times. Take it home and make your wife happy. I’ll come over at suppertime and you can pay me for it then. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You should take the money now. If you don’t, you might never see the money or the necklace ever again. 
###ANGELO
You’re a funny man, sir. Take care. 
## ANGELO exits.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I don’t know what to think about this. But what I do think is that nobody in his right mind would refuse to accept such a beautiful necklace when somebody offers it. I 
guess there’s no need to be a thief in Ephesus. People come up to you in the street and hand you gold. I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace. If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one. 
##He exits.
##The SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO,and an OFFICER enter.
###SECOND MERCHANT
You’ve owed me this money since the Pentecost holiday. I haven’t pressed you for it, and I wouldn’t now except that I’m going to Persia and I need money for the trip. So pay me now, or I’ll have this officer arrest you. 
###ANGELO
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you. Just before I ran into you, I gave him a necklace. At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it. Please, come to his house with me. I’ll pay what I owe you then and say thank you as well. 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS and DROMIO OF EPHESUS enter from the COURTESAN'S house.
###OFFICER
He saves you the trouble: look, here he comes. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to DROMIO) I’m going to the jeweler’s house. You go buy a piece of rope—I’ll whip my wife and her cohorts for locking me out of my own house. Wait a minute! I see the jeweler. Go, be gone with you. Buy a rope and bring it to me. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I buy myself a thousand beatings a year if I buy a rope. 
## DROMIO OF EPHESUS exits.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to ANGELO) Good luck to any man who trusts you. I swore that you would come with the necklace, but neither you nor the necklace showed up. Perhaps you were concerned about being chained to me and so decided not to come. 
###ANGELO
All joking aside, here’s an invoice spelling out exactly how many carats the necklace weighs as well as the quality of the gold and the workmanship. The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman. Please, pay him immediately. He’s about to leave on a trip and he’s waiting for the money. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I don’t have the cash right now. Besides, I have some business to take care of in town. Good signior, take this stranger to my house. Bring the necklace with you, and tell my wife to pay you the amount due. I might make it back in time to meet you. 
###ANGELO
So you’ll bring the necklace to her yourself? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
No. You bring it in case I can’t make it. 
###ANGELO
All right, sir, I will. Do you have it with you? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
If I don’t, I hope you do. Or else you’ll leave without your money. 
###ANGELO
Listen, please, give me the necklace. This gentleman’s ready to go. The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Good Lord! You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised. I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
It’s getting late. Please, sir, hurry up. 
###ANGELO
Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me. Give me the necklace! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Give it to my wife, and get your money. 
###ANGELO
Come, come. You know I gave it to you just now. Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Damn it, this isn’t funny. Where’s the necklace? Let me see it. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
My business cannot wait for this delay. (to ANTIPHOLUS) Good sir, tell me if you’re going to pay me. If not, I’ll turn this man over to the officer. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Pay you? What should I pay you? 
###ANGELO
The money you owe me for the necklace. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace. 
###ANGELO
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You gave me nothing, and you wrong me by saying you did. 
###ANGELO
You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it. Consider how poorly this reflects on me. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
Well, officer, I charge you to arrest him. 
###OFFICER
I will. (to ANGELO) And I order you to obey me, in the name of the duke. 
###ANGELO
This harms my reputation. Either pay this sum, Antipholus, or I’ll have this officer arrest you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Pay for something I never got? Go ahead, you fool. Arrest me if you dare. 
###ANGELO
Officer, here’s your fee—arrest him. I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly. 
###OFFICER
You’re under arrest, sir. You hear the charges. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I’ll obey you until I can make bail. But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop. 
###ANGELO
Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed. I’m certain of it. 
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enters.
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, there’s a ship from Epidamnum that’s going to set sail as soon as its owner gets on board. I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted. The ship is ready, the wind is up, and the sailors are only waiting for their owner and for you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
What are you, a madman? You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped. You sent me to the port to find a ship. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully. Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly. Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry. Have her send it to me. Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail. Hurry, you slave! Go! Officer, take me to prison until the money comes. 
## SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, OFFICER, and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS exit.
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
To Adriana? That’s where we had lunch. Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband! She’s too much for me to handle. But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters' wishes. 
##He exits.
## ADRIANA and LUCIANA enter.
###ADRIANA
Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that? Could you tell from his face if he was serious? Yes or no? Did he look flushed or pale? Sad or happy? Could you tell from his looks what he was feeling in his heart? 
###LUCIANA
First, he said you had no right to him. 
###ADRIANA
He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately. 
###LUCIANA
Then he swore he was a stranger here. 
###ADRIANA
And that’s true—he is being strange. And yet he lies as well, for he’s no stranger. 
###LUCIANA
Then I pleaded for you. 
###ADRIANA
And what did he say? 
###LUCIANA
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you. 
###ADRIANA
How did he try to persuade you to love him? 
###LUCIANA
With words that—if they were spoken honestly—might have moved me. First, he praised my beauty, then my eloquence. 
###ADRIANA
Did you praise him as well? 
###LUCIANA
Have some patience, please. 
###ADRIANA
I cannot and I will not keep quiet. My voice will have its way, even if my heart can’t. He is misshapen, crooked, old, and withered. His face is ugly, and his body is even worse—all shapeless, everywhere. He is vicious, mean, foolish, blunt, unkind. His body is deformed, and his mind is worse. 
###LUCIANA
Then why be jealous of a person like that? When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries. 
###ADRIANA
Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes. I’m like a lapwing, creating a diversion in order to distract predators from my nest. My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him. 
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enters, running.
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Here! Go! The desk! Money! Come on, now! Hurry! 
###LUCIANA
How did you lose your breath? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
By running fast. 
###ADRIANA
Where’s your master, Dromio? Is he all right? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, he’s in a place worse than hell. A devil in a tough uniform has him—a man whose heart is as hard as steel. A fiend and a goblin, pitiless and rough. A wolf—no, even worse—a man all in tough leather. A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways. A hunting dog that runs in 
the opposite direction of its prey, yet can follow the scent of the hunt. A man who puts people away before the verdict is announced. 
###ADRIANA
Speak, man, what’s the matter? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I don’t know what the matter is, but he’s been arrested for it. 
###ADRIANA
What? He’s been arrested? Tell me, who had him arrested? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I don’t know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather. Mistress, will you send him bail? The money in the desk? 
###ADRIANA
Get it, sister. 
## LUCIANA exits.
I don’t understand it. How could he be in debt without me knowing it? Tell me, was he arrested because of a band ? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not for a band, but for something stronger: a necklace, a necklace! Don’t you hear it ring? 
###ADRIANA
What, the necklace? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, no, the bell. It’s time for me to go. It was two o'clock when I left him, and now it’s one. 
###ADRIANA
Time’s running backward? I’ve never heard of that. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sure. When an hour meets a cop, it turns and runs in fear. 
###ADRIANA
Time’s not the one in debt. Your logic is so foolish. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Time is always bankrupt: it owes more than it can ever pay back in a season. And Time’s a thief, too—don’t you know the old saying, “Time steals along”? So if Time is in debt and also a thief, and a cop comes, don’t you think Time would turn back an hour? 
## LUCIANA returns with a purse full of money.
###ADRIANA
Here’s the money, Dromio. Take it to your master and bring him home immediately. Come, sister, my imagination is too much for me: it both comforts me and depresses me. 
##They exit.
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE enters.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name. Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them, some try to sell me things. Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements. These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians. 
## DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enters.
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Here’s the money you wanted, master. Hey, have you gotten rid of that Adam? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What gold is this? Who’s this Adam you speak of? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse. The one that wears leather clothes. The one that grabbed you and arrested you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I don’t know what you’re talking about. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No? It’s plain enough. The Adam who looks like a cello, in a big leather case. The one who gives tired people “arrest.” The one who gives ruined men new suits—law suits. The one who’s determined to do more damage with his nightstick than a soldier does with his pike. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You mean an officer? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, the leader of the team; the one that gets you if you can’t pay a debt; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them, “Have arrest.” 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, stop your joking there. Are any ships leaving tonight? Can we go? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship Expedition was leaving tonight, but then the officer got you, and you decided to wait for the little rowboat Delay. Here’s the bail money you sent me to get. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
This fellow’s gone mad, and so have I. We’re in some kind of dream world. Please, somebody, get us out of here! 
##A COURTESAN enters.
###COURTESAN
Good to see you, Master Antipholus. I see you’ve met with the jeweler. Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Get away from me, Satan! Don’t try to tempt me! 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, is this Satan’s mistress? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
She’s the devil. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench. And that’s why some women say, “God damn me,” which is the same thing as saying, “God make me an easy wench.” The Bible says the devil looks like an angel of light. But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you. In other words, easy wenches will burn you. Keep away from this one. 
###COURTESAN
You and your servant are very funny, sir. Will you come with me? Can we finish our lunch? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why, Dromio? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because of the old saying: “He who eats with the devil needs a very long spoon.” You need to keep far away from them. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
(to COURTESAN) Get away, you demon! You talk about eating? You’re a sorceress, like everyone else here. I’ll conjure you, like a spell: get away from me. 
###COURTESAN
Give me back the ring I gave you at lunch, or give me the necklace you promised in exchange. Then I’ll be gone, sir, and stop troubling you. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Some devils ask for nothing more than nail clippings, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, or a cherry pit. But this one’s greedy: she wants a necklace. Be wise, master. If you give it to her, she’ll shake the chain and frighten us, like the angel in the Bible. 
###COURTESAN
Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace. I hope you’re not trying to cheat me. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Be gone, witch! Come, Dromio, let’s go. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Accusing us of cheating is like the proud peacock accusing someone else of pride. Mistress, you know about that. 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE exit.
###COURTESAN
Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it. If not, he’d never behave like this. He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it. Now he won’t give me either. The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house. His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having. I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring. It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats. 
##She exits.
## ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS enters with the OFFICER. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape. When it’s time for me to be freed, I’ll pay you the fee you’re entitled to for arresting me. My wife’s in a perverse mood today. She’ll be suspicious when the messenger tells her that I was arrested. I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it. 
## DROMIO OF EPHESUS enters, holding a length of rope.
Here’s my servant. I think he’s got the money. Hello there, sir! Do you have what I told you to get? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Yes. And this rope will take care of everybody, I guarantee it. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
But where’s the money? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I spent it on this rope. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You idiot! Five hundred ducats for a rope? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Why did I just send you home? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
To get a piece of rope. And here I am, with that piece. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with. (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS) 
###OFFICER
Good sir, calm down. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You should tell me to calm down—I’m the one who’s suffering here. 
###OFFICER
Hold your tongue. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, you should tell him to hold his hands! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You son of a bitch, senseless villain! 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears. I’ve served this man from the moment I was born until this very instant, and all I’ve ever gotten from him are bruises. When I’m cold, his beatings keep me warm. When I’m hot, they keep me cool. He wakes me up by beating me, makes me stand by beating me, sends me out of the house and welcomes me back by beating me. Seriously, I carry beatings around with me like a beggar woman carries her baby. I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
That’s enough. My wife’s coming. 
## ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTESAN, and PINCH, a schoolmaster, enter.
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death! Or as the parrot says: “Beware of the rope’s end,” and watch out for a hanging. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Are you going to keep talking? (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS) 
###COURTESAN
Now what do you think? Your husband’s mad, isn’t he? 
###ADRIANA
This terrible behavior proves it. Doctor Pinch, you’re an exorcist. If you can bring him back to his senses, I’ll pay you whatever you demand. 
###LUCIANA
Alas, how passionate and angry he looks! 
###COURTESAN
Look! He’s trembling in his fit! 
###PINCH
Give me your hand. Let me take your pulse. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Here’s my hand. Let it feel your ear. (he strikes PINCH) 
###PINCH
Satan! You are living inside this man! I order you to release him through my prayers and to return immediately to the darkness you came from. I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Shut up, you doddering old wizard! I’m not possessed! 
###ADRIANA
Oh, I wish you weren’t, you poor, frightened soul. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers? Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house? 
###ADRIANA
Oh, husband, God himself knows you ate at home. I wish you had stayed there, avoiding these scandals and this public embarrassment! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Ate at home? You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I swear, sir, you did not eat at home. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
My doors were locked and I was shut out, right? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And she screamed at me, right? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No lie—she screamed at you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
She sure did. The kitchen girl mocked you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And I departed in a rage, right? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You truly did. My body can prove it because it felt the power of your anger. 
###ADRIANA
(to PINCH) Should I try to soothe him by pretending to agree with his lies? 
###PINCH
Good idea. His servant here has figured out that agreeing is a good way to cope with his anger. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to ADRIANA) You convinced the jeweler to arrest me. 
###ADRIANA
For goodness sake, I sent money to bail you out. I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You gave money to me? She might have given me her best wishes, master, but she didn’t give me one scrap of money. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats? 
###ADRIANA
He did, and I gave it to him. 
###LUCIANA
And I saw her do it. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I was sent for a rope! God and the rope maker are my witnesses! 
###PINCH
Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed. I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look. We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to ADRIANA) Tell me! Why did you lock me out today? (to DROMIO OF EPHESUS) And why are you denying that you received the gold? 
###ADRIANA
My sweet husband, I did not lock you out. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And my sweet master, I received no gold. But I agree, sir, that we were locked out. 
###ADRIANA
You lying villain! Both those statements are false. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You lying slut, everything you say is false. You’re scheming with some damned gang, trying to make a fool of me. With my own bare hands, I’ll scratch out your eyes, which want to see me humiliated. 
##Three or four men enter and try to restrain ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. He struggles with them.
###ADRIANA
Tie him up! Tie him up! Keep him away from me! 
###PINCH
We need more help! The devil in him is strong! 
###LUCIANA
Oh, my, poor man! How pale and listless he looks! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Are you trying to kill me? jailer, i’m your prisoner. are you going to let them break me out of jail? 
###OFFICER
Gentlemen, let go of him. He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him. 
###PINCH
Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well. 
##The men tie up DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
###ADRIANA
What are you doing, you stupid officer? Do you take some kind of pleasure in seeing a sick man harm himself? 
###OFFICER
He’s my prisoner. If I let him go, I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself. 
###ADRIANA
I’ll pay you. Take me to the man my husband is in debt to. Once I find out what the debt is for, I’ll pay it. Doctor Pinch, please have him brought to my house. What a horrible day! 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
What a horrible slut! 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, I’m all tied up for you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Shut up already, you scoundrel! Why are you trying to provoke me? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You’d rather be tied up for nothing? Act insane, good master: scream out, “The devil!” 
###LUCIANA
Oh my God! The poor souls—how strangely they talk! 
###ADRIANA
Get him out of here. Sister, come with me. 
## PINCH and the men lead ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS and DROMIO OF EPHESUS offstage.
##The OFFICER, ADRIANA, LUCIANA, and the COURTESAN remain onstage.
Now tell me. Who had him arrested? 
###OFFICER
Angelo, the jeweler. Do you know him? 
###ADRIANA
I know him. How much does my husband owe? 
###OFFICER
Two hundred ducats. 
###ADRIANA
For what? 
###OFFICER
For a necklace your husband had him make. 
###ADRIANA
He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it. 
###COURTESAN
Today your husband came to my place, completely furious. He took my ring, which I just saw on his finger, by the way. Right after that, I saw him with a necklace. 
###ADRIANA
Maybe so, but I never saw it. Jailer, bring me to the jeweler. I need to hear the truth about all this. 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE enters with his sword drawn, followed by DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
###LUCIANA
God have mercy on us! They broke loose! 
###ADRIANA
And they’ve got their swords unsheathed! Let’s call for help and get them tied up again! 
###OFFICER
Let’s get out of here! They’ll kill us! 
##Frightened, ADRIANA, LUCIANA,the OFFICER, and the COURTESAN run offstage as fast as they can.
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
It looks like these witches are scared of swords. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Go to the Centaur and get our stuff. I wish we were safely on board our ship already. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Look, let’s stay here tonight. Nobody will hurt us. You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold. I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for 
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me, I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town. Go and get our stuff onto the ship. 
##They exit.
##The SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO enter.
###ANGELO
I’m sorry that I delayed you, sir. But even though he denies it, I swear he got the necklace from me. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city? 
###ANGELO
People think very highly of him. The merchants give him unlimited credit. He’s well beloved, second to none in the city. I’d trust him with everything I own. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
Speak more quietly: I think he’s coming this way. 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE enter.
###ANGELO
You’re right. And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have! Good sir, stay close to me. I’ll speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I can’t believe you’d put me to this kind of shame and trouble—not to mention the scandal you’ve brought on yourself. You swore I never gave you the necklace, but now you’re wearing it openly. Not only has your lie cost you money, shame, and imprisonment, but you’ve also mistreated this honest friend of mine. If it hadn’t been for this dispute, he would have already hoisted sail and left for sea. You got that necklace from me: can you deny that? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I got it from you—I never said I didn’t. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
Yes, you did, sir. In fact, you swore it. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Who heard me do that? 
###SECOND MERCHANT
My own ears heard it, and you know it. To hell with you! It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You’re a villain to say this about me. I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
I do dare, and I say that you are the villain. 
##They draw their swords. ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTESAN, and others enter.
###ADRIANA
(to SECOND MERCHANT) Wait! Don’t hurt him, for God’s sake! He’s crazy! Somebody approach him and take away his sword. Tie up Dromio, too, and take them to my house. 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Run, master, run. For God’s sake, find a house to duck into. This looks like an abbey. Go in, or we’re done for. 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE exit into the abbey.
##The ABBESS enters.
###ABBESS
Be quiet, people! Why have you come here in such a mob? 
###ADRIANA
To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there. Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover. 
###ANGELO
(to SECOND MERCHANT) I knew he wasn’t quite in his right mind. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
(to ANGELO) Now I’m sorry I raised my sword against him. 
###ABBESS
How long has he been possessed like this? 
###ADRIANA
This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self. But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence. 
###ABBESS
Did he lose a lot of money in a shipwreck? Has a close friend of his died? Has he fallen in love with another woman? That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander. Which of these bad things happened to him? 
###ADRIANA
None of them, except the last one. He fell in love, and that made him leave home often. 
###ABBESS
You should have reprimanded him for that. 
###ADRIANA
I did. 
###ABBESS
Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough. 
###ADRIANA
I was as harsh as I could be while still being a lady. 
###ABBESS
You scolded him in private? 
###ADRIANA
And in public too. 
###ABBESS
Fine, but not enough. 
###ADRIANA
It was all we talked about. I kept him awake at night talking about it. He couldn’t eat without me talking about it. When we were alone, it was the only thing I talked about, and when we were with other people, I often found a way to mention it. All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was. 
###ABBESS
And that’s why he went crazy. A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog. You disturbed his sleep with your complaining, which is why he’s disoriented. You seasoned his food with screams. Stress during mealtime ruins the digestion, and that gave him a raging fever. Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness. You spoiled his fun by fighting with him, and when people can’t enjoy themselves, they grow moody and dull with melancholy—they come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed. Next thing you know, all kinds of terrible illnesses break out. Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad. What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity. 
###LUCIANA
She was always gentle when she scolded him, even when he behaved in the worst and wildest ways. (to ADRIANA) Why won’t you defend yourself against this woman? 
###ADRIANA
She has tricked me into seeing my own faults. Gentlemen, go in there and grab him. 
###ABBESS
Nobody goes into my house! 
###ADRIANA
Then have your servants bring him out. 
###ABBESS
No: he came here for sanctuary, and that will protect him from you. I’ll try to bring him back to his right mind and work to the end of my abilities to do so. 
###ADRIANA
It’s my place to take care of my husband and nurse him back to health. It is my duty and mine alone. So let me take him home. 
###ABBESS
Be patient. I’m not going to let him leave until I’ve tried every means to cure him. With my healthful potions, drugs, and holy prayers, I’ll make him a complete man again. Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs. Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me. 
###ADRIANA
I will not depart and leave my husband here. It doesn’t suit your holiness to separate a husband and his wife. 
###ABBESS
Be quiet and depart. You’re not going to take him. 
##The ABBESS exits.
###LUCIANA
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke. 
###ADRIANA
Come with me. I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
It’s almost five o'clock. The duke will pass by here soon. He always passes here on his way to that melancholy place where criminals are put to death. It’s just behind this abbey. 
###ANGELO
Why is he going there today? 
###SECOND MERCHANT
To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus. 
###ANGELO
Here they come. We will watch the execution. 
###LUCIANA
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey. 
##The DUKE enters with EGEON, who is bareheaded. The executioner and other officers follow.
###DUKE
One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death. This is how well we regard him. 
###ADRIANA
Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice. 
###DUKE
She’s a virtuous and holy lady. She can’t possibly have done you any wrong. 
###ADRIANA
Your Highness, you were the one who introduced me to my husband, Antipholus, and suggested I marry him. On this terrible day, a most outrageous fit of madness possessed him. It made him run desperately through the streets with his servant, who is just as mad. He angered all the citizens by rushing into their houses and taking rings, jewels, and anything else he felt like. At one point I managed to get him tied up and sent home so that I could make some order out of all the trouble he caused. But somehow, he broke free from his guards. Then he and his crazy servant found us and chased us away with swords. We got more help and came back to capture them, but then they fled into this abbey. We tried to go in, but the abbess stopped us. She wouldn’t let us get him and she wouldn’t send him out. So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help. 
###DUKE
A long time ago your husband was a soldier in the wars I led. And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him. 
(to his followers) Go, knock on the gate and bid the abbess come out here and speak to me. I’ll settle this before I go 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Mistress! Run and save yourself. My master and his servant broke loose. They’ve beaten the maids and tied up Doctor Pinch. Then they set fire to his beard and threw sewage to put out the flames. My master keeps telling the doctor to relax, while his servant cuts the doctor’s hair in a ridiculous fashion. If you don’t send some help, they’ll kill Doctor Pinch. 
###ADRIANA
Shut up, fool! Your master and his servant are here. You’re telling a lie. 
###MESSENGER
Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true. It was just moments ago. He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you. 
##Shouts are heard from offstage.
Listen, listen! I hear him, mistress. Run, get out of here! 
###DUKE
(to ADRIANA) Stand with me. Don’t be scared. (to his men) Guards, get your weapons! 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS and DROMIO OF EPHESUS enter.
###ADRIANA
Oh, my, it’s my husband. Look, he can become invisible. Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there. It’s impossible to understand. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Justice, gracious duke. Please bring me justice! A long time ago I did good service to you. I fought in your wars and took deep wounds to save your life. In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now. 
###EGEON
(to himself) The fear of death might be making me senile, but I think I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Sweet prince, I want justice from that woman there. This woman that you urged me to marry has abused me and dishonored me, doing the most injury possible. The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination. 
###DUKE
Tell me the details. You know I’ll be fair. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores. 
###DUKE
That’s terrible! (to ADRIANA) Tell us, woman, did you do that? 
###ADRIANA
No, my good lord. I ate with him and my sister. Damn my soul if these accusations are true! 
###LUCIANA
If she’s lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day. 
###ANGELO
Oh, lying woman! Both of them are liars: the madman accuses them justly. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
My lord, I know what I’m saying. I’m not drunk, and I haven’t gone mad from anger—even though the wrongs done to me today would drive any man insane. This woman locked me out of the house today at lunchtime, and if he weren’t conspiring with her, this jeweler could confirm my story since he was with me at the time. He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar. He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him. I met him in the street—he was there with that man. (points to the SECOND MERCHANT) That’s when this lying jeweler swore that he had already given me the necklace, which, God knows, he hadn’t. He had me arrested for it, and I went with the officer, sending my servant home to get money for the bail. When my servant returned empty-handed, I politely asked the officer to accompany me to my house. On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates. One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse. He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse. Then, with his thin face leering down at mine, he cried out that I was possessed. 
Then they all pounced on me, tied me up, carried me away, and left me in a dark, dank cellar in my house. They left me and my servant there, tied together. Eventually I chewed through the ropes and freed myself, and I immediately ran to find you, Your Grace. I beg you: grant me justice for the deep shame I have suffered and the terrible wrongs done to me. 
###ANGELO
Your Highness, I can confirm this much: he was locked out of his house and didn’t eat at home. 
###DUKE
But did he receive a necklace from you? 
###ANGELO
He did, my lord. And when he ran in here, everyone could see that he was wearing that necklace. 
###SECOND MERCHANT
Besides, I’ll swear I heard you confess that you did receive the necklace, even after you swore at the marketplace that you hadn’t. That’s when I raised my sword against you, and you fled into this abbey—which, I think, you must have escaped from through some kind of trick. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I was never inside this abbey, and you never raised your sword against me. I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven! Everything you charge me with is untrue. 
###DUKE
Why, what a complicated case this is! I think you all must have drunk some kind of potion that’s turned you all into animals. (to ADRIANA) If you put him in the abbey, that’s where he’d be. If he were insane, he wouldn’t be pleading his case so sensibly. You say he 
ate at home, but the jeweler says he didn’t. Sirrah, what do you have to say? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine. 
###COURTESAN
He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
That’s true, my lord: I did get this ring from her. 
###DUKE
Did you see him enter this abbey? 
###COURTESAN
As clearly as I see you, my lord. 
###DUKE
This is very odd. Get the abbess out here. I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad. 
##Someone exits to get the ABBESS 
###EGEON
Mighty duke, please allow me to say something. I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life. 
###DUKE
Feel free to say what you wish, Syracusian. 
###EGEON
(to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS) Isn’t your name Antipholus? And isn’t that Dromio, the man bound to you? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes. Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him. 
###EGEON
I’m sure you both remember me. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Actually, it’s ourselves you bring to mind since just a few moments ago we were tied up, as you are now. You’re not one of Pinch’s patients, are you, sir? 
###EGEON
Why are you looking at me so strangely? You know me well. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I never saw you before in my life. 
###EGEON
Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me. Time has the power to deform people, and the sorrowful hours I have spent in his company have put these strange lines and wrinkles on my face. But tell me this: don’t you know my voice? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
No. 
###EGEON
Don’t you, Dromio? 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No sir, trust me, I do not. 
###EGEON
I am sure you do. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Fine, sir, but I’m sure I don’t. And you’re in no position to doubt my word. 
###EGEON
You don’t know my voice? Oh, severe Time! Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice? It’s true: this aged face of mine is hidden by a snow white beard, and the blood is freezing in my veins. But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little. All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I never saw my father in my life. 
###EGEON
You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse. Maybe you’re ashamed to admit that you know me because I’m a prisoner now. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
The duke and everyone who knows me in this city can confirm that’s not true. I’ve never been to Syracuse in my life. 
###DUKE
I tell you, Syracusian. I’ve been looking after Antipholus for twenty years, and during that time he’s never been to Syracuse. Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things. 
##The ABBESS enters, along with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
###ABBESS
Mighty duke, look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly! 
##Everyone gathers around to look.
###ADRIANA
Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands. 
###DUKE
(looks at the ANTIPHOLUS twins) One of these men is the other’s genius. (looks at the DROMIO twins) And the same with these two. But which is the man and which is the spirit? Can anyone tell? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I, sir, am Dromio. Command this man to leave. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You are Egeon, aren’t you? Or are you his ghost? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up? 
###ABBESS
Whoever tied him up, I will loosen the ropes, and with his freedom I will gain a husband. Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons? Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia! 
###DUKE
Why, now the story the merchant told me this morning is starting to make sense. These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident. 
###EGEON
If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia. If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft. 
###ABBESS
Some men from Epidamnum rescued me, our son, and Dromio. But then a gang of violent fishermen from Corinth kidnapped Dromio and my son and carried them away. I don’t know what became of them. You can see what became of me. 
###DUKE
Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, sir. I came from Syracuse. 
###DUKE
Wait, don’t stand next to each other. I can’t tell who’s who. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I came from Corinth, Your Highness. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And I came with him. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here. 
###ADRIANA
Which of you two ate lunch with me today? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I did, kind lady. 
###ADRIANA
And you’re my husband, right? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
No, he’s not. I say no to that. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
So do I, although she called me her husband. And this beautiful gentlewoman, her sister, called me brother. (to LUCIANA) If all this is for real, I hope I’ll get the chance to make good on all the things I said to you today. 
###ANGELO
That’s the necklace I gave you, sir. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I think it is, sir. I don’t deny it. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace. 
###ANGELO
I think I did, sir. I don’t deny it. 
###ADRIANA
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I don’t think he brought it to you. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, he didn’t get any by me. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me. It seems that we kept running into each other’s servants all day. And everyone thought I was him, and he was me, and that’s how all these errors came about. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I want to use this money to set my father free. 
###DUKE
That’s not necessary. I’m going to let him live. 
###COURTESAN
Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me. 
###ABBESS
Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us. Everyone assembled here who has been troubled by the day’s events join us as well, and we will straighten everything out. My sons, waiting to hear news of you has been like a second childbirth: this time, my labor lasted thirty-three years, and I am only now delivered of my heavy burden. Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening. After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration! 
###DUKE
With all my heart, I’ll join you. 
##Everyone exits, except for the DROMIO twins and the ANTIPHOLUS twins.
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS) Master, should I go get your luggage off the ship? 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Dromio, what stuff of mine did you put on a ship? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir. 
###ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
He means me. I’m your master, Dromio. Come inside with us: we’ll deal with that later. Embrace your brother there, and rejoice with him. 
## ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS exit.
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
You have a fat friend at your master’s house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you. I guess now she’s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I think you’re my mirror, not my brother. And I can see by looking at you that I’m a pretty good-looking fellow. Do you want to go in and join the party? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
After you, sir. You’re older than me. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
That’s a good point. How can we tell which of us is the oldest? 
###DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
We’ll draw straws. Meanwhile, after you. 
###DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, I’ll tell you what. We came into the world as brother and brother, so now let’s enter hand in hand—not one before the other. 
##They exit

##London. King Richard II’s palace.
## KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, and other nobles and attendants enter. 
###KING RICHARD II
Old John of Gaunt, did you do as you promised and bring your brave son Henry here? I’d like to hear the violent accusation he wanted to make against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, which I didn’t have time for earlier. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
I’ve brought him, my lord. 
###KING RICHARD II
Have you asked him if the source of his complaint is an old feud, or if he knows of some treason the duke has committed? 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
As far as I could tell, it’s not some personal malice. My son believes that the duke means to harm you in some way. 
###KING RICHARD II
Then call them both in to see me. I want to hear in person what each has to say. They’re both so proud and full of anger that they act recklessly and don’t listen to reason. 
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY enter. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
May you have many years of happiness, my gracious and loving lord. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
May each day be happier than the last, and heaven give you immortality! 
###KING RICHARD II
Thank you both. But I know one of you isn’t sincere since each of you accuses the other of treason against me. Henry of Hereford, what do you have to say against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
First, may heaven be my witness! I’ve come here as an accuser because I am a devoted subject who cares for the safety of my prince, not because of any other prejudice against the duke. Now, Thomas Mowbray, I will turn to you. Pay attention to this. I will prove that what I am about to say is true, either with my body here on earth or with my immortal soul in heaven. You are a traitor and a villain, born into too good a family to be so and too bad to live. The more beautiful the sky, the uglier the clouds look. Once more, to emphasize my accusation, I call you a traitor. And with my king’s permission, I’d like to follow what I say with my sword. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
Don’t let my calm words cast doubt on my loyalty. I know that angry words will not settle this argument, so I’ll try to keep myself under control. But I can’t be so calm as to not say anything in my own defense. First, my respect for you, my king, prevents me from saying what I want and throwing those charges of treason right back at Bolingbroke. I defy him and spit on him as if he weren’t your relative, my lord. He’s a trash-talking coward and a villain, and I’d back up those charges in a duel, even if I gave him an advantage by handicapping myself. For now, I’ve defended my loyalty and made it known that he lies. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
You pale coward. There I’ll throw my glove in challenge to you and set aside my relationship to the king and my royal blood. It’s fear—not respect for the king’s bloodline—that keeps you quiet. If your guilt has given you the guts to accept my challenge, then pick up my glove. I’ll show your cowardice and treason by defeating you in knightly combat. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
I’ll take that challenge. And I promise, by my knighthood, that I’ll fight you fairly in whatever contest you wish. And when I mount my horse, let me not dismount alive if I’m a traitor or if I cheat in any way! 
###KING RICHARD II
What do you accuse Mowbray of, my cousin? It will have to be something terrible if it’s going to make me think badly of him in any way. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I’ll prove with my life that what I say is true. Mowbray has received eight thousand gold coins that he was supposed to pay to your soldiers as advances on their wages. But he’s used the money improperly, just like a traitor and harmful villain would. Even more, I declare and will prove in battle that all treasonous plots over the past eighteen years originated with Mowbray. And further, I know that he caused the death of the Duke of Gloucester by encouraging the duke’s easily influenced enemies, like any coward would, to slay the innocent duke. The duke was murdered like Abel, and his blood demands that I seek revenge and justice. By my own good name, I’ll inflict that justice on Mowbray or die trying. 
###KING RICHARD II
He is so determined! Thomas, how do you respond? 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
I wish you would turn away and not listen till I’ve told this fellow, who disgraces his bloodline, how much God and good men hate liars like him. 
###KING RICHARD II
Mowbray, my eyes and ears are impartial, even if he were my brother, or even my heir, rather than just my cousin. I vow on my scepter that his relation to me doesn’t give him any advantage or prejudice me in his favor. He’s my subject, Mowbray, and so are you, so speak freely and without fear. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
Then, Bolingbroke, you lie from your heart up through your false throat. I gave three quarters of the money I received to the king’s soldiers. The other quarter I had permission to keep, because I was owed the money for my service in going to fetch the queen from France. Now take back your lie. As for Gloucester, I didn’t kill him, but I admit I disgracefully neglected my duty. I once laid in wait to kill you, my noble lord of Lancaster, the father of my enemy. It was a terrible sin and troubles me greatly. But I confessed it already and specifically begged your pardon, and I hoped you had forgiven me. That is my fault. As for the rest of the charges, they come from a villain’s evil nature, and I’ll defend myself against this faithless and cowardly traitor. I’ll throw my glove down onto this arrogant traitor’s foot, and I’ll show that I’m loyal even compared to this member of the royal bloodline. I therefore pray that your highness will assign a day for our duel soon. 
###KING RICHARD II
Obey what I say, my hot-headed gentlemen. Let’s settle this feud without violence. Such fierce anger causes too great an injury. Forget it and forgive each other. Come to terms and agree to put this to an end. The astrologers have said that this is no month to shed blood. Good uncle, let’s end this now. I’ll calm down the Duke of Norfolk. You calm down your son. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
For someone my age it is appropriate to make peace. My son, throw down the Duke of Norfolk’s glove. 
###KING RICHARD II
And Norfolk, throw down his. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Come on, Henry, when are you going to do it? I shouldn’t have to ask you again. 
###KING RICHARD II
Throw it down, Norfolk, I’m telling you. There is no advantage in refusing. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
I’ll throw myself at your feet, most revered king. You may command my life but not my shame. I owe you my life out of duty, but I cannot, even under pain of death, let you order this dishonor of my good reputation. I am accused and disgraced publicly here, pierced by the venom of slander. The only thing that will ease that pain is to kill the man who uttered these poisonous words. 
###KING RICHARD II
Such rage should be resisted. Give me his glove. I, as king, will tame these lesser nobles. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
Yes, but you won’t take away the stain of these charges. If you’ll clear my name, I’ll give up my glove. My dear, dear lord, the greatest treasure in our earthly lives is to have a good reputation. Without that, men are nothing. To have a brave spirit is as valuable as a well-guarded jewel. My honor is my life. One is inseparable from the other. Take my honor, and my life is over. So, my lord, let me prove my honor, since I live for it and I will die for it. 
###KING RICHARD II
Cousin, take up your glove. Be the one to start. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Oh, God, keep me from such a terrible sin! Should I appear humbled in front of my father? Or discredit my rank out of fear before this terrified coward? Before I’d let my tongue utter such lies against my honor or make such a false truce, I’d rip it apart with my teeth and spit it into Mowbray’s shameful face. 
## JOHN OF GAUNT exits.
###KING RICHARD II
I was born to command, not to beg. But since I can’t order you to be friends, be ready to settle this feud with your lives at Coventry on Saint Lambert’s day. Then you can let your weapons resolve this hatred, since I can’t bring you to terms. Justice will be on the side of the winner. Lord marshal, tell my officers to be ready to control these domestic disturbances. 
##Everyone exits. 
##The Duke of Lancaster’s palace.
## JOHN OF GAUNT and the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER enter. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Even more than your uproar, it’s the fact that the Duke of Gloucester was my brother that makes me want to act against his murderers. But since it was Richard who was responsible for the murder in the first place and also controls how it will be avenged, I’ll have to trust in the will of heaven to bring justice to my brother’s killers. 
###DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER
Don’t you feel compelled to do more since he was your brother? Is there no passion in your love for him? Your father Edward treasured you and your six brothers. Some of you died natural deaths, and some of your lives were cut short. But Thomas, who was my love and one of Edward’s precious sons, is dead, killed by people who hated him. Oh, Gaunt, he was your own blood! The same mother and father who made you made him, and though you live and breathe, a part of you died with him. And because your father was the model for him, by watching him die you have in a sense consented to see your father die. You aren’t being patient. You’re giving up. In allowing your brother to be murdered, you have shown how you yourself might be killed. What we might call patience in common men is simply cowardice in noble men. What else can I say? The best way to protect your own life is to get revenge for Gloucester’s death. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
It’s God’s quarrel now, because it was his chosen king, who serves as God’s deputy on earth, who caused Gloucester’s death. If it was a crime, let heaven punish it, because I won’t raise a hand against God’s minister. 
###DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER
Whom should I complain to then? 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
To God, who defends widows. 
###DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER
Why then, I will. Goodbye, old Gaunt. You are going to Coventry to see our kinsman Hereford and ruthless Mowbray fight. I hope that the weight of the crime against my husband will give force to Hereford’s spear, letting it pierce the killer Mowbray’s breast! Or, if he misses in the first attempt, that Mowbray’s sins weigh so heavily on him that his horse’s back breaks and throws him to the ground! Goodbye, old Gaunt. My grief is so great that I must end my life. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Sister, goodbye. I have to go to Coventry. May we both fare well! 
###DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER
Just one more word. When grief falls, it rises again, even though it is heavy and not light and empty. I’ve said goodbye before I said everything that I wanted to say. Give my respects to your brother, Edmund York. That’s all, but wait—don’t leave yet! I’ll think of something else. Tell him—what?—tell him to visit me at Plashy soon. Alas, what will he see there but empty servants’ quarters, bare walls, and floors that no one walks on? What will he hear as a welcome but my groans? So give my greetings, but don’t tell him to visit me there, since he can find sorrow easily enough elsewhere. I’ll go and die alone, and now I weep, having to finally say goodbye to you. 
##They exit separately. 
##The jousting fields at Coventry.
##The LORD MARSHAL and the DUKE OF AUMERLE enter. 
###LORD MARSHAL
My Lord Aumerle, does Harry Hereford have his weapons? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Yes, completely, and he wants to begin. 
###LORD MARSHAL
The spirited and bold Duke of Norfolk is just waiting for his accuser’s summons. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Why, then, they are both ready, and we’re only waiting on the king’s entrance. 
##Trumpets blow. KING RICHARD II enters with JOHN OF GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and others. Once they are seated, THOMAS MOWBRAY enters with his weapons. A herald also enters. 
###KING RICHARD II
Marshal, ask the combatant why he’s come here with weapons. Ask him his name and make him swear in accordance with the rules that his mission is one of justice. 
###LORD MARSHAL
In God’s name and the king’s, tell us who you are and why you have come here with armor and weapons. Who is your opponent, and what is your quarrel? Tell us the truth, as you’ve sworn on your knighthood. Make your defense. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
My name is Thomas Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk. I’ve come as I had sworn to— God forbid a knight breaks his oath! I’m here both to defend my loyalty and the truth of my testimony to God, my king, and any children that I might have. With the grace of God and my ability to fight, I’ll prove that my opponent, the Duke of Hereford, is a traitor to God, the king, and to me. And may heaven protect me, since I fight with honor! 
##A personal trumpet call is played. HENRY BOLINGBROKE, the accuser, enters, with a herald. 
###KING RICHARD II
Marshal, ask that knight who he is and why he is here armed for war. Make him formally testify as to the reason he is here to fight, as our law requires. 
###LORD MARSHAL
What is your name, and why do you come here in front of King Richard? Who is your opponent? What is your quarrel? Speak like a true knight! 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I am Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby. I am ready to prove with my weapons, with God’s grace, and with my strength that Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, is a foul traitor, dangerous to King Richard and to me. May heaven defend me, since I fight for truth! 
###LORD MARSHAL
Only the marshal and the appointed officials may direct the proceedings, and any other person foolish enough to enter the field will be put to death. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Lord marshal, let me kiss the king’s hand and go on my knee before him. Mowbray and I are about to undertake a challenge similar to a long and difficult journey, so we should say a formal goodbye to our friends. 
###LORD MARSHAL
The accuser greets your highness and asks to kiss your hand and say goodbye. 
###KING RICHARD II
I’ll step down and embrace him. Cousin of Hereford, insofar as your cause is just, I wish you luck in this fight. Goodbye, my cousin. If you die in this fight, I will grieve, but I won’t take revenge. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
If I am pierced by Mowbray’s lance, don’t misuse your tears for me. I’m as confident as the hawk is when he hunts the sparrow. My loving king, goodbye, and goodbye my cousin, Lord Aumerle. I’m healthy, young, and alive now, even if I’m close to death. Lastly, I’ll say farewell to you, my father, just as at a feast I save the best morsel for the end. Oh my creator, your youthful spirit is reborn in me and energizes me to reach for victory. Give strength to my armor with your prayers, and harden my lance with your blessing, so it will pierce Mowbray’s coat of armor. May my brave deeds bring new honor to the name of John of Gaunt. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
May God give you success in your good cause! Strike as quick as lightning, and let your blows fall like thunder on the helmet of your enemy. Be courageous and fierce, and stay alive. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My innocence and Saint George will protect me! 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
Whatever God or fate has in store for me, I will live or die as a loyal, just, and honest gentleman. I joyfully celebrate this battle against my enemy, as much as any slave celebrates who takes off his chains and becomes free. Most powerful king and my friends, I wish you all happiness in the years to come. I go to fight as happily as I would join in a celebration, because knowing that I have truth on my side makes me feel calm. 
###KING RICHARD II
Goodbye, my lord. I see both virtue and courage in you. Marshal, let’s begin. 
###LORD MARSHAL
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, take your lance. May God defend the right man! 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
With strength and hope, I say, Amen. 
###LORD MARSHAL
Take this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. 
###FIRST HERALD
At the risk of being proved false, here stands Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby to demonstrate that the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, is a traitor to his God, his king, and to him. He dares him to step forward and fight. 
###SECOND HERALD
At the risk of being proved false, here stands Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, to defend himself and to prove that Henry of Hereford is disloyal to God, his king, and to him. By his own free will and with courage, he waits for the signal to begin. 
###LORD MARSHAL
Trumpets, play. Step forward, combatants. 
##The trumpets play to signal the charge. 
Stop, the king has thrown down his baton. 
###KING RICHARD II
Tell them to take off their helmets, lay down their spears, and come back to their chairs by me. Tell the trumpets to play until I deliver my decree to these men. 
##The trumpets play.
Draw near, and listen to what I have devised with my council. Our kingdom, where you both grew up, should not be soiled with your blood, and I hate the spectacle of settling such quarrels with swords. I think that pride, ambition, and envy have caused you to disturb the sweet peace of this country. Once that peace is broken by war drums and the clash of weapons, relatives will be killing each other. Therefore, I’m sending you out into distant territories. You, my cousin Hereford, at the threat of execution if you return, are banished for ten years. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I will do as you command. My comfort in my banishment will be the thought that the same sun that shines on you will shine on me wherever I am. 
###KING RICHARD II
Norfolk, I reluctantly must give you a harsher sentence. Your absence won’t be marked by a certain number of hours. I must banish you for life. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
It’s a heavy sentence, my lord, and I didn’t expect to hear you say that. I deserved to be rewarded, not punished so harshly with exile. I’ll have to abandon my native English language, which I’ve spoken for forty years. My tongue will be of as little use as a broken violin. You’ve imprisoned it, and ignorance will be my jailer. I’m too old to learn anything new. You’ve sentenced me to die in silence. 
###KING RICHARD II
It doesn’t help to despair, and once my sentence is handed out it is too late to lament. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
Then I’ll turn away from the light of this country and resign myself to darkness. 
###KING RICHARD II
Come back, and take an oath. Put your hands on my sword and swear this by your duty to God—since your duty to me will end with your banishment—that you will never greet each other in exile, or write to each other, or make up with each other, and that you won’t plot any foul deed against me, my country, my subjects, or any of my land. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I swear. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
So do I. 
###HENRY OF BOLINGBROKE
If the king had allowed us to fight, Norfolk my enemy, one of us would be dead by now. One of our souls would have been banished from its body, just as our bodies are now banished from this country. Confess your treason before you go. Don’t take the cumbersome burden of those sins with you. 
###THOMAS MOWBRAY
No, Bolingbroke. If I were ever a traitor, may I die and be forbidden from heaven! But you and I and God all know what you are, and I fear that the king will find out all too soon—to his sorrow. Goodbye, my lord. Now I’m unable to lose my way, since my way is anywhere in the world other than England. 
##He exits.
###KING RICHARD II
Uncle, I can see in your eyes how much you are grieving. Since you are so sad, I’ll reduce your son’s exile by four years. 
##To HENRY BOLINGBROKE 
After six years, you will be welcome to come home. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
How much time is kept in a word! Four slow winters and four lush springs taken away in a word. That’s the power of a king. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Thank you, my lord, for shortening my son’s exile for my sake. But I won’t gain much by it. By the time six years have passed I will be dead and won’t be able to see my son. 
###KING RICHARD II
Why, uncle, you have many years left to live. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
But you can’t give me an extra minute of life. You can shorten my days by adding this sorrow, but you can’t add any time. You can cause me to furrow my brow, but you can’t stop a wrinkle from forming. You can order my death with a word, but once I’m dead, nothing can be done to give me another breath. 
###KING RICHARD II
Banishing your son was a good solution, and you agreed to it. Why now do you look so gloomy at my justice? 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Sometimes a thing that tastes sweet later makes you feel sick. You asked me to be a judge, but I would rather have argued as a father. If it had been a stranger rather than my son, I would have been milder. I wanted to avoid seeming soft, and, in the process, destroyed myself. Alas, I expected someone to say I was too strict in banishing my own son, but you let me agree to this terrible decision. 
###KING RICHARD II
Cousin, farewell. Uncle, say goodbye, too. I’ve banished him for six years, and he must go. 
##Trumpets blow. KING RICHARD II and his assistants exit. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Cousin, goodbye. Send me a letter telling me where you are, since I won’t be able to hear it from you in person. 
###LORD MARSHAL
My lord, I won’t say goodbye. I’ll ride with you as far as I can. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Why are you remaining silent? Won’t you say goodbye to your friends? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I should be able to tell you in several ways how sad I feel, but I have no words to express how sad I feel in saying goodbye to you. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Your grief is just that you’ll be absent for a time. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
With joy gone, grief will take up that whole time. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Six years will go by quickly. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
To a happy man they would pass quickly, but with sorrow one hour feels like ten. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Think of it as a pleasure trip. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
To pretend it is a vacation will only make it worse. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Think of these sorrowful years as a way to make your return home even happier. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
No, every step I take away will only remind me how far I am from what I love. I’ll be serving so many long years in a foreign land, and, other than my freedom, I’ll have nothing to show for it at the end. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
A wise man knows that anywhere heaven looks down upon is a refuge. Force yourself to think this way, because you have to. Don’t think that the king banished you but rather that you are the king. Sorrow weighs heaviest on those who bear it timidly. Pretend I sent you to go prove yourself, not that the king banished you. Or pretend that there is a plague here and that you are seeking a healthier place. Imagine that what you want the most can be found in the direction you are going, not the direction you’re coming from. Pretend the birds are musicians, and the flowers along your path are fair ladies, and your steps are a dance. Sorrow has no power to hurt the man who makes fun of it and who keeps a sense of humor. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Who can hold a flame by pretending that it is ice? Or satisfy hunger just by thinking about a feast? Or roll in the snow naked by imagining the heat of summer? Oh, no! Imagining the best only makes the worst harder to bear. Sorrow hurts most when you treat the pain it creates without curing the cause. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Come, come, my son, I’ll put you on your way. If I were young enough, I wouldn’t remain here. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Then goodbye, England’s earth. Goodbye, sweet soil, my motherland. Wherever I go, I can boast that I am a true Englishman, even if I am banished. 
##They exit.
##King Richard II’s palace.
## KING RICHARD II enters. BAGOT and GREEN stand at one door, and the DUKE OF AUMERLE stands at another. 
###KING RICHARD II
How far did you escort proud Hereford? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
I took proud Hereford, if you want to call him that, just to the next highway and left him there. 
###KING RICHARD II
And how many tears were shed? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Honestly, none on my part. Although the wind was blowing bitterly against our faces, making our eyes water. I suppose by chance that made me shed some tears. 
###KING RICHARD II
What did my cousin say when you left him? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
“Goodbye.” But I didn’t say it back, because that word has always been a way to disguise my grief when leaving someone, and I certainly didn’t have any grief to disguise this time. In fact, if saying goodbye would have made hours longer and added years to his banishment, I would have given him many goodbyes. But I knew that it wouldn’t, so I gave him none. 
###KING RICHARD II
He is our cousin, cousin. But I doubt that he’ll come see his relatives when he returns home from his exile. Bushy, Bagot, Green, and I watched how he courts the common people, and he seems to endear himself to them with humble courtesy. He wasted reverence on slaves and courted poor craftsman with smiles and a patient acceptance of his fate, as though he were hoping to take their affection with him into exile. He took off his hat to a woman selling oysters. Several oxen drivers blessed his journey, and he went on one knee and told them, “Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends.” It was as though my England were his and my subjects were placing their hope in him. 
###GREEN
Well, he is gone, and any thoughts like that go with him. Now we must make an urgent plan to deal with the rebels in Ireland, my lord, before giving them time to act gives them an advantage and puts you at a loss. 
###KING RICHARD II
lease out our right to tax the people. The revenue from that will keep the country running. If that doesn’t bring in enough, then my deputies here will have authority to make the rich lords turn over however much of their gold we choose to supply what we need. I’ll leave for Ireland at once. 
## BUSHY enters.
Bushy, what is the news? 
###BUSHY
Old John of Gaunt is suddenly very ill, my lord. He sent word asking that your majesty visit him as soon as possible. 
###KING RICHARD II
Where is he? 
###BUSHY
At Ely House. 
###KING RICHARD II
God, let the physician help him die quickly! His fortune will pay for the soldiers’ coats in this Irish war. Come, gentleman, let’s go visit him. Let’s hurry, but pray we still arrive too late! 
###ALL
Amen. 
##They exit. 
##Ely Palace, London.
## JOHN OF GAUNT, who is very sick, and the DUKE OF YORK, as well as a few assistants, enter.
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Is the young, wild king going to come visit me so I can give him my last words of advice before I die? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Don’t waste the little strength you have worrying about that. Even if he did come, the king doesn’t listen to advice. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Also, in general, people pay more attention at the end of somebody’s life. It’s just like the last bite of dessert—it’s the sweetest part, the part you try to make last, and the part you remember most. So, even though King Richard ignored me throughout my life, maybe he’ll listen to me now that I am dying. 
###DUKE OF YORK
No, he won’t listen—his ears are stuffed with all the sounds that make him happy, like the flattery and praise he receives, which wise men know to be wary of. He also likes raunchy poems, which immature young people always listen to. And he listens to the fashion reports from Italy, which England is always copying and always shamefully trying to catch up to. As long as it is new, no matter how awful it is, it instantly grabs Richard’s attention. His desire for all of these things doesn’t allow him to listen to good advice. Don’t give him direction, because he chooses his own course. You’ll just be wasting your precious breath. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
As I lie here dying, I think that God is suddenly letting me see the king’s future. The king can’t go on living a wasteful lifestyle forever, in the same way that a raging fire will eventually burn itself out. Little rainstorms often go on for a long time, but big, violent thunderstorms come and go quickly. The person who starts off too fast will soon tire out, and the person who eats too fast will choke on his food. The hungry bird that can’t get enough to eat will soon eat itself. This kingdom, this majestic Earth, this paradise, this fortress that Nature built to protect herself against disease and war, this lucky race of people, this little world, this precious jewel of an island sitting in the sea—which protects it like a wall or a moat against the evil intentions of less fortunate countries—this blessed land, this England, this fertile mother of kings who are feared and famous for their Christian actions throughout the world, this land of such good people, this wonderful, wonderful land—it is now rented out, and I’m going to have to die watching it happen. England is surrounded by an ocean whose rocky shore has always pushed back the raging waters. Now, though, England is bound in shame by legal papers, made of rotting parchment and covered in inky blots, that were signed to rent it out. England, which is used to conquering other countries, has now shamefully conquered itself. Oh, how I wish this scandal would die and go away, just like I’m about to die. How happy my death would be then! 
## KING RICHARD II, the QUEEN, the DUKE OF AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT, LORD ROSS, and LORD WILLOUGHBY enter.
###DUKE OF YORK
(to John of Guant) The king is here. Go easy with him. He is young and easy to make angry, and if you give him a hard time, you’re likely to do nothing but make him angrier. 
###QUEEN
How are you, John of Gaunt? 
###KING RICHARD II
Yes, John of Gaunt, tell us how you are. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
My name is Gaunt, and I feel gaunt. I am gaunt because of my old age. And who can go without food and not be gaunt? I have stayed awake and watched England crumble for a long time, and from all the lack of sleep I’ve grown gaunt. Fathers receive nourishment from seeing their children, and since I can’t see my child it has made me gaunt. I’m ready for my grave, and when I’m laid in it I’ll be nothing but bones. 
###KING RICHARD II
Can men who are really sick play so subtly with their names? 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Misery likes to make fun of itself. And I thought you might enjoy listening to me make fun of my name since you are banishing my son, who, of course, shares my name. 
###KING RICHARD II
Should dying men try to amuse the living? 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
No, no, the living should try to amuse the dying. 
###KING RICHARD II
You, who are dying, tell me that you’re trying to please me. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Oh no! You’re the one dying, even though I’m sicker. 
###KING RICHARD II
I’m in good health. I’m breathing fine, and I can see that you are the one who is sick. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
God knows that I can see the sickness in you. You don’t realize it, but your deathbed is actually the country that you’ve been destroying. And you’re too stupid to realize that the people you think will cure you are actually the ones making you sick—those flatterers and yes-men you surround yourself with. You don’t even see that your subjects are turning on you. You have laid waste to all of England. If your grandfather had been able to see how you were going to destroy this country, he would’ve reached into the future and stopped you. My brother, it is an utter shame to lease parts of England out to others. You aren’t the king of England anymore. You are simply the landlord of England, and you— 
###KING RICHARD II
You idiot, taking advantage of your illness as an opportunity to criticize me. How dare you anger and embarrass me so much that my face has gone pale. If you weren’t my uncle—that is, the uncle to the King of England—that wild tongue of yours would fall from the head that sits on your disobedient shoulders. 
###JOHN OF GAUNT
Don’t do me any favors because I’m your uncle. You have never before hesitated to spill our family’s royal blood. My good and simple brother Gloucester, who had royal blood and is happily in heaven now, is someone you weren’t afraid to kill. Like a dead flower, your wicked behavior must be plucked immediately. You have lived a bad life, but you must change your ways before you die. May my words torment you always! (to his assistants) Take me to my bed, and then let me die. Let only those who are honorable and loving live happily. 
## JOHN OF GAUNT is carried off the stage by his assistants.
###KING RICHARD II
And let those who are old and gloomy die, and you, John of Gaunt, are both. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I beg you, your majesty, blame his words on his age and his sickness. I swear that he loves you and holds you as close to his heart as he does Harry Duke of Hereford. 
###KING RICHARD II
Right, what you say is true. Just as Harry holds me close to his heart, John of Gaunt must hold me also. And, in turn, I love both of them. That’s how it is. 
## NORTHUMBERLAND enters.
###NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord, Gaunt sends his regards to you. 
###KING RICHARD II
What did he say? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Actually, he didn’t say anything. He can’t talk. He has died. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I hope that I will be the next to die! Death is terrible, but at least it stops the pain of living. 
###KING RICHARD II
Gaunt is the first to die, just like the ripest fruit is always the first to fall off the tree. Well, that’s over with. Now, about the war in Ireland. We must get rid of those shaggy-haired Irish soldiers who live there. Let’s seize all of Gaunt’s money and property to help pay for the war. 
###DUKE OF YORK
How long can I hold out? How long will my obligation to the king make me suffer these wrongs against Gaunt? Nothing has ever made me show my frustrations—not Gloucester’s death, nor Hereford’s banishment, nor Gaunt’s criticisms, nor the king’s bad treatment of England, nor the king’s refusal to let Bolingbroke marry, nor my own ill treatment. I am the last of Edward’s sons. Your father, the Prince of Wales, was the first. There was never anyone more fierce in wartime and more gentle in peacetime than the Prince of Wales. You look just like him when he was your age. When he got upset, it was against the French, not against his allies. He spent only what he’d earned, and he never spent anything that his father had won. He never did anything wrong to his countrymen, but he punished his enemies. Richard, I am too upset, or I would never make these comparisons. 
###KING RICHARD II
Why, uncle, what’s the matter? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Oh, my lord, forgive me, please. If you won’t I’ll understand. Do you really want to seize all of Gaunt’s property? He might be dead, but isn’t his son still alive? Wasn’t Gaunt a good man, and isn’t Harry good, too? Doesn’t Gaunt deserve to have an heir? And isn’t Harry a deserving heir? If you take away Harry’s right to inherit his father’s belongings, then you are going against tradition. It would be like taking away Time’s authority and rights and preventing tomorrow from following today. Remember, you yourself are a king because you inherited the position. Now, I swear before God, if you do this, you will bring all sorts of danger to yourself and turn a thousand people against you. You will force me to lose my patience, and I’ll think about doing things to you that, because I still honor and obey you, I cannot even think about. 
###KING RICHARD II
Think whatever you want, but we’re going to seize his money and all of his property. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I won’t stand here and watch. Goodbye, my lord. What will happen now, nobody can say. But no good outcome can result from bad decisions like this. 
## DUKE OF YORK exits.
###KING RICHARD II
Bushy, go straight to the Earl of Wiltshire and tell him to come to Ely House to help us. Tomorrow morning we’ll go to Ireland. I believe it’s time. I’ll make my uncle York the Lord Governor of England while I’m away. He is fair and has always loved me very much. Come, my queen, we must leave tomorrow. Be well. 
##Trumpets blow, as KING RICHARD II, the QUEEN, the DUKE OF AUMERLE, BUSY, GREEN, and BAGOT exit.
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. 
###LORD ROSS
But he also kind of lives because his son is now a duke. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
His son might have the title of duke, but he doesn’t have the income of one. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
If there were justice in the world then he would both have the title and the income. 
###LORD ROSS
I have a lot of troubles on my mind. But I must keep silent about them for now. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Speak your mind. And if anyone uses what you say against you, let that person never speak again! 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
Are you going to say something about the Duke of Hereford? If so, say it, man! I am always eager to hear good things about him. 
###LORD ROSS
I can’t do him any good, unless it’s good to pity him, since he’s now deprived of his inheritance. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
With God as my witness, I say it’s a shame that such wrongs have been done to him and to others of royal blood in this crumbling land. The king is not acting like himself. He’s being deceived by his group of flatterers. Purely out of hatred they make accusations against us, leading the king to persecute us and our children. 
###LORD ROSS
He’s taxed the common people heavily, and they’ve turned against him. He’s also fined the nobles for old grudges and turned them against him, as well. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
Every day he devises new ways of forcing people to pay, like mandatory loans and I don’t know what else. What, in God’s name, is he doing with all of this money? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
He hasn’t spent the money on wars because he hasn’t waged any wars. He has shamefully compromised with our enemies and given away what our ancestors won in battle. He’s spent more in peacetime than they did in wartime. 
###LORD ROSS
The Earl of Wiltshire has rented out the land. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
The king is bankrupt. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
He is disgraced. 
###LORD ROSS
The only way he can afford to fight the war in Ireland, even with all the money that he’s collected from these new taxes, is by stealing everything from the Duke of Hereford. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Friends, we see this storm coming, and yet we don’t seek any shelter to avoid it! We see the wind blowing fiercely upon our sails, and yet we don’t lower the sails but recklessly perish. 
###LORD ROSS
We see the shipwreck coming, but the danger is unavoidable now because we sat by and allowed all this to happen. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
That’s not true. Even though we are close to ruin, I can see a way out. But I’m not going to say how near the news of our rescue is. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
Please tell us your thoughts, as we have told you ours. 
###LORD ROSS
Have the confidence to speak, Northumberland. The three of us are just like you. If you speak, you’ll most likely say what we’re already thinking. Be bold. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Then here it is: I have learned that the Duke of Bretagne, in Brittany, has given eight large ships to Harry Duke of Hereford as well as Rainold Lord Cobhman—who recently broke his alliance with the Duke of Exeter—his brother, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston, Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint. These men sailed the ships with three thousand soldiers from Port le Blanc, and right now they are racing to England. They left as soon as the king departed for Ireland. If you want to be free of your slavery to the king, help our country to rise again, and restore the honor of our royalty, then come with me right now to Ravenspurgh. If you’re afraid to do so, then wait here while I go myself. 
###LORD ROSS
To our horses! Encourage anyone who is scared. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
If my horse holds up, I’ll be the first one there. 
##They exit.
##King Richard II’s palace.
##The QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT enter. 
###BUSHY
Madam, you are too sad. When we left the king, you promised to stop worrying so much and to try to act more cheerfully. 
###QUEEN
I promised that to make the king happy, but for myself I cannot do it. I don’t know why I should be so sad, except that I had to say goodbye to my sweet Richard. But I also think that something bad is going to happen to me and I’m inwardly grieving. It’s making me more sad than the king’s leaving does. 
###BUSHY
When you’re already sad it seems like everything is awful and your grief is multiplied. But, in reality, that’s not the case. Because you’re sad, things don’t appear to you as they actually are, so in your husband’s departure you see many things to grieve. Those are just shadows. So don’t cry for anything but your husband’s leaving. Any other causes of grief are just imaginary. 
###QUEEN
That may be true, but my instinct tells me otherwise. Whatever the case, I feel nothing but grief. In fact, I feel so sad that even when I’m not thinking about anything at all I feel woefully faint and weak. 
###BUSHY
That’s nothing but your imagination, my queen. 
###QUEEN
Far from it. Imaginary feelings of grief are always the result of some real, prior grief. But that’s not my situation, as nothing has happened to me to cause my grief. My grief is reversed: I feel a grief whose cause I haven’t experienced yet. But I don’t know what that is. I can’t name it. All I know is that it’s a nameless sadness. 
## GREEN enters.
###GREEN
God save the queen! And good to see you, too, gentlemen. I hope the king hasn’t left yet for Ireland. 
###QUEEN
Why do you hope that? It’s better if he has since his plans require that he act quickly, so why do you hope he hasn’t sailed? 
###GREEN
Our hope is that he might have brought his forces back from Ireland and caused our enemy, Bolingbroke, to give up. Even though he is exiled he has returned to England. He and a strong army have arrived safely to Ravenspurgh ready to fight. 
###QUEEN
God, no! 
###GREEN
Madam, it’s true, and what’s worse is that Lord Northumberland, his young son Henry Percy, the Lord of Ross, the Lord of Beaumond, and the Lord of Willoughby, along with their powerful friends, have all gone to join him. 
###BUSHY
Why haven’t you proclaimed Northumberland and the others traitors? 
###GREEN
We did, and that’s when the Earl of Worcester broke his staff, resigned his job, and, along with the king’s servants, fled to join Bolingbroke. 
###QUEEN
So, Green, you have helped me to give birth: I was pregnant with sorrow, Bolingbroke is the newborn child, and I am like a gasping mother who has just delivered her baby. 
###BUSHY
Madam, do not despair. 
###QUEEN
Who’s going to stop me? I will despair, and I will not put up with any false hopes. False hope flatters and feeds on us, draws out our pain, and withholds death, which would be gentle otherwise. 
##The DUKE OF YORK enters. 
###GREEN
Here comes the Duke of York. 
###QUEEN
His old neck shows signs of war. Oh, his face is full of anxiety! Uncle, for God’s sake, give us good news. 
###DUKE OF YORK
If I were to give you good news, I would be hiding my real thoughts. Good news is in heaven, and we are on earth, where nothing lives but trials, anxieties, and sorrow. Your husband has gone to protect his rule in Ireland, while others have come here to take it from him in England. Here I am, too old to support myself, left to prop up his country. The bad times that we thought his overindulgent ways would bring have arrived. Now his friends will be tested. 
##A Servant enters. 
###SERVANT
My lord, your son was gone before I arrived. 
###DUKE OF YORK
The nobles have fled, the commoners aren’t concerned, and they will likely fight on Hereford’s side. Sir, get thee to Plashy, to my sister-in-law Gloucester. Tell her to send me one thousand pounds right away. Wait, take my ring. 
###SERVANT
My lord, I forgot to tell you, I went by her house today. But it will upset you if I tell you the rest. 
###DUKE OF YORK
What is it, boy? 
###SERVANT
An hour before I got there, your sister-in-law died. 
###DUKE OF YORK
God have mercy! What a tide of troubles comes rushing over this land all at once! I don’t know what to do. I wish to God that the king had cut off my head when he cut off my brother’s. Has no one sent any messengers to Ireland yet? How are we going to pay for these wars? Come, sister—or I should say, cousin. Excuse me. (to the servant) Go home, fellow, and find some carts and bring the armor that’s there. 
##The Servant exits.
Gentlemen, will you go round up some men? I don’t know what I should do now. Both Richard and Bolingbroke are my kinsmen. One is my king, to whom I’ve pledged allegiance and have a duty to defend. The other is my kinsman, whom the king has mistreated. My conscience and my family bonds tell me to right those wrongs. Well, we’ve got to do something. (to the queen) Come, cousin, I’ll make arrangements for you. Gentlemen, go and round up some men and meet me at Berkeley Castle. I should go to Plashy, too, but there isn’t enough time. Everything is in chaos. 
##The DUKE OF YORK and the QUEEN exit.
###BUSHY
The message has probably reached Ireland, but no news has come back yet. It’s impossible for us to find enough soldiers to match the enemy’s force. 
###GREEN
Besides, our closeness to the king means we are hated by those who hate the king. 
###BAGOT
And that’s how the common folk must be. Their love depends on who gives them money, and they hate those who take their money away. 
###BUSHY
That’s why almost all the common folk hate the king. 
###BAGOT
If they’re to be the judges, then our fate is in their hands, because we’ve always been on the side of the king. 
###GREEN
Well, I’m going straight to Bristol Castle to take refuge. The Earl of Wiltshire is already there. 
###BUSHY
I’ll go with you. The hateful common folk won’t help us at all but will act like dogs and tear us to pieces. Will you come with us? 
###BAGOT
No. I’ll go to the king in Ireland. Goodbye. If my instinct is correct, the three of us here will never meet again. 
###BUSHY
That depends on whether York can defeat Bolingbroke. 
###GREEN
Oh, poor duke! The task he must begin is as hard as counting the sand in a desert or drinking all the water in the ocean. For every person who fights with him, there will be thousands who will not. Goodbye immediately and forever. 
###BUSHY
Well, we might meet again. 
###BAGOT
I fear that we won’t. 
##They exit.
##In the woods in Gloucestershire.
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND enter with an army. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
How much farther is it to Berkeley, my lord? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Believe me, my noble lord, I’m a stranger to these parts. These high and wild hills go on for miles and are tiring. And yet your good conversation has been like sugar, making the difficult journey sweeter. But I think it will be a long and hard journey from Ravenspurgh to Cotswold for Ross and Willoughby since they won’t have your company, which has made my trip easier. But their trip will be made more enjoyable by the expectation that you’ll go with them next time. In this way, the journey for those tired lords will seem shorter. That’s what has happened to me. My journey has seemed shorter because you’ve been with me. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My companionship isn’t nearly as valuable as your kind words. Who’s coming? 
## HENRY PERCY enters.
###NORTHUMBERLAND
It’s my son, young Harry Percy. He was sent by my brother Worcester, wherever he may be. Harry, how is your uncle Worcester? 
###HENRY PERCY
I was thinking, my lord, that you would tell me that. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Is he not with the queen? 
###HENRY PERCY
No, my good lord. He has abandoned the court. He broke his staff and let the king’s servants go. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
What was his reason? The last time we were together he hadn’t decided to do that. 
###HENRY PERCY
He did it because you were proclaimed a traitor. But, my lord, he’s gone now to Ravenspurgh, to help the Duke of Hereford, and he sent me to Berkeley to discover how large an army the Duke of York had there. Then he gave me orders to go on to Ravenspurgh. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Have you forgotten who the Duke of Hereford is, boy? 
###HENRY PERCY
No, my good lord, because I can’t forget something I never remembered. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him in my life. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Then meet him now. This is the duke. 
###HENRY PERCY
My gracious lord, I am in your service. I am young, but as I get older, I will demonstrate more impressive abilities. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Thank you, kind Percy. I count myself happiest when remembering my good friends. I know that the reward for your love will be to witness how it helps me find greater success. My heart makes this promise to you, and this handshake seals that promise. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
How far is it to Berkeley? And what events keep good old York there with his soldiers? 
###HENRY PERCY
There’s the castle, over by that group of trees. I’ve heard that it’s protected by three hundred men, and that the Lord of York, the Lord of Berkeley, and the Lord of Seymour are there. There’s no one else of title and noble reputation inside. 
## LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY enter.
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Here come the Lord of Ross and the Lord of Willoughby. They are bloody from sticking their spurs so hard into their horses, and their faces are red from riding here so fast. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Welcome, my lords. I know that you’ve followed me here out of love for me. Right now I can only pay you with my thanks, but once I have money I’ll repay your love and hard work. 
###LORD ROSS
We are rich enough from just being here with you here, most noble lord. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
And that richness is much more than anything we could earn by working. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
The poor earn their wealth in the form of gratitude. Until my young fortune matures, that gratitude will have to take the place of riches. But who’s coming now? 
## LORD BERKELEY enters.
###NORTHUMBERLAND
I think it’s the Lord of Berkeley. 
###LORD BERKELEY
Lord of Hereford, I have a message for you. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My lord, I will answer only to my proper name, the Duke of Lancaster. And I have come to claim that name here in England. I must hear you call me that title before I respond to anything else you say. 
###LORD BERKELEY
Don’t misunderstand, my lord. It’s not my intention to deny you your title. I’ve come to you, my lord—whatever title you want me to use—from the most gracious regent in this land, that is the Duke of York. I need to know what has led you to exploit the absence of our king and jeopardize the peace in this land with your armies. 
##The DUKE OF YORK and his assistants enter. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
(to Lord Berkeley) I won’t have to pass my message through you. Here comes his grace in person. (to the Duke of York) My noble uncle! 
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE kneels.
###DUKE OF YORK
I don’t want to see you kneeling. I know you don’t really honor me. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My gracious uncle— 
###DUKE OF YORK
Tsk, tsk! Don’t call me grace, and don’t call me uncle. I am not the uncle of a traitor, and it’s obscene to use that word “grace” when everybody knows you’re ungracious. You were banished, so why have you come back to England? Why have you and your army marched miles across peaceful England, scaring villagers with threats of war and displays of hateful weapons? Have you come now because the king is away? Why, you foolish boy, don’t you know that the king has put me in charge while he’s away and that I am loyal to him? If I were still the strong young man who, with your father, John of Gaunt, rescued the king’s father from thousands of French soldiers, I would quickly smack you. But my arm is too weak and shaky to administer punishment in that way. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My gracious uncle, why don’t you tell me exactly what I’ve done wrong? 
###DUKE OF YORK
You’ve done the worst that you can: rebellion and treason. You are banished from this country and now you’ve returned before you are allowed to do so. And you’ve brought an army to fight against your king. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I was banished as Hereford, but I return as Lancaster. And, noble uncle, I beg that you look at my missteps impartially. I think I see my father in you. Oh, then, my father, are you going to force me to be a wandering drifter forever, while what is rightfully mine is taken away by force and given to wasteful social climbers? Why was I born? If my cousin is allowed to be the King of England, then I must be allowed to be the Duke of Lancaster. You have a son, Aumerle, who is my noble cousin. Let’s say that you died, and he had been treated this way. His uncle Gaunt would have acted as a father to him and fought to correct the wrongs done against him. I’m not allowed to claim my inheritance, though I’m legally entitled to do so. My father’s possessions have all been wrongfully confiscated and sold. What do you think I should do? I am a subject of the King of England, aren’t I? I claim what is lawfully mine. Since I’m not allowed to have attorneys, I must claim my inheritance myself. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
The noble duke has been abused very much. 
###LORD ROSS
You owe it to him to treat him well. 
###LORD WILLOUGHBY
His money and property are making lowly men rich. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Listen, lords of England: I’ve known about the injustices done to my cousin, and I have done everything I could to correct them. But because of the way he’s returned to England, with an army and all these weapons, there’s nothing I can do. And you who are helping him are just lowly rebels. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
The noble duke has sworn he has come back to England only for his own sake and not for any other reason. We have all sworn to help him, and I hope anyone who breaks that promise never feels joy again. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Well, well, I see how this is going to go. I admit I can’t change it, because my army is weak. But if God would let me, I’d arrest you all and make you stoop down before our king. But since I can’t, I’m going to remain neutral. So, good luck to you. Or do you want to come sleep in the castle tonight? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Yes, uncle, we do. But first we must convince you to go with us to Bristol Castle, which I’ve heard is being held by Bushy, Bagot, and their accomplices. They are devouring the kingdom like caterpillars, and I’ve sworn to eliminate them. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I might go with you, but let me think about it first. I hate to break our country’s laws. I look at you neither as a friend nor a foe, and I don’t care about people’s past misdeeds that can’t be fixed now. 
##They exit.
##A camp in Wales.
##The EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain enter.
###CAPTAIN
My lord of Salisbury, we’ve waited here for ten days and have had difficulty keeping our countrymen together. Since we’ve heard nothing from the king, we’re going to leave. Goodbye. 
###EARL OF SALISBURY
My trusty Welshman, please stay one more day. The king has placed all his confidence in you. 
###CAPTAIN
It’s believed that the king is dead, and we’re not going to stay. The trees in our country are all withered, and there are meteors flashing in the sky and scaring the stars. The moon has turned red, and the fortunetellers say that bad things are going to happen. Rich men suddenly look sad because they’re afraid they’re going to lose their possessions. And criminals are dancing because they know they’re going to steal those possessions violently. All of these signs point to the death, or at least the fall, of kings. Goodbye. My countrymen have already fled, as they know that King Richard II is dead. 
##He exits. 
###EARL OF SALISBURY
Ah, Richard, I can see that your glory, like a shooting star, is falling from the sky to the ground, and the thought is weighing heavily on my mind. Your sun is setting in the west and it’s crying, which tells me that storms of grief and chaos are coming. All of your friends have left you and pledged allegiance to your enemies, and fortune works against you. 
##He exits.
##In front of Bristol castle.
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE, the DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, LORD ROSS, HENRY PERCY, and LORD WILLOUGHBY, escorting the prisoners BUSHY and GREEN, enter.
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Bring these men to me. Bushy and Green, I won’t torment your souls with too much talk of your wicked lives since your souls will soon leave your bodies. But so no one may claim your execution was murder, I will explain with these men as witnesses why you are legally sentenced to death. You have deceived a king, a man who was happy and attractive until you came along and changed him. Through your evil ways, you have driven a wedge between the king and the queen. You’ve interfered with their happy marriage and caused the queen suffering. I, by the luck of my birth, am a prince. I am closely related to the king, and until you changed his feelings toward me, he loved me. Because of your actions, I’ve had to live in exile in a foreign country, and meanwhile you lived off my wealth and property here, leasing my hunting grounds to others and cutting down my forests. You tore my family’s coat of arms out of the windows of my house and destroyed all signs of my family’s existence. If not for men’s opinions and the fact that I’m still alive, no one would ever know that the property was mine and that I am a member of the nobility. These crimes and at least twice as many more condemn you to death. 
##[Addressing the others.]
Make sure they are executed soon. 
###BUSHY
I welcome death more than England welcomes the return of Bolingbroke. Lords, goodbye. 
###GREEN
I am comforted knowing that our souls will go to heaven and that heaven will give hell to Bolingbroke, who committed this injustice. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My lord Northumberland, see that they are killed. 
## NORTHUMBERLAND and others who are escorting the prisoners exit.
Uncle, you said that the queen is at your house. For God’s sake, let her be treated courteously. Give her my best, and make sure to deliver my greeting. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I’ve sent a gentleman to her with the message. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Thanks, kind uncle. Come, lords, let’s leave. We’ve got to fight Glendower and his accomplices. First, we’ll work, and then we’ll be able to rest. 
##They exit.
##The coast of Wales. A castle is in view.
##Drums are played. Trumpets blow. Military flags are carried onstage.
## KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the DUKE OF AUMERLE, and some soldiers enter. 
###KING RICHARD II
Do they call this castle Barkloughly castle? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Yes, my lord. How do you like it here, after you’ve been tossing about on the open seas? 
###KING RICHARD II
Of course I like it here. Standing here on my kingdom again makes me cry with joy. Dear earth, I salute you, even though insurgents are wounding you by riding their horses over you. Like a mother who has been away from her child for a long time, I cry and smile and greet you. Please, gentle earth, provide no nourishment or shelter for my enemies. Instead, let your venomous spiders and your toads get in their way. Put stinging nettles in their path. And when they pick a flower from the ground, let a poisonous snake bite and kill them. Lords, don’t make fun of me for asking this. The earth will have feelings, and these stones will turn into armed soldiers, before I, England’s legitimate king, let these terrible rebels defeat us. 
###BISHOP OF CARLISLE
Don’t worry, my lord, the power that made you king is the same power that will keep you king in spite of all these troubles. We must embrace the opportunities that God gives us and not neglect them. Otherwise, we’re rejecting both God’s protection from these problems as well as his solution for them. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
What he means, my lord, is that we’re being neglectful because of overconfidence, while Bolingbroke is growing stronger. 
###KING RICHARD II
You are so discouraging, cousin! Don’t you know that at nighttime, when the sun has set, thieves roam the earth unseen, boldly committing murder and other crimes? But when the sun comes up and lights the treetops and every dark hole, then those same criminals stand trembling with no way to hide. So when this thief, this traitor Bolingbroke, who has been committing all these crimes during the nighttime, sees us coming up with the sun, he’ll be ashamed and will tremble at the light of day. All the water in an ocean can’t wash away a king’s right to the throne. Mere mortals can’t get rid of someone who has been appointed by God. For every solider Bolingbroke has enlisted to fight against me, God has given me an angel. And when angels fight, the weak men fall, since heaven always guards those who are right. 
## EARL OF SALISBURY enters.
Welcome, my lord. How far away is your army? 
###EARL OF SALISBURY
My army consists only of me, and I am too upset to talk of anything but despair. We are one day too late and have lost our chance of seeing happy times again. Oh, I wish it were still yesterday. If we could go back in time, we’d have twelve thousand men ready to fight on our side! Today, today—it is an unhappy day. Today has taken away any chance for joy, friends, wealth, and power. All the Welshmen heard that you were dead, and they’ve all joined Bolingbroke’s army. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Cheer up, my lord. Why are you so pale? 
###KING RICHARD II
Only a moment ago, I had twenty thousand men fighting for me, and now they’ve all fled. Until they return, aren’t I allowed to look as pale as if I were dead? Anyone who wants to be safe flees from me, as recent events have tarnished my reputation. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Cheer up, my lord. Don’t forget that you’re the king. 
###KING RICHARD II
I forgot. I’m the king, aren’t I? Awake, you cowardly king. You’re sleeping. Isn’t being the king worth as much as twenty thousand men? Prepare for action, my name! A young and weak subject is trying to damage your glory. Don’t hang your head low. You favorite men of the king—aren’t we high above them all? Then we should aim high as well: I know my uncle York has enough troops for our needs. But who’s coming now? 
## SIR STEPHEN SCROOP enters.
###SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
I hope more health and happiness come to you, my lord, than my grief-stricken tongue can offer. 
###KING RICHARD II
My ears are open, and my heart is ready. The worst you can tell me about are losses for me here on earth. So, did I lose my kingdom? It was my problem, and what loss is it to be rid of a problem? Is Bolingbroke still trying to overthrow me? If he serves God, we will serve God, too, and then the two of us will be merely equals. Are our subjects revolting? We can’t fix that. They break their faith with God as well as with us. Though you may cry out about woe, destruction, ruin, and decay, death is the worst fate of all, and the time for death will come. 
###SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
I’m glad that your highness is prepared for the worst. Bolingbroke is bursting with rage and his army is attacking all across England. It’s like an unexpected flood that makes it seem like the world is crying. Even old men with white beards have joined forces against your majesty, and young boys who still speak in high-pitched voices. The men whom we paid to pray for us are also now on their side, and women are fighting against you as well. Everything is going far worse for you than I can possibly describe. 
###KING RICHARD II
You are describing these horrible things too vividly. Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot? What happened to Bushy? Where is Green? They didn’t let the dangerous enemy cross over our territories without any opposition, did they? If we win, they’ll pay for their failures with their heads. I’ll bet they’ve made peace with Bolingbroke. 
###SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
Oh, yes, they’ve made peace, my lord. 
###KING RICHARD II
Oh, they are villains and vipers, damned without any hope for redemption! They’re like dogs that will suck up to anyone! They’re three Judases, but each three times worse than Judas! I hope their guilt-stained souls are punished terribly for what they’ve done! 
###SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
I see how your love turns into the deadliest of hatred. Please, take back your curses. Their peace wasn’t made by joining forces with Bolingbroke. It was made with God, when they were executed. They are all in their graves now. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Are Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead? 
###SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
Yes, they were all beheaded at Bristol. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Where is my father with his army? 
###KING RICHARD II
It doesn’t matter where he is. Let’s not try to cheer ourselves up. We must talk about graves and worms and epitaphs. We’ll make the dust our paper and use our tears to write a message of sorrow on the earth. Let’s choose our executors and talk of wills. And, yet, what can we bequeath to anyone other than leaving our rotting bodies to the ground? Our lands and our lives now belong to Bolingbroke, and we can call nothing our own except for our deaths and that little patch of earth that will cover our buried bodies. For God’s sake, let’s sit on the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings, how some were overthrown and others killed in war. Some were haunted by the ghosts of the kings they had overthrown. Still others were poisoned by their wives, while others were killed in their sleep. All of them, however, were murdered. There is always death around kings, and there’s no way to escape it. Death laughs at the king’s reign and mocks his great ceremonies, allowing him to live a little while and play the monarch. Death fills him with pride as if the king’s body were immortal, and at the end death comes and with little effort kills the body. Then goodbye, king! So stop treating me so respectfully. There’s no need to pretend that I am any different than you. You’ve been wrong about me all this time. I feel all the same things that you do. I have desires and feel sad and need friends, just like you. How, then, can you say that I’m a king? 
###BISHOP OF CARLISLE
My lord, wise men never sit and feel sorry for themselves but try to fix the causes of their sorrow. Since fear weakens you, fearing your enemy only works against you and helps your enemy. If you’re scared, you’ll die. That’s the worst that can happen in battle. But fighting and dying is a way of beating death, because then you die nobly. But being scared and dying gives death the victory. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
My father has soldiers. Let’s figure out where he is and make an army out of the men he has. 
###KING RICHARD II
Your scolding does me good. Proud Bolingbroke, I’ll exchange blows with you on our day of destiny. My fit of fear has passed. It should be easy to get our men together. Scroop, where is my uncle with his men? Tell me good news, man, even though you look bad. 
###SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
Men often determine what the day is going to be like by looking at the sky, so you should know by my dull and gloomy eyes that I’m about to deliver bad news. I’m acting like a torturer, drawing out the pain of what I have to say. Your uncle York has joined forces with Bolingbroke. They have possession of all your northern castles now, and all your men of rank in the south are fighting for them, too. 
###KING RICHARD II
You have said enough. 
##To the DUKE OF AUMERLE 
I curse you, cousin, for convincing me not to be sad anymore. What do you have to say now? What comforts us now? I swear to God, I will forever hate the man who tells me not to despair now. Go to Flint Castle. That’s where I will wait. I am a king, but I am a slave of sorrow, and I will follow sorrow’s orders. Tell my army that they may leave and go work for some cause that has hope, since I have none. I don’t want to hear anyone trying to change my mind. Any advice is pointless. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
My lord, may I have a word. 
###KING RICHARD II
The person who tries to convince me again not to despair will become the second person to treat me poorly. Let my army go. England will be Bolingbroke’s very soon. 
##They exit.
##Wales, outside Flint Castle.
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, and NORTHUMBERLAND enter, with ceremonial flags and drums sounding. Several attendants and soldiers accompany them.
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
So we know from this latest news that the Welshmen have left the battlefield and that the king has landed with some of his friends on the coast, where Salisbury has gone to meet him. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
It’s good news, my lord. Richard is hiding not very far from here. 
###DUKE OF YORK
It would be better for Lord Northumberland to call him “King Richard.” We should mourn the day that a king has to hide. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Your grace misunderstands me. I only left off his title for the sake of brevity. 
###DUKE OF YORK
There was a time when, if you’d been so brief in his presence, he would have made you even briefer, by chopping off your head. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Uncle, don’t take this misunderstanding too far. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Good cousin, don’t take more than you should, or you may forget heaven rules over us. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I know it, uncle, and won’t oppose the will of heaven. But who is coming? 
## HENRY PERCY enters. 
Welcome, Harry. What, won’t this castle give in? 
###HENRY PERCY
The castle is guarded by royal soldiers, my lord, and they won’t let you enter. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Royal! But there’s no king here, is there? 
###HENRY PERCY
Yes, my lord, there is a king here. King Richard is inside, along with Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, Sir Stephen Scroop, as well a holy clergyman whom I don’t know. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
It’s probably the Bishop of Carlisle. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Noble lords, approach the crude walls of this old castle and let the trumpets sound a signal to the king that we want to meet. Deliver this message: Henry Bolingbroke kneels before King Richard, kisses his hand, and offers his loyalty and true faith of heart. I come to lay my weapons and my power at his feet, as long as he repeals my banishment and freely gives back all my lands. If he won’t, I’ll use my power to rain his Englishmen’s blood on the summer’s dust. By kneeling submissively before him I’ll show how little I desire to drench his green lands in this way. Go, tell him, and meanwhile we’ll march here on the plain. Let’s march without the drums so that they can clearly see our excellent military equipment from the castle’s ruined roof. I think King Richard and I should meet in the same way that lightning and rain mix in the sky, producing thunder that rips it apart. If he’s the lightning, I’ll be the rain. He can rage, while I will yield and pour my waters on the earth. But only on the earth, not on him. March along, and notice how King Richard looks. 
##They call from outside for a meeting, and someone answers from within. Trumpets blow. KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and EARL OF SALISBURY appear on the walls of the castle.
See, King Richard himself appears, just as the sun rises unhappily in the east when it sees the clouds covering the sky and trying to hide his rays. 
###DUKE OF YORK
He still looks like a king. Look, his eye is as bright as an eagle’s and commands authority. It would be a shame to harm his fair appearance! 
###KING RICHARD II
I am astonished that I’ve stood here waiting so long and you haven’t yet kneeled, 
##To NORTHUMBERLAND 
since I thought I was still your lawful king. And if I am, how dare you not kneel in my presence? If I am not, prove to me that God has dismissed me from my position. No mortal man, after all, can take away my scepter, unless he steals it or usurps it against the will of God. Even if you think that, like you, everyone has put their souls in danger by turning away from me, and that I have no friends, you should know that God, my master, is gathering disease and agony in his clouds on my behalf. They will strike the unborn children of anyone who raises their hands against me and the glory of my crown. Tell Bolingbroke—for I think he’s standing over there—that every step he takes on my land is a dangerous act of treason. He has come to wage war against me. But ten thousand sons will die, faithful Englishman’s blood will stain the pastures, and peace will turn to anger before he ever gets the crown he seeks. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
God forbid that anyone would attack the king! Your noble cousin Harry Bolingbroke kisses your hand. He swears by your grandfather’s grave, by the royal blood you share, by the buried hand of his father Gaunt, and by his own honor that he has no intention of doing anything but kneeling down and asking for his land and money back. Once you’ve given him that, he’ll commit to never use his weapons, to put his warhorses in stables, and to dedicate himself to your faithful service. He swears that this is fair to him as a prince. I, as a gentleman, believe him. 
###KING RICHARD II
Cousin, aren’t I dishonoring myself by looking so wretched and speaking so kindly? Should I call back Northumberland and tell him to send only words of defiance to the traitor—and in doing so ensure that Bolingbroke’s army will kill me? 


###DUKE OF AUMERLE
No, my good lord. Let’s do battle with gentle words until we’ve had time to gather our friends and their weapons. 
###KING RICHARD II
Oh, God! It’s unbelievable that after sentencing that proud man to banishment, I would now lift his punishment with soothing words! I wish that I were as great as I am a sad, or that I weren’t a king. I wish I could forget that I’ve been a king, and that I must act like a king now. Is my heart beating faster? I’ll let it beat faster, since my enemies have the ability to beat both my heart and me. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Northumberland is coming back from speaking to Bolingbroke. 
###KING RICHARD II
What must the king do now? Must the king surrender? He will do it. Must the king be overthrown? He will be happy. Must the king no longer be called king? In God’s name, he’ll renounce it. I’ll trade my jewels for a rosary, my gorgeous palace for a hermit’s dwelling, my nice clothes for a beggar’s shirt, my ornamented cups for a wooden dish, my scepter for a pilgrim’s cane, my subjects for a pair of carved saints, and trade my kingdom for a small and unmarked grave. Or bury me in a busy highway, where my subjects can trample my head constantly, since they are trampling my heart now while I’m still alive. Once I’m buried, why not trample on my head? Aumerle, my softhearted cousin, you are crying. We’ll use our tears to create violent storms, and with our sighs they will beat down the crops and cause famine in this rebellious land. Or shall we play with our woes and devise some clever game with our tears? We could keep them falling continually in one spot until they’ve carved us a pair of graves in the earth. We’d lie in the graves, and the tombstone would say “There lie two relatives who dug their graves with tears.” Wouldn’t that be a good game to play? Well, well, I speak foolishly, and you are laughing at me. My lord Northumberland, mighty prince, what does King Bolingbroke say? Will his majesty allow me to live until I die? You bow, and Bolingbroke decides. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord, he waits in the outer court below to speak with you. Will you come down? 
###KING RICHARD II
I’m coming down, like shining Phaeton unable to control unruly horses. In the bottom court? The bottom court, where kings become common enough to obey a traitor’s summons and bow to them. In the bottom court? Come down? The bottom court! And now the king is on the bottom! Everything is backward, and night owls shriek when mounting larks should be singing. 
##They exit from above. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
What does the king say? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
His sorrow makes him speak foolishly, like a mad man. But he’s coming. 
## KING RICHARD and his attendants enter below. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Stand apart, and show your duty to the king. 
##He kneels.
My gracious lord. 
###KING RICHARD II
Fair cousin, you insult your princely knee by touching it to the lowly earth. I’d rather my heart feel your love than my eyes see your fake courtesy. Get up, cousin. Your heart is proud, I know, even if your knee is humbled. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My gracious lord, I’m only here to reclaim my own property. 
###KING RICHARD II
Your property is yours, and I am your king. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My dreaded lord, you are my king only if I deserve your love. 
###KING RICHARD II
) Uncle, give me your hands. No, dry your eyes. Tears show love, but do nothing to fix their cause. () Cousin, I am too young to be your father, even though you are old enough to inherit my kingdom. I’ll willingly give you what you want, because you’ve forced me to do it. So now you’ll go to London, cousin? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Yes, my good lord. 
###KING RICHARD II
Then I can’t say no. 
##Trumpets blow. They exit. 
##The village of Langley, in the Duke of York’s garden.
##The QUEEN enters, with two Ladies. 
###QUEEN
What game should we play here in the garden to distract us from our worries? 
###LADY
Madam, let’s play bowls. 
###QUEEN
It will make me think the world is full of obstacles, and that my fortune sends me the wrong way. 
###LADY
Madam, we’ll dance. 
###QUEEN
My legs can’t move with delight when my heart is so full of grief. Therefore, no dancing, girl. Let’s find some other sport. 
###LADY
Madam, we’ll tell stories. 
###QUEEN
Sad ones or happy ones? 
###LADY
Either, madam. 
###QUEEN
Neither, girl. Since I have no happiness, happy stories only remind me of sorrow. Since I am full of grief, sad stories only add more sorrow to my lack of happiness. I don’t need to add on to what I already have, and it does no good to complain about what I want. 
###LADY
Madam, I’ll sing. 
###QUEEN
It’s wonderful that you are happy enough to sing, but it would make me happier if you wept. 
###LADY
If it would do you any good, madam, I could weep. 
###QUEEN
And if weeping would do me any good, I would do it enough that I’d be able to sing. 
##A Gardener enters, with two Servants. 
But stop, here come the gardeners. Let’s move into the shadows of these trees. I’d only bet my most worthless possessions that they won’t talk about politics, since that’s what everyone does in anticipation of a change. Sorrow is always announced with sorrow. 
##The QUEEN and her Ladies step into the background. 
###GARDENER
Go, gather up those dangling apricots. The tree is bending under their excessive weight, like a father oppressed by his unruly children. Give the twigs some support. Cut off the branches that are growing too fast and high in our country. Everything must be equal. While you’re doing that, I’ll go dig up those harmful weeds that are stealing all the nutrients in the soil from the flowers. 
###SERVANT
Why should we make this garden look like a model of beauty and order when the whole country is in disarray? If England were a garden, it would be full of weeds, with the most beautiful flowers choked to death. All the fruit trees would be torn out of the ground, the hedges would be ruined, the carefully designed flowerbeds would be a mess, and the herbs would be covered in caterpillars. 
###GARDENER
Be quiet. The one who allowed this disordered mess to grow is now withering like a tree in autumn. The weeds that he sheltered with his leaves, and that seemed to prop him up while simultaneously destroying him, have been ripped up by Bolingbroke. I’m talking about the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, and Green. 
###SERVANT
What, they are dead? 
###GARDENER
They are, and Bolingbroke has taken the wasteful king into custody. Oh, it’s too bad that the king didn’t take care of his land as carefully as we tend this garden! At this time of year we pierce the bark, so that the fruit trees aren’t spoiled by too much of their own rich sap. If he had done the same thing to his men, who were spoiling from too much wealth and power, they might have served him better, and he would have profited. We cut the unnecessary branches off the trees, so that the ones that bear fruit will live. If he had done the same and cut away the unnecessary men in his service, he would still have the crown. But he wasted his time and lost it. 
###SERVANT
What, do you think the king will be dethroned? 
###GARDENER
He’s already been brought low, and it’s feared he’ll be dethroned. A dear friend of the Duke of York received letters last night with bad news. 
###QUEEN
Oh, not saying anything is killing me! 
##She comes forward. 
You, gardener, how dare you say such awful things? What snake has tempted you to invent a second fall of man? Why do you say that King Richard is deposed? Do you dare predict his downfall when you are as low as the dirt? Tell me where, when, and how you heard these terrible things. Speak, you wretch. 
###GARDENER
Forgive me, madam. I’m not happy to say it, but it’s true. Bolingbroke has captured King Richard. Their fortunes are being weighed out. Your lord has only himself and his vanity, which makes him lighter. Great Bolingbroke has all the English peers with him, and that gives him greater weight than King Richard. If you hurry to London, you’ll see. I’m only saying what everyone knows. 
###QUEEN
Why am I the last to hear this bad news that concerns me? I’ll feel the sorrow the longest and yet I’m the last to know. Come, ladies, let’s go. We must go to London to see the king in his sorrow. Was this why I was born, to show my sad face while great Bolingbroke triumphs? Gardener, for telling me this awful news, I pray that your plants never grow. 
##The QUEEN and her Ladies exit. 
###GARDENER
Poor queen! I wish her curse would strike my skill if it would help her. Her tear fell right here. I’ll plant rue there, since it is a bitter and sad herb. If only out of pity, rue will soon grow here in remembrance of a weeping queen. 
##They exit.
##Westminster Hall.
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE enters, with the same ceremony as if he were entering Parliament. DUKE OF AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, and another lord enter as well, as do a herald, some officers, and BAGOT. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Call forward Bagot. Now, Bagot, speak freely. What do you know about noble Gloucester’s death? Who conspired with the king to do it, and who actually killed him? 
###BAGOT
Bring Lord Aumerle forward. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Cousin, stand in front and look at that man. 
###BAGOT
My Lord Aumerle, I know you’re too brave to deny what you’ve already said. While Gloucester’s death was being plotted, I heard you say, “Isn’t my arm long enough to reach from the peaceful English court to Calais, to strike at my uncle’s head?” At that same time, I heard you say, among other things, that you would rather refuse a hundred thousand crowns than have Bolingbroke return to England. And you added that the country would be blessed if Bolingbroke, your cousin, died. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Princes and noble lords, how should I respond to this lowly man? Should I dishonor my rank as a noble by chastising him on equal terms? I guess I must, or let him ruin my honor with this slanderous accusation. There is my glove, the symbol of your death. I say you lie, and I’ll confirm in combat that what you said is a lie, though I won’t stain my knightly sword with your common blood. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Bagot, restrain yourself. You will not retaliate. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Except for Bolingbroke, I wish Bagot were the most noble person here to have angered me like this. 
###LORD FITZWATER
If your courage depends on rank, there is my glove, Aumerle, to match your glove. I swear by the sun that shows me where you are that I heard you boast that you caused Gloucester’s death. Even if you deny it twenty times, you lie, and I’ll put that lie back in your heart, where it came from, with my sword. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Coward, you wouldn’t dare do it. 
###LORD FITZWATER
By my soul, I wish I could do it right now. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Fitzwater, you’ll be damned to hell for this. 
###HENRY PERCY
Aumerle, you lie. His accusation is as true as your denial is false. And I’ll prove that you lie by throwing down my glove. Take it up, if you dare. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
If I don’t, may my hands rot away and never again lift my sword over the helmet of my enemy! 
###LORD
I’ll throw down my glove to you, too, lying Aumerle. And I’ll accuse you of lying right in your ear, from sunrise to sunset. There’s my pledge of honor. Pick it up, if you dare. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Who else challenges me? By heaven, I’ll throw my glove at you all. My breast holds a thousand spirits that can outmatch twenty thousand like you. 
###DUKE OF SURREY
My lord Fitzwater, I remember very well when you and Aumerle spoke. 
###LORD FITZWATER
That’s true, you were there. And you can be my witness that this is true. 
###DUKE OF SURREY
It’s as false as heaven is true. 
###LORD FITZWATER
Surrey, you lie. 
###DUKE OF SURREY
Dishonorable boy! Your lie will give such weight to my sword that it will attack you in revenge until you’re lying in the grave as quiet as your dead father. As proof, there’s my glove. Take it up, if you dare. 
###LORD FITZWATER
You taunt me so foolishly! As easily as I dare to eat or drink or breathe or live, I dare to meet Surrey in a wild place and spit on him, all the while declaring that he lies. There is my response, so that you can’t run away from it. I intend to do well in this new kingdom, and Aumerle is guilty. Besides, I heard the banished Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, say that you, Aumerle, sent two of your men to kill the noble duke at Calais. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Someone lend me a glove so I can prove that Mowbray lies. Here, I throw down this, so that I may test his honor if he’s ever brought back. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
All these quarrels will be put on hold until Mowbray is recalled from exile, as he will be. Even though he is my enemy, he’ll be given back his land and titles. And when he comes back, we’ll have his trial against Aumerle. 
###BISHOP OF CARLISLE
That day will never happen. Many times did Mowbray fight for Jesus Christ in battle and raised the Christian cross against the black pagans, Turks, and Saracens. Exhausted by war, he retired to Italy. He gave his body to its soil in Venice and gave his pure soul to Christ, under whose banner he fought for so long. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Why, bishop, is Mowbray dead? 
###BISHOP OF CARLISLE
As surely as I am alive, my lord. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
May peace take his sweet soul to Abraham! Lords, we’ll keep all these challenges until we can set days for your trials. 
##The DUKE OF YORK enters, with his attendants. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to you from humbled Richard, who is willing to make you his heir and yields his royal scepter to your hands. Take his throne from him, and long live Henry, the fourth king with that name! 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
In God’s name, I’ll take the royal throne. 
###BISHOP OF CARLISLE
God forbid! I’m the least worthy to speak in this noble company, but it’s fitting that I, a clergyman, speak the truth. If only one of the nobles here were noble enough to judge Richard! Then he would restrain himself from committing such a wrong. What subject can pass judgment on his king? And who here isn’t Richard’s subject? Even thieves aren’t judged unless they’re present, even when they’re obviously guilty. Shall the image of God’s majesty, who is His chosen deputy and caretaker and has been so for many years, be judged by his inferiors without even being present? Oh, God, don’t allow such refined souls in a Christian land to be so obscene. I’m speaking to subjects as a subject, because I’ve been moved by God to speak boldly for his king. You might call my Lord of Hereford here king, but he is a traitor to his king. If you give him the crown, I predict that the blood of the English will soak the soil, and future generations will regret this act. Peace will leave England and go to the Turks and infidels, while we will have terrible wars that will pit families against each other. Disorder, fear, mutiny, and horror will live here, and it will be known as a place of terror and skulls. If you pit your family against his, it will prove to be the worst division ever to take place on earth. Prevent it from happening. Don’t let it be so, or your children and your grandchildren will lament your actions! 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
You’ve argued well, and in return we’re arresting you for capital treason. My Lord of Westminster, it’s your responsibility to keep him safe until he goes on trial. My lords, please grant the commons’ suit. 
###HENRY OF BOLINGBROKE
Bring Richard here, so that he can surrender in public. That way I can proceed without suspicion. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I’ll escort him. 
##He exits. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
You lords who are here under arrest, arrange for someone to pledge that you’ll be here for your trial. I don’t owe you anything, and I don’t expect to receive any love from you. 
##The DUKE OF YORK enters with KING RICHARD II. Officers follow them holding the crown and the scepter, the symbols of the kingship. 
###KING RICHARD II
Alas, why does the king call for me when I’ve only just resigned myself to give up the throne? I’ve hardly had time to learn to act like a subject, who has to indulge the king and bow to him. Give me some time with my sorrow so that I can learn how to submit to another. I still remember how these men used to serve me. Didn’t they once cry out, “All hail!” to me? But then so did Judas to Christ once. But Christ had eleven honest followers out of twelve. I don’t have one out of twelve thousand. God save the king! Won’t anyone say amen? Do I have to both give the blessing and affirm it? Well then, amen. God save the king! Even though I am not the king. And yet, I’ll say amen in case heaven still considers me the king. Why have you sent for me? 
###DUKE OF YORK
You have to give up your country and your crown to Henry Bolingbroke of your own free will, even though you’ve already given it over through your defeat. 
###KING RICHARD II
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, take the crown. Here cousin. I’ll put my hand on this side of it, and you put yours on the other. Now this golden crown looks like a well that has two buckets, and raising one causes the other to drop and fill up. One is empty and dances up in the air, while the other is down in the well and full of water. I’m the bucket at the bottom, full of tears, and you are the one risen to the top. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I thought you were willing to give up the crown. 
###KING RICHARD II
I’m willing to give up my crown, but my sadness is still mine. You can take my glory and my royal status, but I still rule over my grief. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
You’ll lose some of those worries when you give the crown to me. 
###KING RICHARD II
Just because you gain those worries doesn’t mean I lose them. I’m worried by their loss and by what has happened. Your concern is the new responsibilities you are taking on. I’ll keep my worries even if I give away their cause, the crown. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Are you willing to give up the crown? 
###KING RICHARD II
Yes and no. No and yes, since I must not be anything. So, no, no, because I give it up to you. Now look, I’ll make myself nothing. I’ll give you this heavy crown from my head, and this scepter from my hand. I’ll take the pride of being king out of my heart. My own tears will wash away the oil that made me king. My own hands will give away the crown. My own tongue will deny my sacred right to be king. My own breath will give up all oaths of allegiance made to me. I give up all the ritual and ceremony, all my homes, my income, and reject all the laws I enacted. May God pardon everyone who breaks his oath to me! May God keep them from breaking their oath to you! Let me grieve for nothing since I have nothing, and let you be pleased with everything since you have everything! May you live long in my place, and let me be buried soon! God save King Harry, former King Richard says, and let him have many happy days! What else is left? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Nothing but for you to read aloud all the accusations and crimes that you and your followers committed against the wellbeing and prosperity of this country. Once you’ve confessed, everyone can agree that you’ve been justly dethroned. 
###KING RICHARD II
Do I have to? Do I have to list out these charges? Dear Northumberland, if all your crimes were listed out, wouldn’t you be ashamed to read them in front of such a distinguished group? If you did, you’d find on the list the terrible crime of deposing a king and breaking an oath, crimes condemned by heaven. All of you who are watching me act out my miserable fate here pretend like Pilate that you’ve done nothing wrong and look at me with pity. But you’ve all played a part in bringing me to this state, and you can’t deny your sin. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord, get on with it. Read the charges. 
###KING RICHARD II
My eyes are full of tears and I can’t see. But even so, I can see a group of traitors in front of me. And if I look at myself, I see just as great a traitor. I’ve agreed to give up my royal garments, made nobility common, and made a master a slave. I’ve made a king a subject and made the richest the poorest. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord— 
###KING RICHARD II
I’m not your lord, you haughty, insulting man. I’m no man’s lord. I don’t have a name or a title. The name I was baptized with is no longer mine. How sad it is that I am so old and I don’t know what to call myself! If only I were a snowman, I could stand in front of the sun of Bolingbroke and let myself be melted! Good king, great king, but not a very good man. If my commands still have value in England, let me command someone to bring me a mirror, so I may see what I look like without any of my noble majesty. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Someone go and get a mirror. 
##An attendant exits. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Read this paper until the mirror arrives. 
###KING RICHARD II
Fiend, you are torturing me before I even get to hell! 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Lord Northumberland, stop asking him to read it. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
The House of Commons won’t be satisfied. 
###KING RICHARD II
They’ll get what they want. I’ll read it when I can look at my face and see the sins that appear there. 
##The attendant reenters with a mirror.
Give me the mirror, and I’ll read what’s on my face. No deeper wrinkles yet? Could I endure so many sorrows without them appearing on my face? Oh flattering mirror, you are lying to me just like my followers did during happier times. Was this the same man who once kept ten thousand men in his employ? Was this the face that made men lower their gaze, as if they were looking into the sun? Was this the same face that endured so many challenges until it was defeated by Bolingbroke? There’s a fragile glory in this face, and it’s a face as fragile as glory. 
##He throws the mirror on the ground.
Look, there it is in a hundred pieces. Pay attention, king, to what this means. Sorrow has so quickly destroyed my face. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
It’s only the outward gloom of your sorrow that has destroyed the appearance of your face. 
###KING RICHARD II
Say that again. The outward gloom of my sorrow! Ha! Let’s see. It’s true that my grief is inside me and that anything I say or do to indicate my grief is just the outward reflection of what’s inside. Thank you, king, for being so kind as to not only give me reason to grieve but also to teach me how to show my grief. I’ll beg one favor, and then I’ll go away and no longer bother you. Will you give it to me? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Whatever you want, fair cousin. 
###KING RICHARD II
“Fair cousin”? I must be mightier than a king, since when I was a king subjects flattered me, but now that I’m a subject the king flatters me. Since I’m so mighty, I don’t need to beg. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Ask anyway. 
###KING RICHARD II
And will I have it? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
You will. 
###KING RICHARD II
Then give me permission to go. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Where? 
###KING RICHARD II
Wherever you want, as long as it is away from you. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Go, some of you take him to the tower. 
###KING RICHARD II
Oh good! Take me? You’re all takers who’ve risen so mightily by my downfall. 
## KING RICHARD II exits, with some lords and a guard. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Next Wednesday, I’ll be crowned. Lords, prepare for it. 
##They all exit, except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, and the DUKE OF AUMERLE. 
###ABBOT
This is a sad scene we’ve witnessed. 
###BISHOP OF CARLISLE
The sadness is yet to come. Children who aren’t even born yet will feel the effects of this day like a thorn in their side. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
You holy men, isn’t there a way we can get rid of this terrible ruler? 
###ABBOT
My lord, before I speak freely, you must swear to keep this a secret and also to promise that whatever plan I come up with is carried out. I see how unhappy you are. Come home with me for supper. I’ll put forward a plot that will make us all happy. 
##They exit.
##London. A street leading to the Tower of London.
##The QUEEN and ladies enter. 
###QUEEN
The king will come this way as he is taken to the tower, where proud Bolingbroke condemned him to be held a prisoner. Let’s rest here, if there is anywhere on this rebellious earth where I can rest. 
## KING RICHARD II and guards enter. 
But wait, but look, or rather don’t look or you will wither. No, but look up, and let pity wash over you and your tears of love bathe him. Ah, you, fallen in greatness like Troy, the epitome of honor. You look like a shell of King Richard and not King Richard himself. Oh, why should grief live in you, who are so honorable and royal, while triumph lives within Bolingbroke, a commoner? 
###KING RICHARD II
Fair lady, don’t grieve as if I were already dead. Think of our past as a happy dream and that we have simply awoken to reality. I’ve had to bow to necessity, and I’ll stay that way until I die. Go quickly to France and join a convent. Our only hope is to become holy and be crowned in heaven, since our lives here have ended in such ruin. 
###QUEEN
What, has my Richard been changed and weakened in both body and mind? Has Bolingbroke overthrown your mind? Has he turned your heart? The dying lion claws at the earth, if nothing else, in his rage at being defeated. Will you act like a rebuked student and take your punishment meekly, kiss the cane that beats you, and return rage with humility, when you are a lion and king of beasts? 
###KING RICHARD II
A king of beasts, indeed. If only they weren’t beasts, I would still be a happy king of men. Good former queen, get ready to go to France. Think of me as dead, and say goodbye to me now as if I were on my deathbed. Through long winter nights sit by the fire with good people and let them tell you stories of sad times long ago. And before you say good night, tell them my sadder story and send them weeping to their beds. Even the firewood will sympathize and cry out their fires. And some will be so unhappy at the story of the overthrow of a rightful king that they will cover themselves in ashes. 
## NORTHUMBERLAND and others enter. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord, Bolingbroke has changed his mind. You must go to Pomfret instead of the tower. And madam, he’s made arrangements for you to go to France as quickly as possible. 
###KING RICHARD II
Northumberland, Bolingbroke is mounting my throne on your ladder, but it won’t take very long until you turn against each other. You’ll think that even though he gives you half the kingdom, it’s not enough, since you helped him get it all. And he’ll think that you, who knows how to put undeserving kings in the throne, will know how to remove him from the stolen throne. Wicked men’s love soon turns to fear, then to hate, and from there one or both of them will become dangerous and die a violent death. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
My guilt is on my own head, and that’s an end to it. Say goodbye and separate, for you must depart shortly. 
###KING RICHARD II
Twice divorced! You force me to divorce my crown and now my wife. I can’t undo with a kiss the vows that bound us together, because they were sealed with a kiss. Separate us, Northumberland. I’ll go to the north, where cold and sickness afflict the region. And my wife goes to France, from where she came with celebration like the spring, and now is sent back like the dead of winter. 
###QUEEN
And do we have to be separated? 
###KING RICHARD II
Yes, my love, our hands and our hearts must be divided. 
###QUEEN
Banish us both, and send the king with me. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
That might be an act of love, but it’s not a smart policy. 
###QUEEN
Then wherever he goes, let me follow him. 
###KING RICHARD II
So the two of us together will make one big sorrow. Weep for me in France, and I’ll weep for you here. It’s better for us to be far away than near, and never near each other again. Go measure the distance in sighs, and I’ll do the same with groans. 
###QUEEN
So the farther I go, the longer I will moan. 
###KING RICHARD II
Since my way is shorter, I’ll groan twice for every step I take and make the way longer with a sad heart. Come, let’s cut short this talk of grief, because we’ll have long enough to live with it. Let’s kiss once and quiet our mouths and part without any more words. I give you my heart and take yours with me. 
###QUEEN
Give me my heart back. It will only kill your heart if I take it. So now that I have my own heart back, go, so I can try to kill my own with mourning. 
###KING RICHARD II
We’re only encouraging sorrow with this delay. Once more, goodbye. My grief will say the rest. 
##They exit. 
##The DUKE OF YORK’s palace.
##The DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHESS OF YORK enter. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest of the story about our two relatives coming to London, until weeping made you stop. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Where did I stop the story? 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
At the sad place, my lord, when rude hands were throwing dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head from the upper windows. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke, got on a magnificent horse that seemed to know it was him and kept going in a slow and stately way. All around, people were calling, “God save you, Bolingbroke!” You would have thought the windows themselves were talking. Both old and young people were looking out on him with happy desire, and on the painted walls all around was written, “Jesus protect you! Welcome, Bolingbroke!” Meanwhile, he was turning his head, bare of any helmet and not even as tall as his horse’s neck, and said, “I thank you, countrymen.” And he continued along saying this as he went. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Alas, poor Richard? Where was he riding then? 
###DUKE OF YORK
People looked at him with the dissatisfaction they might have for a supporting actor who comes on stage after the star has left. They stared at him with contempt, and no one cried out, “God save him!” No one welcomed him back. Instead, they threw dust on his sacred head. He shook it off with gentle sorrow, while he both cried and smiled as he wrestled with grief and patience. For some reason God must have hardened everyone’s hearts, otherwise they would have melted so that even a barbarian would have pitied him. But heaven has ordered all this, and we must follow its will. We are Bolingbroke’s subjects now, and I must forever acknowledge his rule and honor. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Here comes my son Aumerle. 
###DUKE OF YORK
He was Duke of Aumerle, but because he was Richard’s friend, he has lost his title. You must call him Rutland now. I’ve sworn in Parliament that he will honor and obey our new king. 
##The DUKE OF AUMERLE enters. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Welcome, my son. Who are the new favorites of the king? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Madam, I don’t know and I don’t care. God knows I prefer just as much not to be one. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Well, hold yourself upright in this new regime, or you’ll die before your time. What’s the news from Oxford? Are the jousts and festivities happening? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
For all I know they are. 
###DUKE OF YORK
You will be there, I know. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
I mean to, unless God prevents it. 
###DUKE OF YORK
What is the note that I see in your shirt? You’ve just gone white. Let me see what it says. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
My lord, it’s nothing. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Then it doesn’t matter who sees it. I want to see it, and I will. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
I beg you to forgive me. It’s a small matter, but one that I don’t want to share for certain reasons. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I want to see it because of those reasons. I fear— 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
What should you fear? It’s just a bill for some festive clothing for the celebration. 
###DUKE OF YORK
A bill that he’s wearing so close to himself! Wife, you are a fool. Boy, let me see what it says. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
I beg you, forgive me. I can’t show you. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I will see it. 
##He grabs it and reads it. 
Treason! Foul treason! Villain! Traitor! Slave! 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
What is the matter, my lord? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Hey, who is inside? 
##A servant enters. 
Saddle my horse. God have mercy, what treachery is this! 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Why, what is it, my lord? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Give me my boots and saddle my horse. Now, by my honor, my life, and my vow, I will accuse the villain. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
What’s the matter? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Be quiet, foolish woman. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
I won’t be quiet. What is the matter, Aumerle? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Good mother, don’t worry. It is something that I have to answer with my own life. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Answer with your life! 
###DUKE OF YORK
Bring me my boots. I must go to the king. 
##The servant enters, carrying boots. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Hit him, Aumerle! Poor boy, you are distraught. Go away, villain! Don’t come back. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Give me my boots, I say. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Why, York, what are you going to do? Won’t you hide the crime of your own child? Do we have any other sons? Are we likely to have more? Aren’t I too old to have children? And are you going to take away my son in my old age, so I can no longer call myself a mother? Doesn’t he look like you? Isn’t he your son? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Foolish madwoman, will you try to cover up this terrible conspiracy? A dozen have sworn and signed here that they’ll kill the king at Oxford. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
He won’t be one of them. We’ll keep him here, and then what will this affair have to do with him? 
###DUKE OF YORK
Get away, foolish woman! Even if he were my son twenty times over, I would accuse him. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
If you had gone through labor with him as I had, you would be more sorrowful. But now I know what you think. You think that I’ve cheated on you, and that he’s a bastard and not your son. Sweet York, my sweet husband, don’t think that way. He looks as much like you as anyone could. He doesn’t look anything like me, or like anyone in my family, but I still love him. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Make way, you wild woman! 
##He exits. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Go after him, Aumerle! Take his horse, get to the king before him, and beg forgiveness before he can even accuse you. I’ll be right behind. Though I am old, I can ride as fast as York. I’ll prostrate myself before the king until he has forgiven you. Go on! 
##They exit. 
##A royal palace.
## HENRY BOLINGBROKE, HENRY PERCY, and other lords enter. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Can’t anyone tell me about my irresponsible son? It’s been three months since I last saw him. He’s the only trouble in my life. I want him found. Ask in London, around the bars there. They say he goes to them every day with immoral friends, the kind of people who ambush passersby in the street and beat and rob the guards. My pleasure-seeking son thinks it’s a badge of honor to support such an awful crowd. 
###HENRY PERCY
My lord, two days ago I saw the prince and told him about the celebration at Oxford. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
And what did he say? 
###HENRY PERCY
He said that he would go to the whorehouse and get a glove from the most promiscuous whore there to wear as a favor. And then he would win in the jousts. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Even if he is immoral and reckless, I still see some hope that his better qualities will emerge as he gets older. But who is approaching? 
##The DUKE OF AUMERLE enters. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Where is the king? 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Why does my cousin stare and look about him so wildly? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
God save your grace! I beg to speak to you alone. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Go away, and leave us here alone. 
## HENRY PERCY and lords exit.
What is the matter with you now? 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
May my knees remain on the ground and my tongue stay silent until you give me your forgiveness. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Is it an offense that you have committed or that you planned to commit? If it was planned only, no matter how terrible it is, I’ll forgive you in order to win your love. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Then let me lock the door so no one else can come in until I’m finished telling you. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Go ahead. 
###DUKE OF YORK
(speaking from off-stage) My lord, beware. Watch yourself. You have a traitor with you. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Villain, I’ll render you harmless. 
##He draws his sword. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Hold off from your revenge. You don’t have any reason to be afraid. 
###DUKE OF YORK
(speaking from off-stage) Open the door, my foolish king. Should I harshly criticize you out of love for you? Open the door, or I’ll break it down. 
##The DUKE OF YORK enters. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
What is the matter, uncle? Tell me. Catch your breath. Tell me how close the danger is so that I can prepare for it. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Read this, and you’ll know what treason made me hurry so fast that I can hardly speak. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
Remember, as you read, what you just promised. I already regret it. Don’t read my name there. My heart doesn’t match what my hand wrote. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Villain, your heart believed it before your hand wrote it. I took the paper from the traitor, king. He regrets it out of fear, not out of love for you. Don’t pity him, because that pity will come back to harm you. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Oh, what a terrible and bold conspiracy! Oh, loyal father of a treacherous son! Your pure goodness overwhelms the wrongdoing of your foul son. Because you have proven yourself so loyal, I’ll forgive your son’s damnable crime. 
###DUKE OF YORK
So my virtue will pay for his vice, and as some bad sons spend all their fathers’ money, he’ll spend all my honor with his shame. My honor can only live if his dishonor dies, otherwise I will live in shame. By forgiving him you are killing me. If he lives, so does a traitor, and the loyal man is put to death. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
(speaking from off-stage) Hello, my lord! For God’s sake, let me in. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
What screeching beggar is there? 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
A woman and your aunt, great king. It’s me. Please pity me. Open the door and talk to me. I, who have never begged before, am now a beggar. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Suddenly the scene has changed from something serious to “The Beggar and the King.” My dangerous cousin, let your mother in. I know that she’s come to beg forgiveness for your terrible crime. 
###DUKE OF YORK
No matter who prays, if you forgive this crime, only more will follow. By cutting off this infected limb you’ll keep the rest of the body healthy. It’s the only way to keep this sickness from spreading. 
##The DUCHESS OF YORK enters. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Oh, king, don’t believe this hardhearted man! If he can’t love his son, he is incapable of loving anyone. 
###DUKE OF YORK
You crazy woman, what are you doing here? Are you going to nurse another traitor with your old breasts? 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Sweet York, be patient. Gentle king, listen to me. 
##She kneels. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Get up, good aunt. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Not yet, I beg you. I’ll stay on my knees and never look up again until you give me joy by forgiving Rutland, my wayward son. 
###DUKE OF AUMERLE
I’ll kneel, too, in support of my mother’s prayers. 
###DUKE OF YORK
I’ll kneel to oppose them. If you forgive him, you’ll only nurture more bad deeds. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Is he serious? Look at his face. He’s not crying. His prayers are a joke. His words come from his mouth, but ours come from our hearts. He prays softly, hoping to be denied. We pray with heart and soul and all our bodies. I know his old and tired knees would like to straighten up. We’ll stay kneeling till our knees grow roots in the ground. His prayers are hypocritical, while ours are full of true desire and integrity. Our prayers are more prayer-like than his, so let our prayers be rewarded as they ought to be, with mercy. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Good aunt, stand up. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
No, don’t say, “Stand up.” First say, “I forgive,” and then you can tell me to stand up. If I were your nanny, the first word I would teach you would be “pardon.” I’ve never wanted to hear a word so badly. Say “pardon,” king. Let pity teach you how. The word is short and sweeter than it is short. It’s the most fitting word for a king to say. 
###DUKE OF YORK
Say it in French, king. Say, “Pardonne moi.” 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Do you try to destroy forgiveness by teaching that pardon? Oh, my sour husband, my hardhearted lord, you’d make that word the opposite of what it means. Say “pardon” in English. We don’t understand French. I can see it in your eyes, so let your tongue say it. Listen to the pity in your heart with your ears, which our laments and prayers pierce, so that pity may move you to say “pardon.” 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Good aunt, stand up. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
I’m not begging to stand. All I want is a pardon. 
###HENRY OF BOLINGBROKE
I pardon him, as God will one day pardon me. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Oh, the happy view from a bended knee! But I’m still fearful. Say it again. Saying it twice doesn’t divide your pardon and weaken it but makes the one pardon stronger. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
With all my heart, I pardon him. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
You are a god on earth. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
But my trusted brother-in-law, the abbot, and all the rest of that group of conspirators must be destroyed. Good uncle, send several men to Oxford or wherever these traitors are hiding. I swear that as long as they are alive, I will find them and capture them. Uncle, goodbye, and goodbye cousin, too. Your mother has prayed well and proved your loyalty. 
###DUCHESS OF YORK
Come, my son. I’ll pray that God forces you to reform. 
##They exit. 
##The same palace.
## EXTON and a Servant enter. 
###EXTON
Didn’t you notice the king and hear what he said? “Don’t I have any friends who will rid me of this constant fear?” Didn’t he say that? 
###SERVANT
Those were his exact words. 
###EXTON
Twice he said, “Don’t I have any friends?” didn’t he? 
###SERVANT
He did. 
###EXTON
And when he said it, he looked at me intently, as if he were saying, “I wish you were the man who would take this fear away from me.” He means the king at Pomfret. Come, let’s go. I am the king’s friend, and I’ll get rid him of his enemy. 
##They exit. 
##The castle at Pomfret.
## KING RICHARD enters. 
###KING RICHARD II
I have been thinking about how I might compare this prison I live in to the world. But because the world is full of people and I’m the only one here, I cannot do it. Yet I’ll work it out. My brain and my soul will produce enough thoughts to fill this little world, like people in the outside world and just as discontented. The better kind of thought, like the thought of divine things, is mixed with doubts and compares passages from scripture, like “Come, little ones” and “It is as hard for a rich man to enter heaven as for a camel to pass through a needle’s eye.” Ambitious thoughts plot unlikely miracles, such as digging through the walls of my cell by hand, and these thoughts die in their prime because they are futile. Contented thoughts tell themselves that they aren’t the first to be a slave to fortune, and they won’t be the last. They’re like beggars in the stocks who take comfort in the fact that others have already sat there and more will sit there. So I host many people inside my own head, and none are content. Sometimes I’m king, and then some treason makes me wish I was a beggar, and so then I am a beggar. Then terrible poverty persuades me that I was better off as king, so then I am king again. And then I think that I have been dethroned by Bolingbroke, and suddenly I’m nothing. But whatever I am, just like all men, I’ll never be happy until I am dead and nothing at all. Do I hear music? 
##Music plays.
Ha! Keep time. How awful music is when they don’t keep time and the notes’ proportions are ruined. It’s the same thing in men’s lives. And here I can chastise the poor time kept on an out-of-tune instrument, when in the harmony of my government and life I couldn’t hear my own time breaking. I wasted time then, and now time wastes me. Time has made me his clock: my thoughts have become minutes that turn the clock hands in my eyes, and my finger is the dial that wipes away my tears. Now, sir, my groans are like the sounds that toll the hours, and they’re made by striking my heart, which is the bell. Thus my sighs, tears, and groans signify minutes and hours. Meanwhile, my time speeds on as Bolingbroke has his joy, and I’m left here playing the clock for him. This music makes me crazy. Let it stop. It might make madmen sane, but for me, it makes a wise man mad. Yet bless the heart that plays it for me! It’s a sign of love, and I am seldom given love in this hateful world. 
##Enter a Groom of the stable. 
###GROOM
Hello, royal prince! 
###KING RICHARD II
Thanks, my noble peer. You overvalue me, for we are equals and worth the same. Who are you, and how have you come here? My only visitor is that man who keeps my misfortune alive by bringing me food. 
###GROOM
I was a poor groom in your stable, king, when you were king. I was traveling toward York, and after a great deal of trouble I got permission to see my former master’s face. Oh, how it saddened me when I saw Bolingbroke ride into London that coronation day on Barbary, the horse you’ve ridden so often and which I’d so often made ready for you! 
###KING RICHARD II
Did he ride on Barbary? Tell me, dear friend, how did the horse do? 
###GROOM
He pranced as proudly as if he scorned the earth. 
###KING RICHARD II
So proud to have Bolingbroke on his back! He had eaten bread from my hand, and I made him proud by patting his neck. Shouldn’t he stumble? Shouldn’t he fall down and break the neck of the man that stole my throne? I forgive you, horse! Why should I curse you, since you were created to fear man and carry him. I was not made like a horse, but I carry a burden like a donkey, and I’m kicked and exhausted from carrying rough-riding Bolingbroke. 
##The Keeper enters, with a dish. 
###KEEPER
Fellow, go away. You can’t stay any longer. 
###KING RICHARD II
If you love me, you should go. 
###GROOM
I don’t dare say what my heart feels. 
##He exits. 
###KEEPER
My lord, will you eat? 
###KING RICHARD II
Taste it first, as you usually do. 
###KEEPER
My lord, I don’t dare. Sir Pierce of Exton, who just arrived from the king, ordered me not to. 
###KING RICHARD II
May the devil take Henry of Lancaster and you! I am tired of being patient. 
##He beats the Keeper. 
###KEEPER
Help, help, help! 
## EXTON and servants enter, with weapons. 
###KING RICHARD II
Do you mean to kill me in this despicable assault? Villain, I’ll kill you with your own weapon. 
##He snatches an axe from a servant and kills him. 
Go to hell. 
##He kills another, and then Exton strikes him down. 
You’ll burn in hell forever for killing me. Exton, you’ve stained the king’s land with the king’s own blood. Arise my soul! Your place is in heaven, while my body sinks down and dies. 
##He dies. 
###EXTON
He is as full of courage as of royal blood, which I’ve spilled here. I wish the deed were good! The devil, who told me that I did well, tells me now that I’ll go to hell. I’ll take this dead king to the living king and bury the others here. 
##They exit. 
##Windsor Castle.
##Trumpets blow. HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, and other lords and attendants enter. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Kind uncle York, the last news I heard is that the rebels have burned down the town of Cirencester in Gloucestershire. But I haven’t heard if they’ve been captured or killed. 
## NORTHUMBERLAND enters.
Welcome, my lord. What’s the news? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
First, I wish you happiness. Next, I’ve sent the heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent to London. This paper tells how they were taken. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I thank you, gentle Percy, for your effort. I’ll reward you well, as you deserve. 
## LORD FITZWATER enters.
###LORD FITZWATER
My lord, I’ve sent the heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely from Oxford to London. They were two of the traitors who wanted to overthrow you at Oxford. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
I won’t forget your efforts, Fitzwater. I know that you deserve your noble title. 
## HENRY PERCY and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE enter. 
###HENRY PERCY
The Abbot of Westminster, who conspired against you, has died. But here is Carlisle, alive, to hear your judgment on him. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Carlisle, here is your sentence: pick some secret place where you can live out your life in peace and die without violence. Even though you’ve always been my enemy, I’ve seen that you are a man of great honor. 
## EXTON enters, with several people carrying a coffin. 
###EXTON
Great king, here is your greatest fear now buried inside this coffin. In it lies without breathing your greatest enemy, Richard of Bordeaux, brought here by me. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Exton, I don’t thank you. By killing him, you’ve done a disgrace to my name and to our country. 
###EXTON
I did this on your own command. 
###HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Those who need to poison someone still don’t love poison. Even though I wanted him dead, I hate the man who murdered him, and now I love the man who has been murdered. You can take your guilty conscience as payment. I won’t give you any praise or royal favors. Go wander the night like Cain, and don’t show your face here again. 
## EXTON and his men exit.
Lords, I protest. My soul is full of sorrow that blood has been shed to make me more secure. Come, mourn with me and dress yourselves in black immediately. I’ll travel to the Holy Land to wash away this blood from my guilty hands. March sadly behind me, and weep for this untimely death. 
##They exit.


## RODERIGO and IAGO enter.
###RODERIGO
Come on, don’t tell me that. I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago. All this time I’ve thought you were such a good friend that I’ve let you spend my money as if it was yours. 
###IAGO
Damn it, you’re not listening to me! I never dreamed this was happening—if you find out I did, you can go ahead and hate me. 
###RODERIGO
You told me you hated him. 
###IAGO
I do hate him, I swear. Three of Venice’s most important noblemen took their hats off to him and asked him humbly to make me his lieutenant, the second in command. And I know my own worth well enough to know I deserve that position. But he wants to have things his own way, so he sidesteps the issue with a lot of military talk and refuses their request. “I’ve already chosen my lieutenant,” he says. And who does he choose? A guy who knows more about numbers than fighting! This guy from Florence named Michael Cassio. He has a pretty wife but he can’t even control her. And he’s definitely never commanded men in battle. He’s got no more hands-on knowledge of warfare than an old woman—unless you count what he’s read in books, 
which any peace-lover can do. His military understanding is all theory, no practice. But Cassio’s been chosen over me. My career is cut short by some bookkeeper, even though the general saw my fighting skills first-hand in Rhodes and Cyprus. This accountant is now lieutenant, while I end up as the Moor’s flag-bearer. 
###RODERIGO
By God, I’d rather be his executioner. 
###IAGO
And there’s nothing I can do about it. That’s the curse of military service. You get promoted when someone likes you, not because you’re next in line. Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor? 
###RODERIGO
If you don’t like him you should quit. 
###IAGO
No, calm down. I’m serving under him to take advantage of him. We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed. Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated. They ought to be whipped for being so stupid. But then there’s another kind of servant who looks dutiful and devoted, but who’s really looking out for himself. By pretending to serve their lords, these men get rich, and when they’ve saved up enough they can be their own masters. Guys like that have soul, and that’s the kind of guy I am. Let me tell 
you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago. I may seem to love and obey him, but in fact, I’m just serving him to get what I want. If my outward appearance started reflecting what I really felt, soon enough I’d be wearing my heart on my sleeve for birds to peck at. No, it’s better to hide it. I’m not who I appear to be. 
###RODERIGO
Thick-lips sure is lucky if he can pull this off! 
###IAGO
Let’s shout up to Desdemona’s father, wake him, pester him, spoil his happiness, spread rumors about him in the streets, enrage his relatives, and irritate him endlessly. However real his happiness is, it will vanish in light of this. 
###RODERIGO
Here’s her father’s house. I’ll call out. 
###IAGO
Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire. 
###RODERIGO
Hey, Brabantio! Signor Brabantio, hey! 
###IAGO
Wake up, Brabantio! Wake up! Thieves! Thieves! Check on your daughter, your house, your money! Thieves! Thieves! 
## BRABANTIO enters, above.
###BRABANTIO
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting? What’s the matter? 
###RODERIGO
Sir, is everyone in your family at home? 
###IAGO
Are your doors locked? 
###BRABANTIO
Why are you asking me that? 
###IAGO
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed. Get dressed. Your heart’s going to break. It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out. At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb. Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens. If you wait too long you’ll have black grandchildren. Get up, I tell you! 
###BRABANTIO
Are you crazy? 
###RODERIGO
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord? 
###BRABANTIO
Not me. Who are you? 
###RODERIGO
My name’s Roderigo. 
###BRABANTIO
I told you not to hang around my house. I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you. Now you come here drunk to make trouble and startle me out of a sound sleep? 
###RODERIGO
Sir, sir, sir— 
###BRABANTIO
You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this. 
###RODERIGO
Please wait, sir. 
###BRABANTIO
Why are you talking about robbery? This is Venice. My house isn’t in some remote countryside. 
###RODERIGO
Brabantio, with all due respect, I’m here out of courtesy and good will. I’ve come to tell you— 
###IAGO
My God, sir, you’re stubborn and suspicious. We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter. Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses. Your whole family will be ruined. 
###BRABANTIO
What kind of crude jerk are you? 
###IAGO
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now. 
###BRABANTIO
You’re a villain! 
###IAGO
You’re a senator! 
###BRABANTIO
You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo. I know who you are. 
###RODERIGO
I’ll answer for everything. I don’t know if you know or approve of this, but in the wee hours of the morning your daughter left your house, with no better escort than a hired gondolier, to go into the rough embrace of a lustful Moor. If all of this happened with your 
approval, then we’ve been very rude to bother you like this. But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us. I’d never play pranks on you. If you didn’t allow your daughter to do what she’s doing, then she’s rebelling against you. She’s throwing her life away on some stranger. Go ahead, see for yourself if she’s in her bedroom. If she is, you can sue me for lying to you. 
###BRABANTIO
Light the candles! Wake up my whole household! I dreamt about this. I’m starting to worry it’s true. Give me some light! 
## BRABANTIO exits.
###IAGO
(to RODERIGO) It’s time for me to say goodbye to you. It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed. The Venetian government might reprimand him for this, but it can’t safely get rid of him, since it needs him urgently for the imminent Cyprus wars. They couldn’t find another man with his abilities to lead their armed forces—not if their souls depended on it. I hate him, but I’ve got to show him signs of loyalty 
and affection, even if it’s just an act. If you want to find him, send the search party to the Sagittarius Inn. He and I will be there. 
## IAGO exits.
## BRABANTIO enters with servants and torches.
###BRABANTIO
It’s true. She’s gone. The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives. Do you think they’re married? 
###RODERIGO
Yes, I really think so. 
###BRABANTIO
Oh, heaven, how did she get out? My own flesh and blood rebels against me! Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent. Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray? Have you ever heard of anything like that, Roderigo? 
###RODERIGO
Yes, sir, I have. 
###BRABANTIO
Call my brother.—Now I wish you’d married her!—Some of you go one way, some the other way.—Do you know where we can find her and the Moor? 
###RODERIGO
I think I can find him. Get together a group of armed men and follow me. 
###BRABANTIO
Lead the way. I’ll stop at every house. I’m respected enough that most of them will do what I say.—Get your weapons! And get the officers who guard the city at night.—Let’s go, Roderigo. I’ll reward you for your troubles. 
##They exit
## OTHELLO and IAGO enter, followed by attendants with torches.
###IAGO
I’ve killed many men in battle, but I still believe it’s deeply wrong to murder someone. Sometimes I worry I’m not cruel enough for this job. Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs. 
###OTHELLO
It’s better that you didn’t kill him. 
###IAGO
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself. But please tell me, sir, is your marriage secure? Brabantio is an important man in this city, almost as powerful as the duke himself. He’ll try to annul your marriage, or else inflict whatever punishment the law and his power will allow him to. 
###OTHELLO
Let him do his worst. The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will. No one knows this yet—and I don’t like to brag, but I come from a royal family, and I’m as noble as the woman I’ve married. And let me tell you, Iago, if I didn’t love Desdemona as much as I do, I’d never agree to get married and lose my freedom at all. But look at those lights. Who’s coming? 
###IAGO
That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed. You’d better go inside. 
###OTHELLO
No, I must let them find me. My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me. Is it them? 
###IAGO
I don’t think so. 
## CASSIO enters with officers and men carrying torches.
###OTHELLO
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant? Hello, everyone! What’s going on? 
###CASSIO
The Duke sends his regards. He needs to see you right away. 
###OTHELLO
What do you think he wants? 
###CASSIO
Something about Cyprus. I think it’s important. The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already. They’re very anxious for you to get there. When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you. 
###OTHELLO
It’s good you found me. I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you. 
## OTHELLO exits.
###CASSIO
Ensign, what’s he doing in there? 
###IAGO
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship. If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever. 
###CASSIO
I don’t understand. 
###IAGO
He’s married. 
###CASSIO
To whom? 
###IAGO
To— 
## OTHELLO enters.
Are you ready? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, I’ll go with you now. 
###CASSIO
Here comes another group looking for you. 
## BRABANTIO and RODERIGO enter, followed by OFFICERS and men with torches.
###IAGO
It’s Brabantio. Look out, sir. He intends to do something bad to you. 
###OTHELLO
Hey! Stop right there! 
###RODERIGO
Sir, it’s the Moor. 
###BRABANTIO
Get him, he’s a thief! 
##Both sides draw their swords.
###IAGO
You, Roderigo! Come on, I’ll fight you. 
###OTHELLO
Put away your swords. They’ll get rusty in the dew. Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do. 
###BRABANTIO
You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter? You devil, you’ve put a spell on her! Anybody with eyes could tell you that a beautiful and happy young girl like her, who’s refused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city, wouldn’t run off with a black thing like you unless she’d been bewitched. You’re something to fear, not to love. It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her. That’s probably what happened, so I’m arresting you.—Arrest this man as a practitioner of black magic. Grab him. If he struggles, use force! 
###OTHELLO
Just a minute. I don’t need anyone to tell me when to fight. You’ve accused me of some serious crimes. Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges? 
###BRABANTIO
To prison, until you’re called into court. 
###OTHELLO
What if I do what you say? How would I satisfy the Duke then? His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business. 
###OFFICER
It’s true. The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too. 
###BRABANTIO
The Duke’s in a meeting? At this time of night? Bring him with us. The law’s on my side. The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own. If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers. 
##They all exit.
##The DUKE enters with SENATORS and OFFICERS.
###DUKE
These reports are inconsistent. You can’t trust them. 
###FIRST SENATOR
It’s true, they’re inconsistent. My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships. 
###DUKE
And mine say a hundred and forty. 
###SECOND SENATOR
And mine say two hundred. But often in these cases, reports are just estimates. The important thing is that they all say a Turkish fleet is approaching Cyprus. 
###DUKE
Yes, we get the idea. The inconsistency doesn’t make me think that the reports are all wrong. I have no doubt about what they’re basically saying, and it’s frightening. 
###SAILOR
(offstage) Hello! Hey, hello! 
###OFFICER
It’s a messenger from the warships. 
##A SAILOR enters.
###DUKE
Why are you here? 
###SAILOR
Signor Angelo told me to come here and tell you that the Turkish fleet is heading for Rhodes, not Cyprus. 
###DUKE
What do you think about this change? 
###FIRST SENATOR
They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true. It’s a trick to confuse us. Think about how important Cyprus is to the Turks, and remember that they could capture Cyprus more easily, since it isn’t as well protected as Rhodes is. If we keep these things in mind, we can’t possibly imagine that the Turks would be so incompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first, setting aside something easy and profitable to do something dangerous and pointless. 
###DUKE
No, I think we can be confident that the Turks aren’t really headed for Rhodes. 
###OFFICER
Here’s some more news coming in. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Sir, the Turks sailed to Rhodes, where they joined with another fleet. 
###FIRST SENATOR
That’s just what I thought. How many, can you guess? 
###MESSENGER
Thirty ships. Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus. Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him. 
###DUKE
Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus. Is Marcus Luccicos in town? 
###FIRST SENATOR
No, he’s in Florence. 
###DUKE
Write to him immediately. Hurry. 
###FIRST SENATOR
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor. 
## BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, CASSIO, IAGO, RODERIGO and the officers enter.
###DUKE
Brave Othello, I have to send you right away to fight the Turks, our great enemy.—(to BRABANTIO) Oh, I didn’t see you there. Welcome, sir. I could have used your wisdom and help tonight. 
###BRABANTIO
I could have used yours as well. Forgive me, your grace. I didn’t get out of bed and come here in the dead of night because I heard about the war or because I was worried about the city’s defense. I have a personal problem so painful and gut-wrenching that it overwhelms everything else. 
###DUKE
Why, what’s the matter? 
###BRABANTIO
It’s my daughter! Oh, my daughter! 
###FIRST SENATOR
Is she dead? 
###BRABANTIO
She’s dead to me. She’s been tricked and stolen from me, enchanted by black magic spells. She must’ve 
been tricked or drugged, because there’s no way she could have made this mistake on her own. 
###DUKE
Whoever tricked your daughter and stole her from you will pay for it. And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son. 
###BRABANTIO
I humbly thank you, sir. Here is the man, the Moor. It seems you had your own reasons for summoning him here. 
###ALL
We’re sorry to hear this. 
###DUKE
(to OTHELLO) What do you have to say for yourself? 
###BRABANTIO
Nothing, but this is true. 
###OTHELLO
Noble, honorable gentlemen whom I serve: it’s true that I’ve taken this man’s daughter from him and married her. But that’s my only offense. There’s nothing more. I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker. From the time I was seven years old until nine months ago I’ve been fighting in battles. I don’t know much about the world apart from fighting. So I won’t do myself much good by speaking in my own defense. But if you’ll let me, I’ll tell you the plain 
story of how we fell in love, and what drugs, charms, spells, and powerful magic—because that’s what I’m being accused of—I used to win his daughter. 
###BRABANTIO
She’s a good girl, quiet and obedient. She blushes at the slightest thing. And you want me to believe that despite her young age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a man she’d be afraid to look at? The very thought of it is ridiculous. You’d have to be stupid to think that someone so perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that. The devil must be behind this. Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her. 
###DUKE
Your saying this isn’t proof. There has to be clear evidence that he’s done this, not just these accusations. 
###FIRST SENATOR
Tell us, Othello. Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way? Or did you agree to this as equals? 
###OTHELLO
Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Inn and ask her to speak about me in front 
of her father. If she has anything bad to say about me, then you can sentence me to death. 
###DUKE
Bring Desdemona here. 
###OTHELLO
Iago, bring Desdemona here. You know where she is. 
## IAGO and attendants exit.
In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me. 
###DUKE
Tell us, Othello. 
###OTHELLO
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought. I told him everything, from my boyhood up until the time when I was talking to him. I told him about unfortunate disasters, hair-raising adventures on sea and on land, and near-catastrophes and dangerous adventures I’ve been through. I told him how I was captured and sold as a slave, how I bought my freedom, and how I wandered through caves and deserts. I was able to tell him about cannibals who eat each other, and men with heads growing below their shoulders. When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively. If she had to go do some household chore, I noticed that she’d always come back quickly to hear more of my stories. 
When I was relaxing, she’d pull me aside and ask to hear some part of a story she had missed. Her eyes would fill with tears at the bad things I went through in my younger years. When my stories were done, she’d sigh and tell me how strangely wonderful and sad my life had been. She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her. She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him. I took the hint and spoke to her. She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me. That’s the only witchcraft I ever used. Here comes my wife now. She’ll confirm everything. 
## DESDEMONA, IAGO, and attendants enter.
###DUKE
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over. Brabantio, I urge you to make the best of this. Try to accept what’s happened. 
###BRABANTIO
Please let her speak. If she admits she wanted this, then I won’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child. Who do you obey here? 
###DESDEMONA
Father, this isn’t easy for me. I’m torn. I owe you respect because you gave me life and education. You’re the one I have to obey. I’m your daughter. But this man here is my husband now, and I owe him as much as my mother owed you, just as she preferred you to her own father. So I have to give my obedience to the Moor, my husband. 
###BRABANTIO
I’m finished, then. Duke, please go ahead with your state business. I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor. I’m forced to give my blessing to this marriage. With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you. Desdemona, I’m glad you’re my only child, since if I had others I’d keep them all locked up. You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord. 
###DUKE
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it. When you lament something bad that’s already happened, you’re setting yourself up for more 
bad news. A robbery victim who can smile about his losses is superior to the thief who robbed him, but if he cries he’s just wasting time. 
###BRABANTIO
So if the Turks steal Cyprus from us, it won’t be bad as long as we keep smiling. It’s easy to accept platitudes like that if you haven’t lost anything. But I’ve lost something precious, and I have to put up with the platitude as well as suffering my loss. Talk is cheap. I’ve never heard of someone feeling better because of someone else’s words. Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs. 
###DUKE
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet. Othello, you understand better than anyone how the defenses for Cyprus work. Even though we have a very good officer in charge there already, everyone says you’re the better man for the job. So I’ll have to ask you to put a damper on your marriage celebrations and take part in this dangerous expedition. 
###OTHELLO
I’ve gotten used to the hardships of a military life. I rise to the occasion when faced with difficulties. I will take charge of this war against the Turks. But I humbly ask you to make appropriate arrangements for my wife, 
giving her a place to live and people to keep her company that suit her high rank. 
###DUKE
She can stay at her father’s house. 
###BRABANTIO
I won’t allow it. 
###OTHELLO
Neither will I. 
###DESDEMONA
And I wouldn’t stay there. I don’t want to upset my father by being in his house. Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say. 
###DUKE
What do you want to do, Desdemona? 
###DESDEMONA
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him. You can see how much I wanted to be with him by how violently I threw away my old life. I feel like I’m a part of him now, and that means I’m part of a soldier. I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind. I gave my whole life to him because of his honor and bravery. If I were left at home uselessly while he went off to war, then I’m separated from my husband in his natural element. I’d be miserable without him. Let me go with him. 
###OTHELLO
Please allow her to do this. I’m not asking to have her near me for sex—I’m too old for that, and my sexual 
urges are dead. I want this because she wants it—I love her for her mind. And I’d never want you to think that I’d neglect my serious official duties while she was there with me. If I ever let love blind me so that I choose to lounge around in bed with my loved one instead of going off to war, then you can let a housewife use my helmet as a frying pan. My reputation would be disgraced if I ever acted like that. 
###DUKE
You can decide that privately. I don’t care whether she stays or goes. What’s important is the urgency of this mission. You’ve got to act fast. 
###FIRST SENATOR
You’ll have to leave tonight. 
###OTHELLO
With all my heart, I’ll go right away. 
###DUKE
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning. Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you. 
###OTHELLO
My lord, my ensign is an honest and trustworthy man. He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need. 
###DUKE
All right, then. Good night, everyone.—(to BRABANTIO) Sir, if goodness is beautiful, your son-in-law is beautiful, not black. 
###FIRST SENATOR
Goodbye, black Moor. Treat Desdemona well. 
###BRABANTIO
Keep an eye on her, Moor. She lied to me, and she may lie to you. 
##The DUKE, BRABANTIO, CASSIO, SENATORS, and officers exit.
###OTHELLO
I’d bet my life she’d never lie to me. Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you. Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can. Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do. We’re on a tight schedule. 
## OTHELLO and DESDEMONA exit.
###RODERIGO
Iago. 
###IAGO
What do you have to say, noble friend? 
###RODERIGO
What do you think I should do? 
###IAGO
Go to bed, and sleep. 
###RODERIGO
I’m going to go drown myself. 
###IAGO
If you do that, I’ll never respect you again. Why, you silly man! 
###RODERIGO
It’s silly to live when life is torture. The only cure is death. 
###IAGO
Oh, how stupid! I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him. I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have. 
###RODERIGO
What should I do? I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it. 
###IAGO
Can’t help it? Nonsense! What we are is up to us. Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener. Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive. If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over. We’d end up in ridiculous situations. Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts. In my opinion, what you call love is just an offshoot of lust. 
###RODERIGO
I don’t believe it. 
###IAGO
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower. Come on, be a man. Drown yourself? Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself! I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you. 
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now. Here’s what you’ll do. Sell all your assets and your land, and turn it into cash. Desdemona can’t continue loving the Moor any more than he can continue loving her. She fell in love with him very suddenly, and they’ll break up just as suddenly. Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash. What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter. She’ll dump Othello for a younger man. When she’s had enough of the Moor’s body, she’ll realize her mistake. She’ll need to have a new lover. She’ll have to have it. So have your money ready. If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself. Raise all the money you can. I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl. You’ll get to sleep with her—just put together some money. And to hell with drowning yourself! That’s completely beside the point. If you’re ready to die, you can risk death by committing crimes in an attempt to get the woman you want. Don’t just give up on her and drown yourself. 
###RODERIGO
Can I count on you if I wait to see what happens? 
###IAGO
You can trust me. Go now and get cash. I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor. I’m devoted to my cause of hating him, just as devoted as you are to yours. So let’s join forces and get revenge. If you seduce Desdemona and make a fool out of him, it’ll be fun for both of us. Many things may happen. Go get money. We’ll speak again tomorrow. Goodbye. 
###RODERIGO
Where will we meet in the morning? 
###IAGO
At my house. 
###RODERIGO
I’ll be there early. 
###IAGO
Go home. Goodbye. Oh, and one more thing— 
###RODERIGO
What is it? 
###IAGO
No more talk about killing yourself, okay? 
###RODERIGO
I’ve changed my mind about that. 
###IAGO
Go then, goodbye. Put a lot of cash together. 
###RODERIGO
I’m going to sell all my land. 
## RODERIGO exits.
###IAGO
That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools. I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him. I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife. I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me. He thinks highly of me. That’ll help. Cassio’s a handsome man. Let’s see, how can I 
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time? How? How? Let’s see. After a while I’ll start telling Othello that Cassio is too intimate with Desdemona. Cassio is a smooth talker and a good-looking guy, the sort of man that people would expect to be a seducer. The Moor is open and straightforward. He thinks any man who seems honest is honest. People like that are easy to manipulate. So it’s all decided. I’ve worked it out. With a little help from the devil, I’ll bring this monstrous plan to success. 
##He exits.
## MONTANO and two GENTLEMEN enter.
###MONTANO
What can you see out on the ocean? 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN
Nothing. The water’s so rough that I can’t see any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean. 
###MONTANO
It was windy on shore too. A big blast of wind shook our fortifications. How could a ship made out of wood hold together in those mountainous waves? What do you think will be the result of this storm? 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN
The Turkish navy will be broken up. The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky. I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed. 
###MONTANO
If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned. No ship could survive this storm. 
##A THIRD GENTLEMAN enters.
###THIRD GENTLEMAN
I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over! This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined. One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked. 
###MONTANO
What? Is this true? 
###THIRD GENTLEMAN
The ship’s sailing into harbor now; it’s from Verona. Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore. The Moor himself is still at sea. He’s been commissioned to come here to Cyprus. 
###MONTANO
I’m happy about that. He’ll be a good governor. 
###THIRD GENTLEMAN
Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, but he’s worried about the Othello’s safety. The two of them were separated during the storm. 
###MONTANO
I hope to God Othello’s all right. I served under him, and I know what an excellent commander he is. Let’s go to the shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look out for Othello’s ship. We’ll stare out at the sea until the sea and the sky blur together. 
###THIRD GENTLEMAN
Let’s do that. Every minute we expect more ships to arrive. 
## CASSIO enters.
###CASSIO
Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello. I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea. 
###MONTANO
Is his ship sturdy? 
###CASSIO
Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced. For that reason I still have some hope for him, even though I don’t have my hopes up too high. 
###A VOICE
(offstage) A sail! A sail! A sail! 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###CASSIO
What’s all that shouting about? 
###MESSENGER
Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting “A sail!” 
###CASSIO
I hope it’s Othello. 
##A shot is heard.
###SECOND GENTLEMAN
They’ve fired a greeting shot, so at least it’s a friendly ship. 
###CASSIO
Please go find out for certain who has arrived. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN
I’ll do that. 
## SECOND GENTLEMAN exits.
###MONTANO
Good lieutenant, is your general married? 
###CASSIO
Yes, and he’s very lucky to have married the woman he did. His wife defies description. She’s God’s masterpiece, and she’d exhaust whoever tried to do her justice while praising her. 
##The SECOND GENTLEMAN enters.
Who’s arrived in the harbor? 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN
A man named Iago, the general’s ensign. 
###CASSIO
He made good time. You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, and the sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman. They let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound. 
###MONTANO
Who’s that? 
###CASSIO
She’s the one I was talking about, the general’s wife. The brave Iago was put in charge of bringing her here, and he’s arrived a week sooner than we expected. Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive here safely, so he and Desdemona can be in each other’s arms, and Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus. 
## DESDEMONA, IAGO, RODERIGO and EMILIA enter.
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore. We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus! Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you. 
###DESDEMONA
Thank you, brave Cassio. Is there any news about my husband? 
###CASSIO
He hasn’t arrived yet. As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, but I’m worried. How did you two get separated? 
###CASSIO
The storm separated us. 
###A VOICE
(offstage) A sail! A sail! 
###CASSIO
Listen, they’ve spotted another ship! 
##A gunshot is heard.
###SECOND GENTLEMAN
They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly ship. 
###CASSIO
Go find out the news. 
## SECOND GENTLEMAN exits.
Ensign Iago, welcome.—And welcome to you, too, madam. (he kisses EMILIA) Don’t be upset that I kissed your wife hello, Iago. It’s a courtesy where I come from. 
###IAGO
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now. 
###DESDEMONA
On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman. 
###IAGO
No, she talks too much. She’s always talking when I want to sleep. I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet. But she’s scolding me silently. 
###EMILIA
You have no reason to say that. 
###IAGO
Come on, come on. You women are all the same. You’re as pretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your own houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells. In your own kitchens you act like wildcats. You make yourselves sound like saints when you’re complaining about something, but you act like devils when someone offends you. You don’t take your jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless hussies in bed. 
###DESDEMONA
Shame on you, you slanderer! 
###IAGO
No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain. You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed. 
###EMILIA
You clearly have nothing good to say about me. 
###IAGO
No, I don’t. 
###DESDEMONA
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say? 
###IAGO
Don’t make me do it, my lady. I’m critical by nature. 
###DESDEMONA
Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to the harbor? 
###IAGO
Yes, madam. 
###DESDEMONA
I’m not as happy as I seem. I’m just trying not to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety. Come on, what would you say about me? 
###IAGO
I’m trying to think of something, but I’m not good at inventing clever things. It takes time. Ah, I’ve got it. If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her good looks to get what she wants. 
###DESDEMONA
Very clever! But what if the woman is smart but ugly? 
###IAGO
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her. 
###DESDEMONA
This is getting worse and worse! 
###EMILIA
What if she’s pretty but stupid? 
###IAGO
No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her more attractive to men. 
###DESDEMONA
These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars. What horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s both ugly and stupid? 
###IAGO
No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do. 
###DESDEMONA
You don’t know a thing! You give your best praise to the worst women. But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her? 
###IAGO
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— 
###DESDEMONA
Would do what? 
###IAGO
Would raise babies and clip coupons. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, that’s pathetic! Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband. What do you think about him, Cassio? Isn’t he a horrible man? 
###CASSIO
He speaks bluntly, madam. He’s more of a soldier than a wise man. 
## CASSIO takes DESDEMONA'S hand.
###IAGO
(to himself) He’s taking her hand. That’s right, go ahead and whisper together. This is all I need to get Cassio. Yes, keep smiling at her, Cassio. Your fine manners around women will be your downfall. Oh, I’m sure you’re saying something very clever. 
If you lose your job because of little flirtations like this, you’ll wish you hadn’t been so courteous with her. Oh, how nice, you’re kissing your own hand, one finger at a time? I wish those fingers were enema tubes!— 
##A trumpet plays offstage.
That’s the Moor! I recognize his trumpet. 
###CASSIO
Yes, it is. 
###DESDEMONA
Let’s go greet him when he lands. 
###CASSIO
Look, here he comes. 
## OTHELLO enters with attendants.
###OTHELLO
My beautiful warrior! 
###DESDEMONA
My darling Othello! 
###OTHELLO
I’m amazed you got here before me. But I’m overjoyed! My love, if the calm after the storm could always be this wonderful, I’d want the wind to blow until it waked the dead, and whipped up waves as tall as mountains! If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life. 
###DESDEMONA
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older. 
###OTHELLO
Amen to that! I can’t talk about my happiness anymore. It’s too much. I hope these kisses I’m about to give you are the closest we ever come to fighting.(they kiss) 
###IAGO
(to himself) Oh, you’re happy now, but I’ll ruin your happiness, for all my supposed honesty. 
###OTHELLO
Let’s go up to the castle. Good news, friends. The war’s over and the Turks are drowned. How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus. They’ve been very good to me here. Oh, my dear, I’m blabbing on and on because I’m so happy.—Iago, would you be good enough to go get my trunks from the ships? And bring the ship’s captain to the castle. He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona. I’ll say it again: I’m so happy to see you here in Cyprus! 
## OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and attendants exit.
###IAGO
Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here. They say love makes cowards brave. So if you’re brave, listen to me. Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight. But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him. 
###RODERIGO
With Cassio? That’s impossible. 
###IAGO
Be quiet and listen to me. Remember how she fell madly in love with the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories? Did you expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering? You’re too smart to think that. No, she needs someone nice-looking. Othello’s ugly, what pleasure could she find in him? Lovemaking gets boring after a while. To keep things hot, she’ll need to see someone with a handsome face, someone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her. Othello isn’t any of those things. Since he doesn’t have these advantages to make him attractive to her, she’ll get sick of him until he makes her want to puke. She’ll start looking around for a second choice. Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio? He’s a smooth talker, and uses sophistication and fine manners to hide his lust. Nobody’s as crafty as he is. Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for. He’s a bad boy, and Desdemona’s got her eye on him already. 
###RODERIGO
I can’t believe that. She’s not that kind of woman. She’s very moral. 
###IAGO
Like hell she is! She’s made of the same flesh and blood as everyone else. If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place. Good lord! Did you notice how she and Cassio were fondling each other’s hands? Did you see that? 
###RODERIGO
Yes, I did. But that wasn’t romantic, it was just polite manners. 
###IAGO
They were lusting after each other. You could tell by how they were acting that they’re going to be lovers. They were so close that their breath was mingling. When two people get that intimate, sex will soon follow. Disgusting! But listen to me; let me guide you. I brought you here from Venice. Be on guard duty tonight. I’ll put you in charge. Cassio doesn’t know you. I’ll be nearby. Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want. 
###RODERIGO
All right. 
###IAGO
He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff. Try to get him to do that. That’ll allow me to stir up public sentiment against him here in Cyprus. I’ll get them so riled up that they’ll only calm down when Cassio’s fired. To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way. If you don’t do that, things are hopeless for you. 
###RODERIGO
I’ll do it, if you help me out. 
###IAGO
I promise I will. Meet me in a little while at the citadel. I need to get Othello’s things from the ship. Goodbye. 
###RODERIGO
Goodbye. 
## RODERIGO exits.
###IAGO
I think Cassio really does love her, and it’s perfectly likely that she loves him too. I can’t stand the Moor, but I have to admit that he’s a reliable, loving, and good-natured man. He’d probably be a good husband to Desdemona. I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feed my revenge. I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife. That thought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside. I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife. If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight. If that piece of Venetian trash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan, I’ll have power over Cassio. I’ll say bad things about him to the Moor. I have a feeling Cassio seduced my wife as well. I’ll make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time. I’ve got a good plan, though I haven’t worked out the details yet. You can never see the end of an evil plan until the moment comes. 
## IAGO exits.
##Othello’s HERALD enters with a proclamation.
###HERALD
Our noble and courageous general Othello having been informed that the Turkish fleet has been completely destroyed, invites every man to celebrate our victory. Some of you dance, some of you make bonfires, and every man celebrate in whatever way he likes to. For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage. That’s the end of the announcement. There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven. God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! 
##The HERALD exits.
## OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO and attendants enter.
###OTHELLO
Good Michael, keep a careful eye on the guards tonight. Let’s exercise restraint and not let the party get too wild. 
###CASSIO
Iago has orders what to do. But I’ll see to it personally anyway. 
###OTHELLO
Iago’s a good man. Goodnight, Michael. Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love. Now that the wedding’s over, we can have the pleasure of consummating our marriage. Good night, everyone. 
## OTHELLO and DESDEMONA exit with their attendants.
## IAGO enters.
###CASSIO
Hello, Iago. It’s time for us to stand guard. 
###IAGO
Not yet, lieutenant. It’s not even ten o'clock. The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him. He hasn’t spent the night with her yet, and she’s beautiful enough to be Jove’s lover. 
###CASSIO
She’s an exquisitely beautiful lady. 
###IAGO
And I bet she’s good in bed too. 
###CASSIO
Yes, she’s young and tender. 
###IAGO
And such pretty eyes! Like an invitation. 
###CASSIO
Yes, she’s pretty. But she’s modest and ladylike too. 
###IAGO
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion? 
###CASSIO
She’s a perfect woman, it’s true. 
###IAGO
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed! Come with us, lieutenant. I’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen want to drink a toast to the black Othello. 
###CASSIO
Not tonight, Iago. I’m not much of a drinker. I wish there was less social pressure to drink. 
###IAGO
Oh, but these are our friends. Just one glass. I’ll do most of the drinking for you. 
###CASSIO
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am. I’m not a heavy drinker. I wouldn’t dare drink much more than that. 
###IAGO
What are you talking about, man? Tonight is for celebrating! The gentlemen are waiting. 
###CASSIO
Where are they? 
###IAGO
By the door. Please invite them in. 
###CASSIO
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it. 
## CASSIO exits.
###IAGO
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog. That fool Roderigo, all twisted up inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by the gallon, and he’s on guard duty.I’ve gotten the rest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cyprus who are quick to take offense. Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island. Here they come. If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success. 
## CASSIO, MONTANO, and GENTLEMEN enter, followed by servants with wine.
###CASSIO
My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink. 
###MONTANO
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint. 
###IAGO
Bring in more wine! (he sings)  And clink your glasses together,  And clink your glasses together.  A soldier’s a man,  And a man’s life is short,  So let the soldier drink.  Have some more wine, boys! 
###CASSIO
My God, what a great song! 
###IAGO
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking. The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English. 
###CASSIO
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers? 
###IAGO
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans. And the Dutch are vomiting while the English are asking for refills. 
###CASSIO
Let’s drink to our general! 
###MONTANO
Hear, hear! I’ll drink as much as you do! 
###IAGO
Oh, sweet England! (he sings)  King Stephen was a good king, and his pants were very cheap,  But he thought his tailor overcharged him, so he called him a peasant.  And that was a man of noble rank, much higher than you are.  So be happy with your worn-out cloak,  Since pride is ruining the nation.  More wine! 
###CASSIO
God, that song’s even better than the other one. 
###IAGO
Do you want to hear it again? 
###CASSIO
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff. Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell. 
###IAGO
That’s true, lieutenant. 
###CASSIO
Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven. 
###IAGO
Me too, lieutenant. 
###CASSIO
Okay, but please not before me. The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign. But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business. By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk. This is my ensign. This is my right hand, and this is my left hand. I’m not drunk. I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine. 
###ALL
Yes, you’re speaking very well. 
###CASSIO
Yes, very well. So don’t think that I’m drunk. 
## CASSIO exits.
###MONTANO
Let’s go to the platform where we’ll stand guard. Come on. 
## GENTLEMEN exit.
###IAGO
You see that man who just left? He’s a good soldier, good enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man. But he has a serious weakness. It’s too bad. I’m worried that Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for Cyprus eventually. 
###MONTANO
But is he often like this? 
###IAGO
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep. He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep. 
###MONTANO
The general should be informed about this. Maybe he’s never noticed, or he only wants to see Cassio’s good side. Don’t you think so? 
## RODERIGO enters.
###IAGO
(speaking so that only RODERIGO can hear) Hello, Roderigo. Please, follow the lieutenant. Hurry! Go! 
## RODERIGO exits.
###MONTANO
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command. We should definitely say something to the Moor. 
###IAGO
I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole island for doing so. I respect Cassio and I’d like to help cure his alcoholism— 
##A voice offstage calls “Help! Help!”
###IAGO
What’s that noise? 
## CASSIO enters, chasing RODERIGO.
###CASSIO
Damn you, you villain, you rascal! 
###MONTANO
What’s the matter, lieutenant? 
###CASSIO
To think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners! I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave! 
###RODERIGO
You’ll beat me? 
###CASSIO
Are you talking, you villain?(he hits RODERIGO) 
###MONTANO
No, don’t hit him, lieutenant! Please, sir, restrain yourself. (he restrains CASSIO) 
###CASSIO
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head. 
###MONTANO
Come on, you’re drunk. 
###CASSIO
Drunk? 
## MONTANO and CASSIO fight.
###IAGO
(speaking so that only RODERIGO can hear) Go tell everyone there’s a riot.— 
## RODERIGO exits.
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming! 
##Someone rings a bell.
Who’s sounding that alarm? The whole town will riot! God, lieutenant, please stop! You’ll be ashamed of this forever! 
## OTHELLO enters with attendants.
###OTHELLO
What is the matter here? 
###MONTANO
My God, I’m bleeding! I’ve been mortally wounded. I’ll kill him! 
###OTHELLO
Stop right now! 
###IAGO
Stop! Lieutenant—sir, Montano—gentlemen! Have you forgotten your duty and your sense of decorum? Stop! The general is talking to you! Stop, for God’s sake! 
###OTHELLO
How did this all start? Have we all become as savage as the Turks, treating each other as badly as they would have treated us? For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl! The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies. Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders. What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset. Speak up and tell me who started this. Answer me. 
###IAGO
I don’t know. We were all having fun until just a minute ago; we were as happy as a bride and groom taking off their clothes. But then the mood suddenly changed. It was as if something had driven the men insane and made them point their swords at one another. I don’t 
know what could have started this. I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this! 
###OTHELLO
How did you manage to lose your self-control like this, Michael? 
###CASSIO
Please, excuse me, sir. I can’t speak. 
###OTHELLO
Montano, you’re supposed to be calm and collected. You’re famous for it. Wise people respect you. What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler? Tell me. 
###MONTANO
Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt. Your officer Iago can tell you what happened. I should save my breath, since it hurts to talk. I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me. 
###OTHELLO
All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool. By God, if you don’t tell me what happened you’ll all suffer. Tell me how this fight began, who started it. Whoever is guilty, even if he were my twin brother, I swear I’m through with him. We’re in a town that’s just 
avoided a war, everyone’s still on edge, and you’re getting into private fights while you’re supposed to be on guard duty? That’s unbelievably bad. Iago, who started it? 
###MONTANO
I know you’re close to Cassio, but if you diverge from the truth in any way, you’re not a true soldier. 
###IAGO
You’re hitting close to home there. I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio. But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth. This is what happened, General. Montano and I were talking when a man came running, crying for help. Cassio was chasing him with his sword out, trying to kill the guy. This gentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword. I followed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaring the public. But he was fast and outran me. When I got back, I heard the swords clinking and Cassio swearing. I’d never heard him swear before. They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart. I can’t tell you anything else. 
But nobody’s perfect, and even the best man sometimes loses control and strikes out in rage. Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass. 
###OTHELLO
Iago, I know you’re fond of Cassio and are downplaying this for his benefit. Cassio, I love you, but you’re never again going to be one of my officers.— 
## DESDEMONA enters with attendants.
Look, you’ve woken my wife! I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from. 
###DESDEMONA
What’s the matter, dear? 
###OTHELLO
Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart. Go back to bed.— (to MONTANO) I’ll see to it personally that your wounds are treated. Lead him off. 
## MONTANO is carried off.
Iago, go and calm down the townspeople.—Come with me, Desdemona. Unfortunately, it’s part of the soldier’s life to be woken up by trouble. 
##Everyone except CASSIO and IAGO exits.
###IAGO
Are you hurt, lieutenant? 
###CASSIO
Yes, but no doctor can help me. 
###IAGO
Oh I hope that’s not true! 
###CASSIO
My reputation, my reputation! I’ve lost my reputation, the longest-living and truest part of myself! Everything else in me is just animal-like. Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation! 
###IAGO
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically. Your physical health matters more than your reputation. A reputation is a useless and fake quality that others impose on us. You haven’t lost it unless you think you have. There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again. You’ve been discharged because he’s angry, and because he’s obliged to do so for policy reasons, not because he dislikes you. He’s got to beat up the weak to frighten the strong. Go to him, petition him. He’ll change his mind. 
###CASSIO
I’d rather ask him to hate me than ask such a good commander to accept such a worthless, drunk, stupid officer as myself. Drunk? Babbling senselessly? Squabbling? Swaggering? Swearing? Ranting and raving to my own shadow! Oh, wine is the devil! 
###IAGO
Who were you chasing with your sword? What did he do to you? 
###CASSIO
I don’t know. 
###IAGO
Is that possible? 
###CASSIO
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly. I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting. Oh God, why do men drink and lose their minds? Why do we party until we’re like animals? 
###IAGO
You seem all right now. How did you get better? 
###CASSIO
My drunkenness went away when anger took over. One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself. 
###IAGO
Come on, you’re being too hard on yourself. I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank. But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good. 
###CASSIO
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk. Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that. I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast! Oh, how strange! Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient! 
###IAGO
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it. Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore. Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend. 
###CASSIO
I know that, sir. Imagine, me, a drunk! 
###IAGO
Any man can get drunk sometime. I’ll tell you what to do. Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now. He’s completely devoted to her. Go open your heart to her. Ask her to help you get back your position. She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do. Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you. I’d bet my lucky stars your problem will be forgotten, and your relationship will be stronger than ever. 
###CASSIO
That’s good advice. 
###IAGO
I’m helping you because I like and respect you. 
###CASSIO
I believe it completely. Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case. My situation is desperate. 
###IAGO
You’re doing the right thing. Good night, lieutenant. I’ve got to go to the guard tower. 
###CASSIO
Good night, honest Iago. 
## CASSIO exits.
###IAGO
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good? That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again. It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side. She’s full of good intentions. And the Moor loves her so much he would renounce his Christianity to keep her happy. He’s so enslaved by love that she can make him do whatever she wants. How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good? That’s the kind of argument you’d expect from Satan! When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now. And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and while she’s pleading his case to the Moor, I’ll poison the Moor’s ear against her, hinting that she’s taking Cassio’s side because of her lust for him. The more she 
tries to help Cassio, the more she’ll shake Othello’s confidence in her. And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all. 
## RODERIGO enters.
Hello, Roderigo! 
###RODERIGO
I’m totally worn out. My chase is too much for me. I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up. The upshot is that I’ve got a little more experience. So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice. 
###IAGO
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient! If you get hurt, does your wound heal immediately? No, it heals gradually. We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time. Aren’t things going well? Cassio’s beaten you up, but with that tiny sacrifice on your part, you got Cassio discharged! If we’re patient, we’ll be rewarded with the fruits of our labors. My God, it’s morning. All this excitement has made the time fly by. Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep. Go on, I’m telling you. You’ll understand better later. Go. 
## RODERIGO exits.
Now two things still need to be done. My wife has to help make Desdemona take Cassio’s side. I’ll put her on that. And I need to take the Moor aside right at the moment when Cassio’s talking to Desdemona, so he’ll see them together. Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it. Let’s not ruin a brilliant plan by being slow to act. 
## IAGO exits.
## CASSIO enters with MUSICIANS.
###CASSIO
Musicians, start playing here. I’ll pay you for your trouble. Play something short that will put the general in a good mood. 
##The MUSICIANS play. The CLOWN enters.
###CLOWN
Your instruments all have a nasal twang. Have they been to Naples? 
###MUSICIAN
Excuse me? 
###CLOWN
Are these wind instruments? 
###MUSICIAN
Yes, they are. 
###CLOWN
Oh, there’s the problem. 
###MUSICIAN
What’s the problem? 
###CLOWN
Anyone full of hot air is a problem. But here’s some money. The general likes your music a lot, but he asks you to stop playing now. 
###MUSICIAN
Well, we’ll stop, then. 
###CLOWN
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that. But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now. 
###MUSICIAN
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard. 
###CLOWN
Then pack up your instruments and go away. Go! 
##The MUSICIANS exit.
###CASSIO
Do you hear, my friend? 
###CLOWN
No, I don’t hear your friend. I hear you. 
###CASSIO
Please don’t play games. (CASSIO gives CLOWN money). There’s a bit of gold for you. When the woman taking care of the general’s wife wakes up, could you please tell her that Cassio asks to speak with her? 
###CLOWN
She’s awake, sir. If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message. 
##The CLOWN exits.
## IAGO enters.
Good to see you, Iago. 
###IAGO
You didn’t go to sleep, then? 
###CASSIO
No. When I left you it was already morning. I’ve been bold, Iago. I’ve asked to talk to your wife. I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona. 
###IAGO
I’ll send her out to you now. I’ll think of a plan to get the Moor out of the way, so you can speak more openly. 
###CASSIO
I humbly thank you. 
## IAGO exits.
Even for a Florentine, I never knew someone so kind and honest. 
## EMILIA enters.
###EMILIA
Good morning, lieutenant. I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right. The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly. The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you. But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back. 
###CASSIO
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right. 
###EMILIA
Please come in. I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely. 
###CASSIO
Thank you very much. 
##They exit.
## OTHELLO, IAGO and GENTLEMEN enter.
###OTHELLO
Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice. Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls. Look for me there when you come back. 
###IAGO
I will, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
Shall we go see this fortification, men? 
###GENTLEMEN
We’re at your service, my lord. 
##They all exit.
## DESDEMONA, CASSIO and EMILIA enter.
###DESDEMONA
I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio. 
###EMILIA
Please do, madam. My husband’s so upset about Cassio’s problem you’d think it was his own. 
###DESDEMONA
Your husband’s such a good man. Don’t worry, Cassio. I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before. 
###CASSIO
My dear beautiful lady, whatever happens to Michael Cassio, he’ll always be your humble servant. 
###DESDEMONA
I know that. Thank you. You’re my husband’s friend and you’ve known him a long time. I assure you the only reason he’s keeping away from you now is political. 
###CASSIO
Yes, my lady. But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job. 
###DESDEMONA
That’ll never happen. Emilia here will be my witness: I promise you that you’ll get your position back again. And if I promise to help someone, I do everything I can. My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out 
of patience. He will think that his bed has become a conference table for discussing your problem—he won’t be able to get away from it. I’ll bring up your name at every moment. So cheer up. I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you. 
## OTHELLO and IAGO enter.
###EMILIA
Madam, here comes your husband. 
###CASSIO
Madam, I’d better leave now. 
###DESDEMONA
Why not stay and hear me talk to him? 
###CASSIO
No, madam. I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case. 
###DESDEMONA
Well, do whatever you think best. 
## CASSIO exits.
###IAGO
Hey! I don’t like that. 
###OTHELLO
What did you say? 
###IAGO
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what. 
###OTHELLO
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife? 
###IAGO
Cassio, my lord? No, I don’t think so. He wouldn’t sneak away looking so guilty when he saw you coming. 
###OTHELLO
I really think it was him. 
###DESDEMONA
What’s this, my lord? I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger. 
###OTHELLO
Who do you mean? 
###DESDEMONA
Your lieutenant, Cassio. Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him. In my judgment, this man truly loves you, and his mistake was innocent rather than wicked. Please call him and tell him to come back here. 
###OTHELLO
Was that him just now? 
###DESDEMONA
Yes. He feels so bad and humble that I feel bad along with him. My love, call him back in here. 
###OTHELLO
Not now, my sweet Desdemona. Some other time. 
###DESDEMONA
But will it be soon? 
###OTHELLO
Very soon, because you want it. 
###DESDEMONA
Will it be tonight at supper? 
###OTHELLO
No, not tonight. 
###DESDEMONA
Then tomorrow at dinner? 
###OTHELLO
I won’t be eating dinner at home. I’ll be meeting the captains at the citadel. 
###DESDEMONA
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning. Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days. He’s very sorry. His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers. So when should he come? Tell me, Othello. I can’t imagine you asking me for something and me telling you no or standing there muttering. Michael Cassio came with you when you were trying to win my love. Sometimes I’d criticize you to him, and he’d defend you. And now I have to make this big fuss about bringing him back? I swear, I could do so much— 
###OTHELLO
Please, no more. He can come whenever he wants. I won’t refuse you anything. 
###DESDEMONA
Don’t act like you’re doing me a favor! This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you. If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible. 
###OTHELLO
I won’t deny you anything! But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while. 
###DESDEMONA
Would I ever deny you anything? No. Goodbye, my husband. 
###OTHELLO
Goodbye, my Desdemona. I’ll come see you right away. 
###DESDEMONA
Come here, Emilia.—Do whatever you feel like doing, my husband, and I’ll obey you. 
## DESDEMONA and EMILIA exit.
###OTHELLO
What a wonderful girl! God help me, I love you! And when I stop loving you, the universe will fall back into the chaos that was there when time began. 
###IAGO
My noble lord— 
###OTHELLO
What is it, Iago? 
###IAGO
When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, he knew about it the whole time. Why do you ask? 
###IAGO
I was just curious. No reason. 
###OTHELLO
Why are you curious, Iago? 
###IAGO
I didn’t realize he knew her. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, yes. He carried messages back and forth between us very often. 
###IAGO
Oh, really? 
###OTHELLO
Oh, really? Yes, really. Do you see something wrong with that? Isn’t he an honest man? 
###IAGO
Honest, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
Honest, yes, honest. 
###IAGO
As far as I know, sir. 
###OTHELLO
What are you thinking? 
###IAGO
Thinking, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
“Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud. You’re thinking something. Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife. What didn’t you like? And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible. If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking. 
###IAGO
My lord, you know I’m your friend. 
###OTHELLO
I think you are. And I know you’re full of love and honesty, and you think carefully before you speak. That’s why these pauses of yours frighten me. If some fool were withholding things from me, I wouldn’t think twice about it. If some lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick. But when an honest man acts like that, you know he’s wrestling with bad thoughts and can’t help it. 
###IAGO
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest. 
###OTHELLO
I think so too. 
###IAGO
People should be what they appear to be. If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are! 
###OTHELLO
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be. 
###IAGO
In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man. 
###OTHELLO
No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on. Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions. 
###IAGO
Please don’t make me do that, sir. I have to obey all your orders, but surely I’m not obligated to reveal my deepest thoughts—even slaves aren’t expected to do that. You want me to say what I’m thinking? What if my thoughts are disgusting and wrong? Even good people think horrible things sometimes. Who is so pure that they never think a bad thought? 
###OTHELLO
You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even think your friend has been wronged and you don’t tell him about it. 
###IAGO
Please don’t ask me to tell you. I might be completely wrong. I have a bad tendency to be suspicious of people and to look too closely into what they’re doing. Often I imagine crimes that aren’t really there. You would be wise to ignore my weak guesses and imaginary suspicions, and don’t worry yourself about the meaningless things I’ve noticed. For me to tell you my thoughts would only destroy your peace of mind, and 
it wouldn’t be wise, honest, or responsible for me to tell them. 
###OTHELLO
What are you talking about? 
###IAGO
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike. If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash. It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more. But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer. 
###OTHELLO
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking. 
###IAGO
You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you. And as long my heart’s inside my body, you never will. 
###OTHELLO
What? 
###IAGO
Beware of jealousy, my lord! It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours. The man who knows his wife is cheating on him is happy, because at least he isn’t friends with the man she’s sleeping with. But think of the unhappiness of a man who worships his wife, yet doubts her faithfulness. He suspects her, but still loves her. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, what misery! 
###IAGO
The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough. But infinite riches are nothing to someone who’s always afraid he’ll be poor. God, help us not be jealous! 
###OTHELLO
Why are you telling me this? Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour? No. If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt. I might as well be a goat if I ever let myself become obsessed with the kind of suspicions you’re implying. If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous. When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better. And I’m not going to start feeling inferior. She had her eyes wide open when she chose me. No, Iago, I’ll have to see some real evidence before I start suspecting her of anything bad, and when I suspect her, I’ll look for proof, and if there’s proof, that’s when I’ll let go of my love and my jealousy. 
###IAGO
I’m glad to hear you say that. Now I can show you my devotion and my duty with more honesty. So please listen to me. I’m not talking about proof yet. Watch your wife. Watch how she is with Cassio. Just watch—don’t be either completely suspicious or completely trustful. I wouldn’t want to see you taken advantage of because you’re such an open and trusting guy. Watch out! I know the people of Venice well. They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands. They don’t avoid doing things that are wrong, they just try not to get caught. 
###OTHELLO
Do you really think so? 
###IAGO
She lied to her father to marry you. And when she pretended to be afraid of you, she loved you the most. 
###OTHELLO
That’s right, she did. 
###IAGO
Well, there you go. She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft! But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out. I beg your pardon for loving you too much. 
###OTHELLO
I’m indebted to you forever. 
###IAGO
You seem a little depressed about this. 
###OTHELLO
Not at all, not at all. 
###IAGO
Really, I’m afraid you are. I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you. But I see you’re troubled. Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken. 
###OTHELLO
I won’t. 
###IAGO
If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have. Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset. 
###OTHELLO
No, not too upset. I’m sure Desdemona would never cheat on me. 
###IAGO
I hope she never does! And I hope you keep on thinking she wouldn’t. 
###OTHELLO
But still, it’s true that good things can go bad, away from their true natures— 
###IAGO
That’s the point I’m trying to make. If I can be frank with you, she veered away from her own nature in turning down all those young men from her own country, with her skin color, with her status—everything her nature would have drawn her to—Ugh! You can almost smell the dark and ugly desires inside her, the unnatural thoughts—But—I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to refer to her specifically just now. I only worry that she might snap back to her natural taste in men one day, and compare you unfavorably to other Italians. 
###OTHELLO
Goodbye, goodbye. If you see anything else, let me know. Tell your wife to watch her. Leave me alone now, Iago. 
###IAGO
My lord, I’ll say goodbye now. (beginning to exit) 
###OTHELLO
(to himself) Why did I ever get married? I’m sure this good and honest man sees and knows more, much more, than he’s telling me. 
###IAGO
(returning) My lord, please don’t think about this any more. Time will tell. It’s right for Cassio to have his lieutenancy back—he’s very talented. But keep him away for a while, and you’ll see how he goes about getting it back. Notice whether your wife insists on your 
giving it back to him. That will tell you a lot. But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please. 
###OTHELLO
Don’t worry about how I handle it. 
###IAGO
I’ll say goodbye once more. 
## IAGO exits.
###OTHELLO
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior. If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart. Maybe because I’m black, and I don’t have nice manners like courtiers do, or because I’m getting old—but that’s not much—She’s gone, and I’ve been cheated on. I have no choice but to hate her. Oh what a curse marriage is! We think our beautiful wives belong to us, but their desires are free! I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others. This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men. It’s our destiny, like death. We are destined to be betrayed when we are born. Oh, here she comes. 
## DESDEMONA and EMILIA enter.
If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake. I don’t believe it. 
###DESDEMONA
What’s going on, Othello, darling? The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you. 
###OTHELLO
I’m sorry. 
###DESDEMONA
Why are you whispering? Are you sick? 
###OTHELLO
I have a headache, right here in my forehead. 
###DESDEMONA
That’s from lack of sleep. It’ll go away. Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour. (she pulls out a handkerchief) 
###OTHELLO
No, your handkerchief’s too little. Leave my head alone. 
##The handkerchief falls to the floor.
Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner. 
###DESDEMONA
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well. 
## OTHELLO and DESDEMONA exit.
###EMILIA
(picking up the handkerchief) I’m glad I found this handkerchief. It’s the first keepsake the Moor gave her. My stubborn husband has asked me to steal it a 
hundred times. But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it. I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago. Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it. I only try to satisfy his whims. 
## IAGO enters.
###IAGO
What’s going on? What are you doing here alone? 
###EMILIA
Don’t snap at me. I’ve got something for you. 
###IAGO
You’ve got something for me? It’s a common thing— 
###EMILIA
What? 
###IAGO
—to have a stupid wife. 
###EMILIA
Oh, is that so? And what would you give me for the handkerchief? 
###IAGO
What handkerchief? 
###EMILIA
What handkerchief? The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times. 
###IAGO
You stole it from her? 
###EMILIA
No, actually. She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up. Look, here it is. 
###IAGO
Good girl, give it to me. 
###EMILIA
And what are you going to do with it? Why did you want it so much that you begged me to steal it? 
###IAGO
What’s it to you? 
###EMILIA
If you don’t need it for some important reason, then give it back to me. Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing. 
###IAGO
Don’t admit to knowing anything about it. I need it. Now go, leave me. 
## EMILIA exits.
I’ll leave this handkerchief at Cassio’s house and let him find it.To a jealous man, a meaningless little thing like this looks like absolute proof. This handkerchief may be useful to me. The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions. Ideas can be like poisons. At first they hardly even taste bad, but once they get into your blood they start burning like hot lava. 
## OTHELLO enters.
Here he comes. No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night. 
###OTHELLO
Argh! She’s cheating on me? 
###IAGO
Oh, general, please, no more of that! 
###OTHELLO
Get lost! You’ve tortured me with these thoughts. It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little. 
###IAGO
What’s with you, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
I had no idea she was cheating on me. I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me. I slept well, ate well, and was happy. I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips. A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all. 
###IAGO
I’m sorry to hear this. 
###OTHELLO
I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it. Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind! Goodbye to my happiness! Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great! Goodbye! Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war! And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye! Othello’s career is over. 
###IAGO
Is this possible, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
You villain, you’d better be able to prove my wife’s a whore! Be sure of it. Get me proof I can see. If you can’t, trust me, you won’t want to feel my rage! 
###IAGO
Has it come to this? 
###OTHELLO
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt. If you can’t, your life is worthless! 
###IAGO
My noble lord— 
###OTHELLO
If you’re slandering her just to torture me, then it’ll be no use to pray for mercy or say you’re sorry. You might as well go ahead and commit every unspeakable crime you can think of, because there’s nothing you could that would top what you’ve already done! 
###IAGO
Oh, heaven help me! Aren’t you a rational human being? Don’t you have any sense at all? Goodbye. I resign my official position. I’m such an idiot for always telling the truth! What a horrible world we live in! Listen, pay attention, everybody. It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest. I’m glad you’ve taught me this valuable lesson. From now on, I’ll never try to help a friend when it hurts him so much to hear the truth. 
###OTHELLO
No, stop. You should always be honest. 
###IAGO
I should always be wise. Honesty’s stupid, it makes me lose my friends even when I’m trying to help them. 
###OTHELLO
I swear, I think my wife’s faithful, and I think she’s not. I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next. I need proof! Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face. As long as there are ropes, knives, poison, fire, or streams to drown in, I won’t stand for this. Oh, how I wish I knew the truth! 
###IAGO
I see you’re all eaten up with emotion. I’m sorry I said anything. You want proof? 
###OTHELLO
Want? Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it. 
###IAGO
But how? How will you get proof? Are you going to hide and watch them having sex? 
###OTHELLO
Death and damnation! Oh! 
###IAGO
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched. If anyone sees them in bed together besides themselves, I guess we could damn them then. So what can we do? What can I say? What proof is there? It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks. But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that. 
###OTHELLO
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me. 
###IAGO
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do. But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going. I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache. Well, some people talk in their sleep, and Cassio is one of them. I heard him saying, “Sweet Desdemona, let’s be careful and hide our love,” in his sleep. And then he grabbed my hand and said, “Oh, my darling!” and 
kissed me hard, as if he were trying to suck my lips off. Then he put his leg over mine, and sighed and kissed me, and said, “Damn fate for giving you to the Moor!” 
###OTHELLO
Oh, that’s monstrous! Monstrous! 
###IAGO
No, it was just a dream. 
###OTHELLO
But it shows that something has already happened. 
###IAGO
It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream. And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy. 
###OTHELLO
I’ll tear her to pieces! 
###IAGO
No, be reasonable. We don’t have any proof yet. She might still be faithful. Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, I gave her one like that. It was my first gift to her. 
###IAGO
I don’t know about that, but I saw a handkerchief like that today. I’m sure it belongs to your wife, and I saw Cassio use it to wipe his beard. 
###OTHELLO
If it’s the same one— 
###IAGO
If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could! Killing him once is not enough revenge. Now I see it’s true. Oh, Iago, all the love I felt is gone, vanished in the wind. Welcome, hatred and vengeance! Get out of my heart, love! My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes! 
###IAGO
Calm down— 
###OTHELLO
I want blood! 
###IAGO
Be patient, I’m telling you. You may change your mind later. 
###OTHELLO
Never, Iago. My thoughts of revenge are flowing through me like a violent river, never turning back to love, only flowing toward full revenge that’ll swallow them up. I swear to God I’ll get revenge. (he kneels) 
###IAGO
Don’t get up yet. Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control. Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent. 
###OTHELLO
I accept your devotion with my deepest love. I’ll put you to the test right away. Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead. 
###IAGO
My friend Cassio is dead. It’s done, because you request it. But let her live. 
###OTHELLO
Damn her, the wicked whore! Oh, damn her, damn her! Come away with me. I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil. You’re my lieutenant now. 
###IAGO
I’m yours forever. 
##They exit.
## DESDEMONA, EMILIA and the CLOWN enter.
###DESDEMONA
Excuse me, do you know which room Lieutenant Cassio lies in? 
###CLOWN
I wouldn’t dare say he lies anywhere. 
###DESDEMONA
Why do you say that? 
###CLOWN
He’s a soldier. If I accused a soldier of lying, he’d stab me. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, come on. Where does he sleep? 
###CLOWN
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying. 
###DESDEMONA
What on earth does that mean? 
###CLOWN
I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying. 
###DESDEMONA
Can you ask around and find out? 
###CLOWN
I’ll go ask questions everywhere. 
###DESDEMONA
Find him and tell him to come here. Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right. 
###CLOWN
I think I can do that. It’s not too much to ask. 
## CLOWN exits.
###DESDEMONA
Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia? 
###EMILIA
I don’t know, madam. 
###DESDEMONA
Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins. This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy. 
###EMILIA
He’s not jealous? 
###DESDEMONA
Who, him? I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land. 
###EMILIA
Look, here he comes. 
## OTHELLO enters.
###DESDEMONA
I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
I’m fine, my lady.—(to himself) Oh, it’s so hard to pretend!—How are you, Desdemona? 
###DESDEMONA
I’m fine, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
Give me your hand. Your hand’s moist, my lady. 
###DESDEMONA
It’s moist because it’s still young and inexperienced. 
###OTHELLO
It says you’re fertile, and you’ve got a giving heart. Hot, hot and moist. With a hand like this you need to 
fast and pray to stave off temptations. Someone with a young sweating hand like this one is bound to act up sooner or later. It’s a nice hand, an open one. 
###DESDEMONA
You’re right to say that. This was the hand that gave you my heart. 
###OTHELLO
This hand gives itself away very freely. In the old days, people used to give their hearts to each other when they joined their hands in marriage. But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts. 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t know about that. Now, don’t forget, you promised me something. 
###OTHELLO
What did I promise, my dear? 
###DESDEMONA
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you. 
###OTHELLO
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me. Lend me your handkerchief. 
###DESDEMONA
Here, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
No, the one I gave you. 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t have it with me. 
###OTHELLO
You don’t? 
###DESDEMONA
No, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
That’s not good. An Egyptian woman gave that handkerchief to my mother. She was a witch, and she could 
almost read people’s thoughts. She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her. But if she lost it or gave it away, my father would start hating her and looking at other women. When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married. I did. So pay attention. Treat it as something precious. Losing it or giving it away would be an unspeakable loss, a loss like none other. 
###DESDEMONA
Is that possible? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, it’s true. There’s magic in its fabric. A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance. The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts. 
###DESDEMONA
Really? Is that true? 
###OTHELLO
It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it. 
###DESDEMONA
I wish I had never seen it! 
###OTHELLO
Ha! Why? 
###DESDEMONA
Why are you yelling at me so angrily? 
###OTHELLO
Is it lost? Is it gone? Tell me, is it missing? 
###DESDEMONA
God help me! 
###OTHELLO
What do you have to say for yourself? 
###DESDEMONA
It’s not lost, but what if it were? 
###OTHELLO
What do you mean? 
###DESDEMONA
I’m telling you, it’s not lost. 
###OTHELLO
Then bring it here. Let me see it. 
###DESDEMONA
I could, sir. But I don’t want to now. This is just a trick to take my mind off what I’m asking you for. Please hire Cassio again. 
###OTHELLO
Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt. 
###DESDEMONA
Come on. You know you’ll never find a more capable man. 
###OTHELLO
The handkerchief! 
###DESDEMONA
He’s counted on your friendship for his success. He’s shared dangers with you— 
###OTHELLO
The handkerchief! 
###DESDEMONA
Really, I don’t think you’re behaving very well. 
###OTHELLO
Damn it! 
## OTHELLO exits.
###EMILIA
And you say he’s not jealous? 
###DESDEMONA
I never saw him like this before. There must be some magic in that handkerchief. I’m miserable that I lost it. 
###EMILIA
Men are all the same, but it takes longer than a year or two to see how bad they are. They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food. They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up. Look, here comes Cassio and my husband. 
## IAGO and CASSIO enter.
###IAGO
There’s no other way. She’s the one who’s got to do it. And what luck, she’s here! Go ahead and ask her. 
###DESDEMONA
Hello, Cassio. How are you? 
###CASSIO
Nothing, madam. Just my earlier request. I’m begging you to help me get back on his good side. I’m devoted to him with all my heart. I can’t wait any longer. If my wrongdoing was so serious that I can’t get back into his good graces either by my past service, or my present situation, or the promise of devoted service in the future, just knowing that would help me. Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career. 
###DESDEMONA
I’m sorry, dear Cassio, but now is not the right time to bring up your case. My husband’s not himself. If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him. God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive. You’ll just have to be patient for a little while. I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself. Let that be enough for you. 
###IAGO
Is Othello angry? 
###EMILIA
He just left, clearly upset about something. 
###IAGO
Can he even get angry? It’s hard to believe. I’ve seen him stay calm when cannons were blowing his soldiers to bits, even killing his own brother without him batting an eyelid—is he really upset? It must be about something important. I’ll go talk to him. If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong. 
###DESDEMONA
Please, do so. 
## IAGO exits.
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood. Men always get angry about little things when they’re really worried about bigger ones. That’s the way it goes. When our finger hurts, it makes the rest of the body hurt too. We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday. Oh, Emilia, I’m so inexperienced that I thought he was being unkind, but actually I was judging him harshly. 
###EMILIA
I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh no! I never gave him reason to be jealous. 
###EMILIA
But jealous people don’t think like that. They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous. It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing. 
###DESDEMONA
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind! 
###EMILIA
Amen to that, lady. 
###DESDEMONA
I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here. If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can. 
###CASSIO
I thank you, lady. 
## DESDEMONA and EMILIA exit.
## BIANCA enters.
###BIANCA
Hello, Cassio! 
###CASSIO
Why are you so far from home? How are you, my pretty Bianca? To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house. 
###BIANCA
And I was just going to yours. You’ve kept away from me for a week? Seven days and seven nights? A hundred and sixty-eight hours? And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones! What a tedious wait! 
###CASSIO
I’m sorry, Bianca. All this time I’ve been depressed and had problems on my mind. When I get some free time I’ll make it up to you. (he gives her DESDEMONA ’s handkerchief) Sweet Bianca, would you copy this embroidery pattern for me? 
###BIANCA
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this? This is a gift from another woman, a new lover! Now I know why you’ve been staying away from me. Has it come to this? Well, well. 
###CASSIO
Oh, come on, woman. Stop jumping to silly conclusions. Now you’re jealous, thinking that this is from some mistress of mine, but I swear it’s not, Bianca. 
###BIANCA
Well, whose is it? 
###CASSIO
I don’t even know. I found it in my room. It’s pretty. Someone is certainly looking for it, and I’ll have to give it back. So I’d like it copied. Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while. 
###BIANCA
Leave you alone! Why? 
###CASSIO
I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman. 
###BIANCA
And why’s that? 
###CASSIO
It’s not because I don’t love you. 
###BIANCA
But you don’t love me. Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight. 
###CASSIO
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here. But I’ll see you soon. 
###BIANCA
All right, have it your way. I have to make do. 
##They exit.
## OTHELLO and IAGO enter.
###IAGO
Do you really think so? 
###OTHELLO
What do you mean, do I think so? 
###IAGO
What, just because they kissed in private? 
###OTHELLO
An illicit kiss! 
###IAGO
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything. 
###OTHELLO
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything? Come on, Iago. That would be like playing a trick on the devil: they’d make him think they’re going to commit adultery, but then back off. Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them. 
###IAGO
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin. But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— 
###OTHELLO
Then what? 
###IAGO
Then it’s hers. And if it’s hers, I guess she can give it to any man she wants. 
###OTHELLO
Her reputation is also her own. Can she give that away too? 
###IAGO
You can’t see a reputation. A lot of people don’t even deserve the reputations they have. But a handkerchief— 
###OTHELLO
God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief! What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief! 
###IAGO
Yes, what about it? 
###OTHELLO
That’s not good. 
###IAGO
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you? Or heard him say something about it. You know there are jerks out there who have to brag about bedding some woman.— 
###OTHELLO
Has he said anything? 
###IAGO
Yes, but he’d deny it all. 
###OTHELLO
What did he say? 
###IAGO
He said he did—I don’t know. 
###OTHELLO
He what? 
###IAGO
He was in bed with— 
###OTHELLO
With her? 
###IAGO
With her, on top of her—however you want to say it. 
###OTHELLO
In bed with her? On top of her? I would have thought people were telling lies about her rather than believe he was lying on her. My God, it’s nauseating! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! I’ll kill him first, and then let him confess—I’m trembling with rage. I wouldn’t be trembling like this if I didn’t know deep down this was all true. Noses, ears, lips. Is it possible? Tell me the truth—Handkerchief—Damn it! 
##(he falls into a trance)
###IAGO
Keep working, poison! This is the way to trick gullible fools. Many good and innocent women are punished for reasons like this.—My lord? My lord, Othello! 
## CASSIO enters.
Hey, Cassio! 
###CASSIO
What’s the matter? 
###IAGO
Othello’s having some kind of epileptic fit. This is his second fit like this. He had one yesterday. 
###CASSIO
Rub his temples. 
###IAGO
No, don’t. This fit has to run its course. If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy. Look, he’s moving. Why don’t you go away for a bit? He’ll get 
better right away. When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you. 
## CASSIO exits.
What happened, general? Did you hit your head? 
###OTHELLO
Are you making fun of me? 
###IAGO
Making fun of you? No, I swear! I wish you could face your bad news like a man! 
###OTHELLO
A man who’s been cheated on isn’t a real man. He’s subhuman, like an animal. 
###IAGO
In that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city. 
###OTHELLO
Did he confess? 
###IAGO
Sir, be a man. Every married man has been cheated on. Millions of men sleep with wives who cheat on them, wrongly believing they belong to them alone. Your case is better than that. At least you’re not ignorant. The worst thing of all is to kiss your wife thinking she’s innocent, when in fact she’s a whore. No, I’d rather know the truth. Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am. 
###OTHELLO
You’re wise! That’s for sure. 
###IAGO
Go somewhere else for a while. Calm down. While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here. I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance. I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would. So hide here and watch how he sneers 
at you. I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future. I’m telling you, just watch his face. But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man. 
###OTHELLO
Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago? I’ll be very patient, but—do you hear me?—I’m not done with him yet 
###IAGO
That’s fine, but for now keep your cool. Will you go hide? 
## OTHELLO hides.
Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes. She’s crazy about Cassio. That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one. Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing. 
## CASSIO enters.
And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy. In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant? 
###CASSIO
It doesn’t make me feel any better when you call me lieutenant. I’m dying to have that title back again. 
###IAGO
Just keep asking Desdemona, and it’ll be yours. If it was up to Bianca to get you your job back, you’d have had it already! 
###CASSIO
The poor thing! 
###OTHELLO
He’s laughing already! 
###IAGO
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much. 
###CASSIO
The poor thing, I really think she loves me. 
###OTHELLO
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off. 
###IAGO
Have you heard this, Cassio? 
###OTHELLO
He’s asking him to tell the story again. Go on, tell it. 
###IAGO
She says you’re going to marry her. Are you? 
###CASSIO
Ha, ha, ha! 
###OTHELLO
Are you laughing because you’ve won? Do you think you’ve won? 
###CASSIO
Me, marry her? That whore? Please give me a little credit! I’m not that stupid. Ha, ha, ha! 
###OTHELLO
So, so, so, so! The winner’s always got the last laugh, hasn’t he? 
###IAGO
I swear, there’s a rumor going around that you’ll marry her. 
###CASSIO
You’re kidding! 
###IAGO
If it’s not true, you can call me a villain. 
###OTHELLO
Have you given me bastard children to raise? All right, then. 
###CASSIO
The little monkey must have started that rumor herself. She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me. She’s just flattering herself. I never promised her anything. 
###OTHELLO
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer. Now he’s telling the story. 
###CASSIO
She was here just now. She hangs around me all the time. I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up. I swear to you, she put her arms around me like this— 
###OTHELLO
Saying, “Oh, Cassio,” it seems, judging by his gestures. 
###CASSIO
She hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries, shaking me and pulling at me. Ha, ha, ha! 
###OTHELLO
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom. Oh, I can see your nose now. But I can’t see the dog I’m going to throw it to. 
###CASSIO
I have to get rid of her. 
###IAGO
Look out, here she comes. 
## BIANCA enters.
###CASSIO
It’s a whore like all the others, stinking of cheap perfume.—Why are you always hanging around me? 
###BIANCA
Damn you! What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief? I was an idiot to take it! You want me to copy the embroidery pattern? That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to. This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you? Give it back to her, I won’t do anything with it. 
###CASSIO
What is it, my dear Bianca? What’s wrong? 
###OTHELLO
My God, that’s my handkerchief! 
###BIANCA
If you want to come have dinner with me, you can. If you don’t want to, then good riddance. 
## BIANCA exits.
###IAGO
Go after her, go. 
###CASSIO
Actually, I should. She’ll scream in the streets if I don’t. 
###IAGO
Will you be having dinner with her tonight? 
###CASSIO
Yes, I will. 
###IAGO
Well, maybe I’ll see you there. I’d really like to speak with you. 
###CASSIO
Please come. Will you? 
###IAGO
Don’t talk anymore, go after her. 
## CASSIO exits.
###OTHELLO
(coming forward) How should I murder him, Iago? 
###IAGO
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her? 
###OTHELLO
Oh Iago! 
###IAGO
And did you see the handkerchief? 
###OTHELLO
Was it mine? 
###IAGO
It was yours, I swear. And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him? She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore. 
###OTHELLO
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight. Oh, she’s a fine woman! A fair woman! A sweet woman! 
###IAGO
No, you have to forget all that now. 
###OTHELLO
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight. She won’t stay alive for long. No, my heart’s turned to stone—when I hit it, it hurts my hand. Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature. She could be married to an emperor, and he’d be like her slave! 
###IAGO
But that’s not how you’re going to be. 
###OTHELLO
Damn her, I’m just describing her truthfully! She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician. Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep! Oh, she’s so witty and creative! 
###IAGO
All the worse that she stooped this low, then. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has! 
###IAGO
Yes, a little too sweet. 
###OTHELLO
Yes, that’s for sure. Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago! 
###IAGO
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you? If it doesn’t bother you, it won’t bother anyone else. 
###OTHELLO
I’ll chop her into pieces. How could she cheat on me? 
###IAGO
Oh, it’s horrible of her. 
###OTHELLO
And with my own officer! 
###IAGO
That’s worse. 
###OTHELLO
Get me some poison tonight, Iago. I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago. 
###IAGO
Don’t do it with poison. Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated. 
###OTHELLO
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair! Very good! 
###IAGO
And let me kill Cassio. You’ll hear more from me by midnight. 
###OTHELLO
Excellent, good. 
##A trumpet sounds offstage.
What’s that trumpet for? 
###IAGO
I think someone’s coming from Venice. It’s Lodovico. He must be coming from the duke. Look, your wife is with him. 
## LODOVICO, DESDEMONA and attendants enter.
###LODOVICO
Greetings, good general! 
###OTHELLO
Greetings, sir. 
###LODOVICO
The duke and senators of Venice greet you. 
##(he hands OTHELLO a piece of paper)
###OTHELLO
I’ll do whatever they order me to do in this letter. 
###DESDEMONA
What’s new, cousin Lodovico? 
###IAGO
Very nice to see you, sir. Welcome to Cyprus. 
###LODOVICO
Thank you. How is lieutenant Cassio? 
###IAGO
Well, he’s alive. 
###DESDEMONA
Cousin, there’s been a falling out between him and Othello. An unfortunate rift, but you can fix it. 
###OTHELLO
Are you sure of that? 
###DESDEMONA
Excuse me? 
###OTHELLO
(reading) “Don’t fail to do this, since you’ll—” 
###LODOVICO
He didn’t say anything, he’s reading. So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio? 
###DESDEMONA
Yes, unfortunately. I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio. 
###OTHELLO
Damn it all! 
###DESDEMONA
Excuse me, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
Are you in your right mind? 
###DESDEMONA
Is he angry? 
###LODOVICO
Maybe the letter upset him. I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place. 
###DESDEMONA
I’m happy about that. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, are you really! 
###DESDEMONA
My lord? 
###OTHELLO
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me. 
###DESDEMONA
Why, sweet Othello— 
###OTHELLO
(striking her) You devil! 
###DESDEMONA
I haven’t done anything to deserve this! 
###LODOVICO
My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes. That was too much. You should apologize. She’s crying. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, you devil, you devil! You can cry all day and all night, and I still won’t believe you’re sad. Get out of my sight! 
###DESDEMONA
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry. 
###LODOVICO
She’s obedient—a fine lady. Please, my lord, call her back. 
###OTHELLO
Madam! 
###DESDEMONA
My lord? 
###OTHELLO
What do you want with her, sir? 
###LODOVICO
Who, me? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, you asked me to call her back. See how well she can turn? She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again. And she can cry, sir—oh, how she can cry! And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient. Very obedient—keep crying.—Concerning this—oh, what fake emotion!—I am being ordered home—Get away from me, I’ll send for you later.—Sir, I’ll obey the order and return to Venice. Get away from me, you witch! 
## DESDEMONA exits.
Cassio can have my job. And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me. Welcome to Cyprus. Horny animals! 
## OTHELLO exits.
###LODOVICO
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable? Is this the guy who’s supposed to never get emotional, and who never gets rattled, no matter what disaster happens? 
###IAGO
He’s changed a great deal. 
###LODVICO
Is he sane? Is he losing his mind? 
###IAGO
He is what he is. I won’t say anything negative about what he might be. If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were! 
###LODOVICO
Hitting his wife? 
###IAGO
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do. But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it! 
###LODOVICO
Is it a habit of his? Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it? 
###IAGO
Oh, it’s too bad! It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard. You’ll see what he’s like. His own actions will show you what kind of person he is, so I won’t have to bother telling you. Just go after him and watch what he does next. 
###LODOVICO
I’m sorry I was so wrong about him. 
##They exit.
## OTHELLO and EMILIA enter.
###OTHELLO
You haven’t seen anything, then? 
###EMILIA
No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all. 
###OTHELLO
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together. 
###EMILIA
Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said. 
###OTHELLO
Didn’t they ever whisper? 
###EMILIA
Never, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
Or ask you to leave the room? 
###EMILIA
Never. 
###OTHELLO
Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything? 
###EMILIA
No, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
That’s strange. 
###EMILIA
I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good, honest person, sir. If you suspect otherwise, stop thinking that right now because you’re wrong. If any jerk has tried to convince you she’s bad, I hope God curses him. If she’s not honest, faithful, and true, then there’s no such thing as a faithful wife or a happy husband. 
###OTHELLO
Tell her to come here. Go. 
## EMILIA exits.
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story. Desdemona’s a tricky whore with a closet full of awful secrets, but still she’ll kneel and pray like an honest woman. I’ve seen her do it. 
## DESDEMONA and EMILIA enter.
###DESDEMONA
My lord, what do you want? 
###OTHELLO
Please, dear, come here. 
###DESDEMONA
What can I do for you? 
###OTHELLO
Let me see your eyes. Look at my face. 
###DESDEMONA
What horrible thing are you imagining? 
###OTHELLO
(to EMILIA) Go do what you do best, madam. Leave us alone for our hanky-panky, and shut the door behind you. If somebody comes, give a shout. That’s your job, your job. Go on, hurry! 
## EMILIA exits.
###DESDEMONA
I’m begging you on my knees to tell me what your words mean. I can tell you’re furious, but I don’t understand what you’re saying. 
###OTHELLO
Why? Who are you? 
###DESDEMONA
I’m your wife, your true and loyal wife. 
###OTHELLO
Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying. Otherwise the devils will mistake you for an angel and be too scared to grab you. Go ahead, make sure you damn yourself by swearing you’ve been faithful to me. 
###DESDEMONA
Heaven knows I am. 
###OTHELLO
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell. 
###DESDEMONA
Unfaithful, my lord? With whom? How am I unfaithful? 
###OTHELLO
Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away! 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, what a horrible day! Why are you crying? Because of me? If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me. You may have lost his respect, but so have I. 
###OTHELLO
If God had decided to treat me like Job, making me sick and covered with sores, reducing me to abject poverty, selling me into slavery and destroying all my hopes, I would have found some way to accept it with patience. But instead He’s made me a laughingstock for everyone in our time to point at and scorn! Even that I could put up with. But instead, my wife, who’s supposed to 
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me! Worse than that, she’s polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce! Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient—it’s too horrifying! 
###DESDEMONA
I hope you think I’m faithful to you. 
###OTHELLO
As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows. You’re like a weed pretending to be a flower, so beautiful and sweet-smelling that I ache when I look at you. Oh, I wish you’d never been born! 
###DESDEMONA
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it? 
###OTHELLO
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore? What have you done? What have you done? Oh, you streetwalker! If I said out loud what you’ve done, you’d burn up with shame. What have you done? Heaven has to hold its nose when it sees you! The pure moon in the sky has to shut its eyes when you go by! Even the wind that blows over everything on earth is ashamed to visit you. You brazen whore! 
###DESDEMONA
I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly! 
###OTHELLO
So you’re saying you’re not a whore? 
###DESDEMONA
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian. If only letting my husband touch my body means I’m not a whore, I’m not a whore. 
###OTHELLO
What, you’re not a whore? 
###DESDEMONA
No, I swear it. 
###OTHELLO
Is that possible? 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, heaven help us! 
###OTHELLO
I beg your pardon then. I must have the wrong woman. I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper. 
## EMILIA enters.
You’re in charge of this hell! You! We’ve finished our business. Here’s some money for you. Please lock the door and keep quiet. 
## OTHELLO exits.
###EMILIA
What’s he talking about? How are you, madam? 
###DESDEMONA
I’m stunned, to tell you the truth. 
###EMILIA
My lady, what’s wrong with your husband? 
###DESDEMONA
With who? 
###EMILIA
Why, with your husband, madam. My lord. 
###DESDEMONA
Who’s your lord? 
###EMILIA
My lord is your lord. 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t have a lord. Don’t talk to me, Emilia. I can’t even cry, though tears are the only answers I could give to all your questions. Tonight put my wedding sheets on my bed, and tell your husband to come to me now. 
###EMILIA
Things have certainly changed! 
## EMILIA exits.
###DESDEMONA
It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair. What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about? 
## IAGO and EMILIA enter.
###IAGO
What can I do for you, madam? How are you? 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t know. When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily. He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child. 
###IAGO
What’s the matter, lady? 
###EMILIA
He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it. 
###DESDEMONA
Am I that name, Iago? 
###IAGO
What name, madam? 
###DESDEMONA
What my lord said I was. 
###EMILIA
He called her a whore. A beggar couldn’t have called his slut worse names. 
###IAGO
Why did he do that? 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t know. I just know I’m not one. 
###IAGO
Don’t cry, don’t cry. What a day this is! 
###EMILIA
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore? Doesn’t that make you want to cry? 
###DESDEMONA
It’s just my bad luck. 
###IAGO
Damn him! How did he get such an idea? 
###DESDEMONA
Heaven knows. 
###EMILIA
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position. I bet my life on it. 
###IAGO
Nobody’s that bad. It’s impossible. 
###DESDEMONA
If there is, then heaven help him! 
###EMILIA
A hangman’s noose will help him! Let hell chew him up! Why should he call her a whore? Who’s been with her? When has she had the time, the place, or the means to sleep with anyone? How is this at all likely? The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard. Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with! 
###IAGO
Keep your voice down. 
###EMILIA
Oh, to hell with those people! It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor. 
###IAGO
You’re a fool. Shut up. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again? Please go to him, my friend. I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me. Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or don’t love him now—even though he tries to shake me off— 
then I hope I have a life of misery! Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love. I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now. I wouldn’t do the thing that would make me a whore for all the money in the world. 
###IAGO
Please calm down. He’s just in a bad mood. Political business is bothering him, and he’s just taking it out on you. 
###DESDEMONA
If only that were all it is— 
###IAGO
It is, I promise. 
##Trumpets sound.
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner. The Venetians are waiting for their food. Go in, and don’t cry. Everything will be all right. 
## DESDEMONA and EMILIA exit.
## RODERIGO enters.
How are you, Roderigo? 
###RODERIGO
I don’t think you’re treating me fairly. 
###IAGO
What makes you say that? 
###RODERIGO
Every day you put me off with some trick. Instead of finding opportunities for me, you seem to be preventing me from making any progress. 
Well, I won’t take it any longer. And I’m not going to sit back and accept what you’ve done. 
###IAGO
Will you listen to me, Roderigo? 
###RODERIGO
I’ve listened to you too much already. Your words and actions don’t match up. 
###IAGO
That’s not fair. 
###RODERIGO
It’s the truth. I’ve got no money left. The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me. You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens. 
###IAGO
Well, all right then. Fine. 
###RODERIGO
“Fine!” he says. “All right!” It’s not fine, and I’m not all right! It’s wrong, and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated! 
###IAGO
Okay. 
###RODERIGO
It’s not okay! I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings. If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her. If not, I’ll challenge you to a duel. 
###IAGO
You’ve said what you have to say now. 
###RODERIGO
Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said. 
###IAGO
Well, all right then. Now I see that you have some guts. From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before. Give me your hand, Roderigo. Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you. 
###RODERIGO
It doesn’t look that way to me. 
###IAGO
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart. But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer. If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me. 
###RODERIGO
Well, what’s your plan? Is it feasible? 
###IAGO
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus. 
###RODERIGO
Is that true? Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice. 
###IAGO
Oh, no. He’ll go to Mauritania and take the beautiful Desdemona with him, unless he gets stuck here for some reason. The best way to extend his stay here is to get rid of Cassio. 
###RODERIGO
What do you mean, get rid of him? 
###IAGO
I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place. 
###RODERIGO
And that’s what you want me to do! 
###IAGO
Yes, if you want to help yourself. He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him. He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet. When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him. I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him. Come on, don’t stand there in a daze. Come along with me. I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out. It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted. Let’s go! 
###RODERIGO
I want to hear more about this. 
###IAGO
You will. You’ll hear all you want to hear. 
##They exit.
## OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA and EMILIA enter, with attendants.
###LODOVICO
Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself. 
###OTHELLO
I beg your pardon; walking will make me feel better. 
###LODOVICO
Good night, madam. Thank you. 
###DESDEMONA
You’re most welcome. 
###OTHELLO
Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— 
###DESDEMONA
Yes, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
Go to bed right this minute. I’ll be there shortly. Send your maid Emilia away. Make sure you do what I say. 
###DESDEMONA
I will, my lord. 
##     OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and attendants exit.
###EMILIA
How are things now? He looks calmer than he did before. 
###DESDEMONA
He says he’ll come back right away. He asked me to go to bed and to send you away. 
###EMILIA
Send me away? 
###DESDEMONA
That’s what he said. So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and I’ll say goodnight. We shouldn’t displease him. 
###EMILIA
Yes. I wish you’d never met him. 
###DESDEMONA
That’s not what I wish. I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods. 
###EMILIA
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked. 
###DESDEMONA
It doesn’t matter. Oh, how silly we are! If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin. 
###EMILIA
Listen to you! Don’t be silly! 
###DESDEMONA
My mother had a maid named Barbary. She was in love, and her lover turned out to be wild and left her. She knew an old song called “Willow” that reminded her of her own story, and she died singing it. I can’t get that song out of my head tonight. It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary. Please, hurry up. 
###EMILIA
Should I get your nightgown? 
###DESDEMONA
No, just help me unpin this. That Lodovico is a good-looking man. 
###EMILIA
He’s very handsome. 
###DESDEMONA
He speaks well. 
###EMILIA
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him. 
###DESDEMONA
(singing)  The poor soul sat singing by the sycamore tree,  Everyone sing the green willow,  She had her hand on her breast and her head on her knee,  Sing willow, willow, willow.  The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans,  Sing willow, willow, willow.  Her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones,  Sing willow, willow, willow.—  Put these things over there.—  Please, hurry, he’ll come right away.—  Everyone sing, a green willow must be my garland.  Nobody blame him, he’s right to hate me— No, that’s not how it goes.—Who’s knocking? 
###EMILIA
It’s the wind. 
###DESDEMONA
(singing) I told my lover he didn’t love me, but what did he say? Sing willow, willow, willow. If I chase more women, you’ll sleep with more men—Okay, go away now. Good night. My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon? 
###EMILIA
No, it doesn’t mean anything. 
###DESDEMONA
I heard someone say that’s what it means. Oh, these men, these men! Do you honestly think—tell me, Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner? 
###EMILIA
There are women like that out there, no question. 
###DESDEMONA
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world? 
###EMILIA
Why, wouldn’t you? 
###DESDEMONA
By the light of heaven, no, I would not! 
###EMILIA
I wouldn’t either, by daylight. It would be easier to do it in the dark. 
###DESDEMONA
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world? 
###EMILIA
The world’s huge. It’s a big prize for such a small sin. 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t think you would. 
###EMILIA
Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it. I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats. But for the whole world? Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king? I’d risk my soul for that. 
###DESDEMONA
I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world! 
###EMILIA
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then. 
###DESDEMONA
I don’t think any woman like that exists. 
###EMILIA
Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact. But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them. For instance, our husbands 
may stop sleeping with us, and give it out to other women instead. Or they may get insanely jealous, and keep us from going anywhere. Or let’s say they hit us, or cut back on the money they give us out of spite. We have feelings. We may be able to forgive them, but we want to get back at them too. Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too. They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands. Why do they replace us with other women? Do they do it for fun? I think they do. Is it out of lust? I think so. Is it a weakness? It is. And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men? Then tell them to treat us well. Or let them figure out that the bad things we do are just what we learned from them. 
###DESDEMONA
Good night, good night. I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it! 
##They exit.
## IAGO and RODERIGO enter.
###IAGO
Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away. Keep your sword out, and then stick it in as far as it’ll go. Quick, quick. Don’t be afraid. I’ll be right next to you. This will either make us or break us. Keep that in mind, and be steady. 
###RODERIGO
Stay right near me. I may mess it up. 
###IAGO
I’m right behind you. Be bold, and get ready. 
## IAGO moves aside.
###RODERIGO
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons. I guess it’s only one man—no big deal. My sword comes out, and he dies. 
###IAGO
(to himself) I’ve rubbed this young pimple until he’s ready to pop, and now he’s angry. Whether he kills Cassio, or Cassio kills him, or they kill each other, it all works in my favor. If Roderigo survives, though, he’ll ask me for all the gold and jewelry that I stole from him and said I gave to Desdemona. I can’t let that happen. If Cassio survives,he’s so handsome and well-spoken that he makes me look ugly. And besides, the Moor might tell him about my lies about him.—That would be very dangerous for me. No, he’s got to die. Let it be so. I hear him coming. 
## CASSIO enters.
###RODERIGO
I know the sound of his walk.—Die, villain! 
## RODERIGO thrusts his sword at CASSIO.
###CASSIO
That thrust might really have hurt me if I didn’t have this armor on under my cloak. Now let’s see what you’ve got on. 
## CASSIOdraws his sword and stabs Roderigo.
###RODERIGO
Oh, I’m dead! 
##From behind, IAGO stabs CASSIO in the leg and then exits.
###CASSIO
I’ll be crippled forever! Help! Murder! murder! 
## OTHELLO enters.
###OTHELLO
That’s Cassio’s voice. Iago has kept his word. 
###RODERIGO
Oh, what a villain I am! 
###OTHELLO
That’s the truth. 
###CASSIO
Help me! Get some light! Get me a surgeon! 
###OTHELLO
It’s him! Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are! You even went as far as murder to help your friend in his misfortune. You teach me how I should act. 
Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon. I’m coming, slut! I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart. You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood. 
## OTHELLO exits.
## LODOVICO and GRATIANO enter.
###CASSIO
Help! Isn’t there a guard around? No one passing by? Murder! Murder! 
###GRATIANO
Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked. 
###CASSIO
Oh, help! 
###LODOVICO
Listen! 
###RODERIGO
I’ve acted like such a villain! 
###LODOVICO
Two or three men are groaning. But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap. It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help. 
###RODERIGO
Nobody’s coming? I’ll bleed to death. 
###LODOVICO
Look! 
## IAGO enters.
###GRATIANO
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons. 
###IAGO
Who’s there? Who’s shouting “murder”? 
###LODOVICO
We don’t know. 
###IAGO
Didn’t you hear someone shouting? 
###CASSIO
I’m here, here! For heaven’s sake, help me! 
###IAGO
What’s the matter? 
###GRATIANO
(to LODOVICO) That’s Othello’s ensign, I think. 
###LODOVICO
It is. He’s a good man. 
###IAGO
(to CASSIO) Who’s shouting so loudly? 
###CASSIO
Is that you, Iago? I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains! Help me. 
###IAGO
Oh, lieutenant! What villains did this to you? 
###CASSIO
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away. 
###IAGO
The treacherous criminals!—(to LODOVICO and GRATIANO) Who’s there? Come here and help! 
###RODERIGO
Somebody help me over here! 
###CASSIO
That’s one of them. 
###IAGO
(to RODERIGO) Murderer! Villain! 
## IAGO stabs RODERIGO.
###RODERIGO
Damned Iago! You inhuman dog! 
###IAGO
Killing men in the dark? Where are these murderers? This is such a quiet, sleepy town!—Murder, murder!—Who’s that coming? Are you good or evil? 
###LODOVICO
Judge for yourself. 
###IAGO
Signor Lodovico? 
###LODOVICO
That’s me. 
###IAGO
I beg your pardon. Cassio’s been wounded. 
###GRATIANO
Cassio! 
###IAGO
How are you doing, brother? 
###CASSIO
My leg’s been cut in two. 
###IAGO
God forbid! Bring me some light, gentlemen, I’ll bind the wound with my shirt. 
## BIANCA enters.
###BIANCA
What’s the matter? Who’s shouting? 
###IAGO
Who’s shouting? 
###BIANCA
Oh, my dear Cassio! My sweet Cassio! Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! 
###IAGO
You notorious whore! Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this? 
###CASSIO
No. 
###GRATIANO
I’m sorry to find you like this. I’ve been looking all over for you. 
###IAGO
Lend me your sash—Oh, if we only had a stretcher to carry him out of here! 
###BIANCA
He’s fainted! Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! 
###IAGO
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light. Do you recognize this face? Oh, no, it’s my friend and countryman, Roderigo.—Yes, it’s Roderigo! 
###GRATIANO
What, Roderigo from Venice? 
###IAGO
That’s the one, sir. Do you know him? 
###GRATIANO
Know him? Yes. 
###IAGO
Signor Gratiano, I beg your pardon. I didn’t mean to ignore you—it’s just because of this bloody uproar. 
###GRATIANO
I’m glad to see you. 
###IAGO
How are you doing, Cassio?—Someone bring me a stretcher! 
###GRATIANO
Roderigo! 
###IAGO
It’s him, it’s him. 
##A stretcher is brought in.
Good—here’s the stretcher. Get somebody strong to carry him out of here. I’ll get the general’s surgeon. (to BIANCA) As for you, ma'am, don’t bother. The man lying here was my dear friend, Roderigo.—What was the problem between you? 
###CASSIO
There wasn’t any problem. I don’t even know him. 
###IAGO
(to BIANCA) You’re pale?—Get Cassio out of here.—You look awfully pale, Bianca. 
## CASSIO and RODERIGO are carried away.
Do you see how afraid she is? Watch her, we’ll get the whole story. Keep an eye on her. Do you see? The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent. 
## EMILIA enters.
###EMILIA
What’s the matter? What’s the matter, husband? 
###IAGO
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped. He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already. 
###EMILIA
Oh, no, good gentleman! Oh no, good Cassio! 
###IAGO
This is what happens when you visit whores. Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—(to BIANCA) What, does that make you nervous? 
###BIANCA
He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous. 
###IAGO
Oh, did he? I order you to come with me. 
###EMILIA
Go to hell, you whore! 
###BIANCA
I’m no whore. I’m as moral as you are. 
###EMILIA
As moral as me! Damn you! 
###IAGO
Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story. Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now? (to himself) This is the night that’ll either make me or break me. 
##They all exit.
## DESDEMONA is asleep in bed. OTHELLO enters with a candle.
###OTHELLO
I have to do it, I have to do it. I have to keep my reason in mind. I won’t say out loud what my reason is, but I have to do it. But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble. But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men. Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart. If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it. But once I kill you, you beautiful, fake woman, I do not know the magic that could bring you back. When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die. Let me smell you while you’re still on the tree. (he kisses her) Oh, that sweet breath almost convinces me not to kill you and carry out justice. One more, one more kiss. If you’re this beautiful when you’re dead, I’ll kill you and then love you afterward. (kissing her) One more, and this is the last. Such a sweet kiss was never so deadly. I have to cry, but I have to be cruel too. I’m acting like God in the Old Testament—I have to punish the one I love. She’s waking up. 
###DESDEMONA
Who’s there? Othello? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, Desdemona. 
###DESDEMONA
Will you come to bed, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
Have you said your prayers tonight, Desdemona? 
###DESDEMONA
Yes, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
If you can think of any crime you haven’t confessed, then pray for forgiveness right away. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that? 
###OTHELLO
Well, hurry up and confess. Be quick about it. I’ll wait over here. I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul. No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you. 
###DESDEMONA
You’re talking about killing? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, I am. 
###DESDEMONA
Then heaven have mercy on me. 
###OTHELLO
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart. 
###DESDEMONA
If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me. 
###OTHELLO
Hmmph! 
###DESDEMONA
You’re scaring me. You terrify me when you have that look in your eyes. I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong. But I’m still afraid. 
###OTHELLO
Think of your sins. 
###DESDEMONA
My only sin was loving you too much. 
###OTHELLO
Yes, that’s why you have to die. 
###DESDEMONA
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you. Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that? You’re shaking with emotion. These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future. 
###OTHELLO
Quiet. Stay still. 
###DESDEMONA
I will. What’s this all about? 
###OTHELLO
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio. 
###DESDEMONA
No, I swear by my life and soul! Bring him here and ask him. 
###OTHELLO
My sweet darling, don’t lie. You’re on your deathbed. 
###DESDEMONA
I am? But I’m not dying yet! 
###OTHELLO
Yes, right now. So confess your sin freely now. Even if you swear you’re innocent of every accusation, you won’t change my mind or remove the thought that’s tormenting me. You’re going to die. 
###DESDEMONA
Then heaven have mercy on me! 
###OTHELLO
Amen to that. 
###DESDEMONA
And you have mercy on me too! I never did anything wrong to you in my life. I never loved Cassio, except with the pure love that I feel for humankind. I never gave him any token of romantic love. 
###OTHELLO
I saw him holding the handkerchief! You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice! I saw the handkerchief. 
###DESDEMONA
He found it somewhere, then. I never gave it to him. Tell him to come here. He’ll tell the truth. 
###OTHELLO
He’s already done so. 
###DESDEMONA
What, my lord? 
###OTHELLO
That he had sex with you. 
###DESDEMONA
What? Had sex with me? 
###OTHELLO
Yes. 
###DESDEMONA
He wouldn’t say that. 
###OTHELLO
No. He won’t say anything anymore. Honest Iago’s arranged that. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, I’m scared. What, is he dead? 
###OTHELLO
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined. 
###OTHELLO
What, you whore, are you crying for him right in front of me? 
###DESDEMONA
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me! 
###OTHELLO
Down, whore! 
###DESDEMONA
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight. 
###OTHELLO
No, if you struggle with me— 
###DESDEMONA
Just half an hour! 
###OTHELLO
While I’m doing this, I can’t pause for a moment. 
###DESDEMONA
Just let me say one prayer! 
###OTHELLO
It’s too late. (he smothers her) 
###EMILIA
(offstage) My lord, my lord! Hello! My lord, my lord! 
###OTHELLO
What’s that noise? Aren’t you dead yet? I know I’m cruel, but I’m merciful too. I don’t want you to linger in pain. 
###EMILIA
(offstage) Hello! My lord, my lord! 
###OTHELLO
Who’s there? 
###EMILIA
(offstage) Oh my lord, I need to speak to you! 
###OTHELLO
Yes, it’s Emilia.(to EMILIA)—Just a minute!—She’s dead now.—Emilia’s probably come to tell me that Cassio’s been killed. The fight outside was loud. So! You’re not moving anymore? No, you’re as still as a grave. Should I let her in? Is that a good idea? I think she’s moving again—No. What should I do? If she comes in, she’ll try to speak to my wife. My wife, my wife! What wife? I don’t have a wife. Oh, this is unbearable! Oh, the horror! There should be a huge eclipse of the sun and the moon, now that Desdemona’s no longer on this earth. 
###EMILIA
(offstage) Please, my lord. I need to speak with you. Oh, my good lord! 
###OTHELLO
I’d forgotten about you—Emilia, wait a moment, let me draw the curtains. (closes the bed curtains) Where are you? (unlocks the door) 
## EMILIA enters.
What’s the matter with you now? 
###EMILIA
Oh, my lord, terrible murders have been committed over there! 
###OTHELLO
What? Just now? 
###EMILIA
Yes, just now, my lord. 
###OTHELLO
It’s because of the full moon. It comes too close to the earth and drives men crazy. 
###EMILIA
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo. 
###OTHELLO
Roderigo’s been killed? And Cassio’s killed? 
###EMILIA
No, Cassio wasn’t killed. 
###OTHELLO
Cassio’s not dead? Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong. 
###DESDEMONA
Oh, I’ve been murdered unfairly! 
###EMILIA
Oh Lord, who’s that crying? 
###OTHELLO
That? What? 
###EMILIA
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice. 
## EMILIA opens the bedcurtains.
Help! Help! Oh, lady, speak again. Sweet Desdemona! Oh sweet mistress, speak! 
###DESDEMONA
I’m dying an innocent woman. 
###EMILIA
Oh, who did this thing? 
###DESDEMONA
No one. I did it myself. Give my love to my kind husband. Oh, goodbye! 
## DESDEMONA dies.
###OTHELLO
Why, how could she have been murdered? 
###EMILIA
My God, who knows? 
###OTHELLO
You heard her say it wasn’t me. 
###EMILIA
Yes, she said that. I must go report what happened. 
###OTHELLO
She was lying even as she was going down to hell. I did kill her. 
###EMILIA
Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil! 
###OTHELLO
She cheated on me, and she was a whore. 
###EMILIA
You slander her, you devil. 
###OTHELLO
She was fickle and unfaithful, like water. 
###EMILIA
You’ve lost your mind to accuse her of cheating. She was utterly true to you! 
###OTHELLO
Cassio had sex with her. Ask your husband if you doubt me. If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell. Your husband knew about everything. 
###EMILIA
My husband! 
###OTHELLO
Your husband. 
###EMILIA
He said she was unfaithful? 
###OTHELLO
Yes, with Cassio. If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her. 
###EMILIA
My husband. 
###OTHELLO
Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her. He’s an honest man who detests evil actions. 
###EMILIA
My husband? 
###OTHELLO
Why do you keep repeating that, woman? I’m telling you, your husband. 
###EMILIA
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love! My husband said she was unfaithful! 
###OTHELLO
Yes, him, woman. I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word? My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago. 
###EMILIA
If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever. He’s lying through his teeth! She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that! 
## OTHELLO draws his sword.
###OTHELLO
Ha! 
###EMILIA
Go ahead, do your worst. Killing me won’t send you to heaven. You weren’t good enough for her. 
###OTHELLO
You’d better shut up! 
###EMILIA
I can endure far more pain than you could ever give me! Oh, you idiot! You stupid fool! As dumb as dirt! You’ve committed a terrible evil—I’m not afraid of your sword. I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it 
costs me my life twenty times over.—Help, help, help! The Moor’s killed my mistress! Murder, murder! 
## MONTANO, GRATIANO, and IAGO enter.
###MONTANO
What’s the matter? What’s going on here, general? 
###EMILIA
Oh, are you here, Iago? You’ve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you! 
###GRATIANO
What’s the matter? 
###EMILIA
(to IAGO) Tell this villain he’s wrong, if you’re man enough. He says you told him his wife cheated on him. I know you didn’t. You’re not that much of a villain. Speak, because I’m too emotional to say any more. 
###IAGO
I told him what I thought. I didn’t tell him anything that didn’t make sense or ring true to him. 
###EMILIA
But did you tell him she cheated on him? 
###IAGO
I did. 
###EMILIA
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie. I swear on my soul it was a lie. You said she slept with Cassio. Did you say Cassio? 
###IAGO
Yes, with Cassio. Now be quiet. 
###EMILIA
I will not be quiet! I have to speak. My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— 
###ALL
No, heaven forbid! 
###EMILIA
And your lies caused this murder. 
###OTHELLO
Don’t stand there gaping, everyone. It’s true. 
###GRATIANO
It may be true, but it’s unbelievable. 
###MONTANO
Oh, what a horrible deed! 
###EMILIA
Evil, evil, evil! I can smell it! I suspected it earlier. I’ll kill myself out of grief! Oh, evil, evil! 
###IAGO
Are you crazy? I’m ordering you, go home. 
###EMILIA
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak. I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now. Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago! 
###OTHELLO
Oh! Oh! Oh! 
###EMILIA
Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived! 
###OTHELLO
She was filthy! I barely knew you, Uncle Gratiano. Here’s your niece lying here dead. I killed her with these hands. I know this looks horrible. 
###GRATIANO
Poor Desdemona! I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this. Your marriage made him die of grief before his time. If he was alive now, this sight would hurt 
him terribly. It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell. 
###OTHELLO
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times. Cassio confessed it, and she pledged her love to him by giving him the handkerchief I’d given her. I saw it in his hand. It was an old memento that my father gave to my mother. 
###EMILIA
Oh, God! Dear God in heaven! 
###IAGO
Damn it, shut your mouth. 
###EMILIA
No, the truth will come out—Me, shut my mouth? Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up. I’ll say what I have to say. 
###IAGO
If you’re smart, you’ll go home. 
## IAGO draws his sword.
###EMILIA
I won’t. 
###GRATIANO
Shame on you! Drawing your sword on a woman? 
###EMILIA
Oh, you stupid Moor! I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband. He’d begged me to steal it many times. 
###IAGO
You evil whore! 
###EMILIA
You think she gave it to Cassio? No, I found it and gave it to my husband. 
###IAGO
You piece of filth, you’re lying! 
###EMILIA
I swear I’m not lying. (to OTHELLO) Oh, you murderous fool! How did you ever get such a good wife? 
###OTHELLO
Won’t heaven strike this Iago dead? You absolute villain! 
## OTHELLO runs at IAGO. IAGO stabs EMILIA.
###GRATIANO
The woman’s falling down! He’s killed his wife! 
###EMILIA
Yes, yes! Lay me next to my mistress. 
## IAGO exits.
###GRATIANO
He’s gone, and his wife’s dead. 
###MONTANO
He’s a wicked, horrible criminal. Take the Moor’s sword and guard the door from the outside. Kill him rather than let him leave this room. I’m going after Iago. He’s a horrid criminal. 
## MONTANO and GRATIANO exit.
###OTHELLO
I’m not that strong, if a puny nobody can grab my sword. But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did? Let it all go. 
###EMILIA
What did your song mean, lady? Can you hear me? I’ll die like a swan. They sing when they die. (singing) Willow, willow, willow.— Moor, she never cheated on you. She loved you, you cruel man. I swear on my soul I’m telling the truth, and as I say this, I die. 
## EMILIA dies.
###OTHELLO
I’ve got another weapon in the room. It’s a Spanish sword, hardened in ice cold water and razor sharp. Here it is. Uncle, I’m coming out! 
###GRATIANO
(offstage) If you try that, you’ll pay for it. You’ve got no weapon, so you’ll have to suffer. 
###OTHELLO
Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon. 
## GRATIANO enters.
###GRATIANO
What’s the matter? 
###OTHELLO
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have. I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon. But 
who can control his fate? I’m not like that now. Don’t be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon. This is the end of my journey, the end of my life. Are you backing away in fear? There’s no reason to be afraid. You could tap me with a feather and I’d back away. Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you! Such cruel luck! You’re as pale as your nightgown! When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me. You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust. Oh you damned villain! Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight! Blow on me with hot winds, roast me in lava, drown me in liquid fire! Oh, Desdemona! Dead Desdemona! Oh, oh! 
## LODOVICO and MONTANO enter, followed by CASSIO on a stretcher, and officers with IAGO, prisoner.
###LODOVICO
Where is that poor rash man? 
###OTHELLO
You mean the man who used to be Othello? Here I am. 
###LODOVICO
Where’s that snake? Bring the villain forward. 
## IAGO is brought forward.
###OTHELLO
I’m looking to see if you have cloven hooves like the devil. But that’s just a fairy tale. If you are a devil, I won’t be able to kill you. 
## OTHELLO stabs IAGO.
###LODOVICO
Take his sword away from him. 
##They take OTHELLO ’s sword away.
###IAGO
I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me. 
###OTHELLO
I’m not sorry, either. I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness. 
###LODOVICO
Oh Othello, you were once so good, then you were tricked by this villain. What can I say to you? 
###OTHELLO
Say anything. Call me an honorable murderer if you like. I did nothing out of hate, only out of honor. 
###LODOVICO
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan. Did you plan Cassio’s death with him? 
###OTHELLO
Yes. 
###CASSIO
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me. 
###OTHELLO
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me. Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul? 
###IAGO
Don’t ask me anything. You know what you know. From this moment on, I’ll never say another word. 
###LODOVICO
What, not even to pray? 
###GRATIANO
Torture will make you talk. 
###OTHELLO
Well, do your best. 
###LODOVICO
Sir, you’ll understand everything that has happened. I don’t think you know now. Here is a letter we found in Roderigo’s pocket. And here’s another. This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, you villain! 
###CASSIO
Ungodly and monstrous! 
###LODOVICO
Here’s another letter from his pocket, addressed to Iago and full of complaints. We think he was going to send it to Iago, but then Iago stepped in and answered his complaints by killing him. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, you wicked scoundrel! Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief? 
###CASSIO
I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes. 
###OTHELLO
Oh, what a fool I am! 
###CASSIO
Also, in his letter to Iago, Roderigo criticizes Iago for telling him to get me angry while I was on guard duty, and get me demoted. And just now he admitted it, even though he’d seemed to be dead for a long while—Iago tricked him, Iago urged him to do it. 
###LODOVICO
(to OTHELLO) You’ll have to leave this room and come with us. You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus. As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it. You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away. 
###OTHELLO
Wait. A word or two before you go. I’ve given the state of Venice a bit of help in the past, and they know it. But enough about that. When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am. Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility. If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it. I was not easily made jealous, but once I was tricked and manipulated, I worked myself into a frenzy. Describe me as a fool who threw away a precious pearl with his own hands, like a silly Indian who didn’t know what it was worth. As someone who was not emotional, but who then cried a lot. Write all this 
down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this. 
## OTHELLO stabs himself.
###LODOVICO
Oh, what a bloody end to all this! 
###GRATIANO
Everything we’ve heard is bad. 
###OTHELLO
(to DESDEMONA) I kissed you before I killed you. Now, killing myself, I’m dying while I kiss you again. 
## OTHELLO kisses DESDEMONA and dies.
###CASSIO
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon. 
###LODOVICO
(to IAGO) You bloodthirsty dog, you’re crueler than sadness or hunger, crueler than the sea. Look at these dead people on this bed. You did all this. He makes me sick. Take him away. Gratiano, take care of the house, and take the Moor’s property. You’ve inherited everything.—(to CASSIO) Governor, I leave it in your hands to punish this evil villain: just decide the time, the place and the means of torture. And then carry it out! I have to go back to Venice, and tell them about these sad events. 
##They all exit.

## LEONATO, Governor of Messina;HERO, his daughter; and BEATRICE, his niece, enter with a MESSENGER 
###LEONATO
(holding a letter) According to this letter, Don Pedro of Aragon and his army are coming to Messina tonight. 
###MESSENGER
He must be very near by now. When I left him, he was less than nine miles from here. 
###LEONATO
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought? 
###MESSENGER
Not many, and no one important. 
###LEONATO
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely. This letter also says that Don Pedro has given honors to a young man from Florence named Claudio. 
###MESSENGER
Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly. Claudio has done more than anyone would expect of a man his age. He looks like a lamb but fights like a lion. He has so greatly exceeded all expectations that I can’t even describe all he’s done. 
###LEONATO
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news. 
###MESSENGER
I have delivered some letters to his uncle, and he seemed very happy. He got so emotional that he actually looked like he was in pain. 
###LEONATO
Did he start weeping? 
###MESSENGER
Yes, heavily. 
###LEONATO
That’s a very natural display of affection. There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears. And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad! 
###BEATRICE
Please tell me, has Signior Montanto returned from battle? 
###MESSENGER
I don’t know anyone with that name, ma'am. There was no Signior Montanto in our army. 
###LEONATO
Who are you talking about, niece? 
###HERO
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua. 
###MESSENGER
Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever. 
###BEATRICE
Benedick once put up a public notice in Messina challenging Cupid to an archery match. My uncle’s jester accepted the contest on Cupid’s behalf but used toy arrows at the shooting match. But tell me, how many men did he kill and eat in this battle? I promised him I would eat anyone he killed. 
###LEONATO
For God’s sake, Beatrice, you’re criticizing Signior Benedick too heavily. But I’m sure he’ll get even with you. 
###MESSENGER
Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady. 
###BEATRICE
You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it. He’s a very brave eater—he has a strong stomach. 
###MESSENGER
He’s a good soldier too, lady. 
###BEATRICE
He’s a good soldier to a lady? Well then, what is he to a lord? 
###MESSENGER
He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man. He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues. 
###BEATRICE
Absolutely—he is stuffed, like a dummy. As for what he’s stuffed with—well, nobody’s perfect. 
###LEONATO
Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir. Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves. Whenever they meet, there’s a little battle. 
###BEATRICE
And I always win. The last time we fought, he was so dazed by the end that he wasn’t much smarter than his horse. So tell me, who is he hanging around with these days? Every month he has a new best friend. 
###MESSENGER
Is that possible? 
###BEATRICE
It’s entirely possible. He’s incredibly fickle—his affection changes faster than the latest fashions. 
###MESSENGER
I can see you don’t like this gentleman. 
###BEATRICE
No, absolutely not. But please tell me, who’s his best friend? Isn’t there some new swaggering young ruffian who will happily go to hell with Benedick? 
###MESSENGER
He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio. 
###BEATRICE
Oh God, Benedick will plague him like a disease! Benedick is an infection that’s easy to catch but hard to get rid of—and he’ll drive you crazy once you’ve been infected. God help Claudio! If he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured. 
###MESSENGER
I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side, lady. 
###BEATRICE
Do that, my friend. 
###LEONATO
You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my niece. 
###BEATRICE
No, not until we see a hot January. 
###MESSENGER
Don Pedro is here. 
## DON PEDRO, Prince of Aragon, enters with CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,BALTHASAR, andDON JOHNDon John is Don Pedro’s illegitimate half-brother.DON JOHN, the bastard.
###DON PEDRO
My dear Signior Leonato, hosting my whole army is such a huge burden, but you accept it—and me—with open arms. Most people choose to avoid trouble, but you run to it. 
###LEONATO
You are never trouble to this house, your Grace. It’s comforting when trouble departs. But when you leave, you take happiness with you and leave sorrow in its place. 
###DON PEDRO
You take up your duties too cheerfully. (turning to HERO) This must be your daughter. 
###LEONATO
That’s what her mother always tells me. 
###BENEDICK
Did you doubt that she was your daughter, since you had to ask her mother? 
###LEONATO
(teasing) Of course not, Signior Benedick. You were only a child when my daughter was born, and not yet old enough to seduce my wife. 
###DON PEDRO
Ah, he got you back, Benedick! Leonato clearly knows your reputation with women. Seriously, though, the lady resembles Leonato so much that there can be no doubt about who her father is. Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man. 
## LEONATO and DON PEDRO move to one side, still talking.
###BENEDICK
Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders! 
###BEATRICE
I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior Benedick. No one’s listening to you. 
###BENEDICK
Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain! Aren’t you dead yet? 
###BEATRICE
How could disdain die when you’re here? When you’re around, even Lady Courtesy becomes Lady Disdain. 
###BENEDICK
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor. All ladies love me, except you. It’s too bad I’m so hard-hearted, because I really don’t love anyone. 
###BEATRICE
Women are lucky, then. You would make a nasty suitor. Thankfully, I feel the same way you do. I have no need for romance. I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me. 
###BENEDICK
Well, I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up. 
###BEATRICE
If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse. 
###BENEDICK
Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would. 
###BEATRICE
I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you. 
###BENEDICK
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless. That’s it—I’m done. 
###BEATRICE
You always slip out of the argument like this. I know you from before. 
## LEONATO and DON PEDRO come forward
###DON PEDRO
And that’s everything, Leonato.—Claudio, Benedick—my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina. I told him we’ll stay for at least a month, and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer. I think he’s actually serious, and not just being polite. 
###LEONATO
I am being serious, my lord. (to DON JOHN) I welcome you here as well. Now that you and your brother have made friends again, I owe you the same allegiance I owe Don Pedro. 
###DON JOHN
Thank you. I’m not a man who talks a lot, but I thank you. 
###LEONATO
If it pleases you, your highness, will you lead us all inside? 
###DON PEDRO
Give me your hand, Leonato. We will go in together. 
##Everyone exits except BENEDICK andCLAUDIO.
###CLAUDIO
Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter? 
###BENEDICK
I saw her, but I didn’t notice her. 
###CLAUDIO
Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady? 
###BENEDICK
Do you want my true opinion? Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women? 
###CLAUDIO
No, please, speak seriously. 
###BENEDICK
Well, it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly, too dark to be praised fairly, and too small to be praised greatly. I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything but herself, I don’t like her. 
###CLAUDIO
You think I’m kidding. Please tell me seriously what you think of her. 
###BENEDICK
Are you thinking of buying her? Is that why you’re asking? 
###CLAUDIO
Would it even be possible to buy a jewel as rare and precious as Hero? 
###BENEDICK
Yes, and you could buy a case to put it in, too. But tell me, are you speaking seriously? Or are you just teasing? If I’m going to sing along with you, I need to know what key you’re singing in. 
###CLAUDIO
I think she’s the most wonderful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on. 
###BENEDICK
I’m still young enough to see without glasses, and I don’t see what you’re talking about. If her cousin Beatrice didn’t have such a nasty temper, she’d be so much more beautiful than Hero that it would be like comparing May to December. But, hey, this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married, does it? 
###CLAUDIO
Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me. 
###BENEDICK
What’s going on these days? Isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife? She’s just going to cheat on him. Will I never see a sixty-year old bachelor again or will all men be swindled into marriage while they’re young? Go ahead, then, if you have to yoke yourself to marriage, like an ox carrying his load, and throw away your free time. Look, Don Pedro has come back for you. 
## DON PEDRO enters.
###DON PEDRO
What secrets between you have kept you from following us to Leonato’s? 
###BENEDICK
Your highness will have to force me to tell. 
###DON PEDRO
Your loyalty to me requires you to tell me what you’ve been talking about. 
###BENEDICK
Look, Claudio, I can keep secrets like a mute; I want you to know that. But I owe Don Pedro my allegiance—look, I have to tell him—(to DON PEDRO) Claudio is in love. With whom? That’s what you’re supposed to ask me next, your Grace. Look how short the answer is—with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter. 
###CLAUDIO
If you say so. 
###BENEDICK
Listen to him deny it, like that man in the old tale “Mr. Fox”: “It isn’t true and wasn’t true and God forbid it should be so.” 
###CLAUDIO
Unless my feelings change very soon, I have to admit it’s true. 
###DON PEDRO
It’s good if you love Hero, because she’s worthy of your love. 
###CLAUDIO
You’re trying to trick me, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
I swear, I’m telling you what I honestly think. 
###CLAUDIO
And I swear I spoke honestly to Benedick—I am in love with Hero. 
###BENEDICK
And I swear all up and down I spoke honestly when I said that this was a horrible idea. 
###CLAUDIO
I feel that I love her. 
###DON PEDRO
I know that she is worthy of that love. 
###BENEDICK
I, on the other hand, don’t feel how she could be loved and don’t know how she could be worthy. Even fire can’t melt that opinion out of me. You could burn me at the stake, and I’d still think this. 
###DON PEDRO
You never did believe in the power of beauty. 
###CLAUDIO
Or in the power of reason. 
###BENEDICK
I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her effort. And then she brought me up, and I thank her for that, too. But all the other women will have to forgive me for not being willing to be made a fool of—cheated on by a wife. I don’t want to insult any particular woman by doubting and mistrusting her, so I’ll just avoid them all. And the conclusion of this is that I’ll live as a bachelor—and, with the money I save, dress better. 
###DON PEDRO
I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with love. 
###BENEDICK
With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never sick with love. If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers, you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes. 
###DON PEDRO
I’ll be sure to remember this fuss you’ve made, in case you ever do fall in love. That’ll be news. 
###BENEDICK
If I ever change my mind, you can use me for target practice. And whoever hits the bull’s eye gets to be a hero. 
###DON PEDRO
Well, time will tell. Even the most savage bull is eventually domesticated. 
###BENEDICK
Maybe the bull is, but if I am ever domesticated, you can take that bull’s horns and put them right on my forehead, as my wife is sure to cuckold me soon enough. You might as well hang a big sign with enormous lettering around my neck. But instead of it saying “Horse for hire,” it will say “Take a look at Benedick, the married man.” 
###CLAUDIO
If that ever happened, you’d go absolutely mad. 
###DON PEDRO
Well, if Cupid hasn’t used up all his arrows in Venice, where the courtesans are famous for making men lovesick, he’ll get you to quiver and shake. Just you wait. 
###BENEDICK
That’s about as likely as an earthquake. 
###DON PEDRO
Oh, you’ll soften as time passes. While you’re waiting for that to happen, though, hurry to Leonato’s. Give him my respects, and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal. 
###BENEDICK
I think I can handle this mission. And so I commit you— 
###CLAUDIO
“Into God’s hands. From my house, if I had a house—” 
###DON PEDRO
“The sixth of July. Sincerely, your loving friend, Benedick.” 
###BENEDICK
Oh, stop joking around. You know, sometimes you two dress up your conversation with flimsy little bits of wit that don’t hold together too well. Before you make fun of everyone else, look at yourselves in the mirror! And with that, I’m leaving. 
##He exits.
###CLAUDIO
My lord, you could really help me out now. 
###DON PEDRO
I am at your service. Just tell me what you want me to do, and however hard it is, you’ll see that I’m eager to do it. 
###CLAUDIO
Does Leonato have a son, my lord? 
###DON PEDRO
Hero is his only child, and his only heir. Do you like her, Claudio? 
###CLAUDIO
Oh, my lord, when we left Messina to fight the war, I looked at Hero with the eyes of a soldier. I liked what I saw, but my mind was so occupied with the rough, violent task ahead of me that there was no chance that like would turn intolove. But now that I’m back, the room in my head that I used to fill with war plans has become crowded with soft and delicate feelings. They all lead me to the same thought—how beautiful young Hero is and how I must have liked her even before I left to fight. 
###DON PEDRO
You will become a true lover soon, and exhaust your friends with your endless chatter about your feelings. Look, if you really love the beautiful Hero, enjoy it. I will speak to her and her father about the matter, and I’ll convince Leonato to promise Hero to you. Isn’t that the reason you told me all this? 
###CLAUDIO
You can see that I’m sick with love, and you’re taking care of me in just the right way! But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions. I was going to explain my feelings with a longer story. 
###DON PEDRO
Why speak longer than you have to? That’s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses. Whatever gets the job done is best. You love Hero; that’s all I need to know to want to find a remedy. They’re going to have a costume party with dancing tonight. I’ll disguise myself as you and pour out “my” feelings to Hero, taking her prisoner with the force of my love story. Then I’ll talk to her father. And in the end, she’s yours! Let’s get started right away. 
##They exit.
## LEONATO and ANTONIO enter.
###LEONATO
Hey, brother. Tell me, where is my nephew, your son? Has he taken care of the music? 
###ANTONIO
He is taking care of it as we speak. But brother, I have some strange news for you. 
###LEONATO
Is it good news? 
###ANTONIO
Well, it seems like good news. A servant of mine overheard the Prince and Claudio talking as they walked through my orchard. The Prince said that he is in love with Hero, your daughter, and that he is going to tell her so at the dance tonight. If he she wants to marry him, too, he’s going to find you and ask for her hand immediately. 
###LEONATO
Is this servant of yours a smart man? 
###ANTONIO
He’s very bright. I’ll get him to come here, and you can ask him yourself. 
###LEONATO
No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had. But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case. Go to her and tell her for me. 
## ANTONIO ’s son enters with a musician and attendants.
Cousins, you all have work to do.—Oh, I beg your pardon. Come with me now, and help me out. —Dear cousin, please be careful during this busy time. 
##They all exit.
## DON JOHN and CONRAD enter.
###CONRAD
Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad? 
###DON JOHN
The things that cause my sadness are without limit. Therefore my sadness is without limit. 
###CONRAD
You should listen to reason. Then you’d stop being so gloomy. 
###DON JOHN
And after I have sat and listened to reason, what’s my prize? 
###CONRAD
If not an end to your suffering, then at least you’ll have the means to endure it patiently. 
###DON JOHN
I’m amazed that you—being such a moody man yourself—are moralizing about my deadly condition. I can’t hide what I am. I’ll be sad when I have reason to be sad and won’t smile at anybody’s jokes. I’ll eat when I’m hungry and won’t wait until it’s convenient. I’ll sleep when I’m tired and won’t rouse myself for anything. I’ll laugh when I’m happy and won’t flatter and fawn over anyone. 
###CONRAD
Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it. Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you. You need to act carefully if you’re going to stay in his good graces. You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose. 
###DON JOHN
I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden. It suits me more to be hated by everyone than to put on a fancy show and trick people into loving me. Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain. My brother trusts me now? Yeah—as much as a master trusts the dog he muzzles or the peasant he “frees” by chaining a big block around the man’s foot. If my mouth were unrestrained, I’d bite. If I were free, I’d do what I pleased. Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me. 
###CONRAD
Can’t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage? 
###DON JOHN
I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have. Who’s that? 
## BORACHIO enters.
What’s going on, Borachio? 
###BORACHIO
I just came from a great feast where Leonato is entertaining the Prince, your brother. I can give you information about an intended marriage. 
###DON JOHN
Will this give me an opportunity to make some mischief? Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage? 
###BORACHIO
Your brother’s right-hand man. 
###DON JOHN
Who? That pretty boy, Claudio? 
###BORACHIO
That’s the one. 
###DON JOHN
He’s a very fancy gentleman. And who’s the girl who has caught his eye? 
###BORACHIO
Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato. 
###DON JOHN
A lively young one! How did you learn about this? 
###BORACHIO
I was hired to perfume all the rooms in Leonato’s house. As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio entered. They were in the middle of a serious conversation. I quickly hid behind a tapestry and heard them agree that the Prince would court Hero tonight at the dance and, once he won her consent to marry, would give her to Claudio. 
###DON JOHN
Come, let’s go to the dance. This just may cheer me up. Claudio, the young upstart, was responsible for keeping me from gaining power over my brother. If there’s any way I can spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed. You’ll both help me, right? 
###CONRAD
Until the day we die, my lord. 
###DON JOHN
Let’s go to this great feast. They’ll be even happier now that my mood has lightened. It’s too bad the cook doesn’t think like me; she would have poisoned them all if she did. Should we go check out the scene? 
###BORACHIO
Lead the way, sir. 
##They all exit.
## LEONATO, ANTONIO HERO BEATRICE URSULA, and MARGARET enter.
###LEONATO
Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight? 
###ANTONIO
I didn’t see him. 
###BEATRICE
That man always looks so sour! Just looking at him gives me heartburn. 
###HERO
He has a very gloomy attitude. 
###BEATRICE
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick. One of them is too much like a painting of a man—he never speaks—and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy, always chattering. 
###LEONATO
So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— 
###BEATRICE
And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will. 
###LEONATO
Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people. 
###ANTONIO
Honestly, she is too ill-tempered. 
###BEATRICE
Being “too ill-tempered” is different from being simply “ill-tempered,” right? So I suppose that means I can escape God’s punishment, for in the old proverb, it is said that “God gives an ill-tempered cow short horns” so that she can’t inflict damage on anyone. But it doesn’t say anything about a cow that is too ill-tempered. 
###LEONATO
So then, for being too argumentative, God won’t send you any horns? 
###BEATRICE
Exactly. I pray every morning and night that the Lord won’t send me a husband. Really, I couldn’t stand a husband with a beard. I’d rather be wrapped in scratchy blankets all night. 
###LEONATO
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard. 
###BEATRICE
And then what would I do with him? Dress him up in my clothes and pretend he’s my lady servant? If he has a beard, he’s more than a boy; if he doesn’t have a beard, he’s less than a man. If he’s more than a boy, he’s not the one for me, and if he’s less than a man, I’m not the one for him. They say that women who die unmarried are destined to lead the apes to hell, and I suppose that’ll be my fate as well. 
###LEONATO
So you’ll go to hell? 
###BEATRICE
No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice. Hell is no place for you virgins.” So I’ll fly up to heaven (leaving the apes behind) where I’ll be met by Saint Peter guarding heaven’s gates. He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit, and I’ll have fun there forever. 
###ANTONIO
(to HERO) Well, niece, I trust that you will defer to your father on these important decisions. 
###BEATRICE
Surely, my cousin has a duty to please her father. But if the husband her father chooses isn’t handsome, she should sweetly tell her father that she will please herself—with another one. 
###LEONATO
Well, niece, I hope that I will see you married one day. 
###BEATRICE
No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt. What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust? Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay? No, uncle, I won’t be married. And anyhow, if Adam is the father of all mankind, then his sons are my brothers, and really I believe that incest is a sin. 
###LEONATO
(to HERO) Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince asks for your hand in marriage, you know what to tell him. 
###BEATRICE
But cousin, make sure he woos you properly and appropriately. If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing. Look, the three stages of romance are like three different dances. The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion. The wedding is a like a dance you would do before the King: proper and decorous. Finally, you get to the part where you regret having gotten married in the first place. It is like the lively cinquepace: it goes faster and faster until you eventually topple over and die. 
###LEONATO
Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive. 
###BEATRICE
I have a good eye, uncle. I can see what’s in broad daylight. 
###LEONATO
The partygoers have arrived. Let’s give them room. 
## DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO,BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO,MARGARET, URSULA enter along with other partygoers. They’re all wearing masks.
###DON PEDRO
My lady, will you have a dance with me? 
##They begin to dance.
###HERO
As long as you move gracefully, look handsome, and say nothing, I’m yours for the dance. And I’ll even linger after I’ve gone. 
###DON PEDRO
Will I be with you then? 
###HERO
Perhaps, if I decide to let you. 
###DON PEDRO
And when will that be? 
###HERO
When I like the way you look, for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask! 
###DON PEDRO
My mask is like the roof of the poor Philemon’s humble cottage; underneath the mask, I am as magnificent as the glorious god Jove. 
###HERO
Well, then, since Philemon’s roof was thatched with straw, your mask should have a beard. 
###DON PEDRO
If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly. 
##They move aside. BALTHASAR andMARGARET move forward.
###BALTHASAR
Well, I wish you liked me. 
###MARGARET
I’m glad I don’t, for your sake. I have many awful qualities. 
###BALTHASAR
Tell me one. 
###MARGARET
I say my prayers out loud. 
###BALTHASAR
That makes me love you even more. Everyone who hears you can shout, “Amen.” 
###MARGARET
God give me a good dance partner! 
###BALTHASAR
Amen. That would be me. 
###MARGARET
And God take him away from me when we’re finished dancing! Go ahead—say “Amen.” 
###BALTHASAR
No more talking. I’ve got my answer. 
##They move aside. URSULA andANTONIO move forward.
###URSULA
I know who you are; you are Signior Antonio. 
###ANTONIO
No, really, I’m not. 
###URSULA
I can tell by the way you waggle your head. 
###ANTONIO
Really, I’m only pretending to be him. 
###URSULA
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself. Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands. You are Antonio, you are he. 
###ANTONIO
In short, I’m not. 
###URSULA
Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit? Can a good thing hide itself? Be quiet, you are Antonio. A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that. 
##They move aside. BENEDICK andBEATRICE move forward.
###BEATRICE
Won’t you tell me who told you that? 
###BENEDICK
No, you’ll have to excuse me. 
###BEATRICE
And you won’t tell me who you are? 
###BENEDICK
Not now. 
###BEATRICE
Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?! Well, it must have been Signior Benedick. 
###BENEDICK
Who’s that? 
###BEATRICE
I’m sure you know him. 
###BENEDICK
No I don’t, believe me. 
###BEATRICE
What, he never made you laugh? 
###BENEDICK
Please tell me, who is this man? 
###BEATRICE
Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that. His only talent is his capacity to come up with unbelievable slanders. Only the most immoral people enjoy his company, and they like him not for his wit but his outrageousness. He manages to both please and anger people; they laugh at him and then beat him up. I’m sure he’s out there dancing. I could have sworn he trampled on me. 
###BENEDICK
When I meet this gentleman, I’ll tell him what you’ve said. 
###BEATRICE
Oh, please do. He’ll say a few nasty things about me, and if nobody listens to him or laughs, he’ll be thrown into a funk. And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten, because he’ll be too miserable for dinner. 
##Music for the dance begins.
Come on, we have to follow the leaders of the dance. 
###BENEDICK
In every good thing they do. 
###BEATRICE
No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song. 
##There is a dance. Everyone exits except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, andCLAUDIO.
###DON JOHN
(to BORACHIO) My brother just wooed Hero and now has taken her father inside to tell him his feelings. The ladies have followed Hero, but one masked man remains. 
###BORACHIO
That’s Claudio. I can tell by the way he carries himself. 
###DON JOHN
(to CLAUDIO) Aren’t you Signior Benedick? 
###CLAUDIO
You know me too well. I am Benedick. 
###DON JOHN
Sir, my brother is very fond of you. He is in love with Hero. Please make him change his mind. She doesn’t have the proper rank to marry the Prince. You would be doing a good service. 
###CLAUDIO
How do you know he loves her? 
###DON JOHN
I heard him swear he did. 
###BORACHIO
I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight. 
###DON JOHN
Come on, let’s get to the banquet. 
## DON JOHN andBORACHIO exit.
###CLAUDIO
(taking off his mask) Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears. Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself. Friendship is enduring except when love is involved. Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves. They should look for themselves, without asking someone else to get involved in their affairs. Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion. This happens a lot, but it didn’t occur to me that it would happen to me. Goodbye then, Hero. 
## BENEDICK enters.
###BENEDICK
Claudio? 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, that’s me. 
###BENEDICK
Will you come with me? 
###CLAUDIO
Where? 
###BENEDICK
Right over to that willow tree to see about your business. How do you want to wear your garland of willow leaves? Around your neck, like a moneylender’s gold chain, or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s sash? You have to wear it somehow, because the Prince has gotten your Hero. 
###CLAUDIO
I hope he enjoys her. 
###BENEDICK
You sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls. But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way? 
###CLAUDIO
Please, leave me alone. 
###BENEDICK
Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man. A boy robbed you, but you’ll beat up the post instead. 
###CLAUDIO
If you won’t leave, then I’ll leave. 
##He exits.
###BENEDICK
Oh, the poor bird. Now he’ll hide himself in the bushes. But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time. “The Prince’s fool”! Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful. Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way. I don’t have that kind of reputation! Beatrice’s mean, sarcastic nature makes her believe that the entire world shares her opinions; that’s why she describes me this way. Well, I’ll get my revenge. 
## DON PEDRO enters.
###DON PEDRO
Now, sir, where is Claudio? Did you see him? 
###BENEDICK
Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news. I found him here, as sad as a rabbit in a burrow. I told him—and I think I was telling the truth—that you had won the lady’s heart. I offered to accompany him to the willow tree, where he could either make a garland—fit to be worn by an abandoned lover—or gather sticks into a bundle, ready for his beating. 
###DON PEDRO
Beating? Why, what did he do? 
###BENEDICK
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him. 
###DON PEDRO
What, is trusting a friend such a crime? The criminal is the one who stole the nest. 
###BENEDICK
It might have been appropriate to make both the rod and the garland. He could have worn the garland himself and beaten you with the rod, since you—as I understand it—have stolen his bird’s nest. 
###DON PEDRO
I only want to teach the baby birds to sing; then I will return the nest to its rightful owner. 
###BENEDICK
We’ll wait and see; if the chicks follow your lead—if Hero is ready to love Claudio—then we’ll know you’re telling the truth. 
###DON PEDRO
Lady Beatrice is angry with you. The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her. 
###BENEDICK
Not even a block of wood could handle her abuses! An oak tree barely clinging to life would have revived itself to fight her. Even my mask seemed to come to life in order to argue with her. She told me—not realizing it was me—that I was the Prince’s jester and as dull as mud. She hurled mocking insults at me with such incredible speed that all I could do was stand there, paralyzed. She speaks daggers, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star. I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise. If she were married to the great hero Hercules, she would have humiliated him with chores around the house and ordered him to chop up his famous club for firewood. Please, don’t mention her. She’s as wicked as Ate, just disguised in pretty clothes. I wish to God that some wise man would conjure her away, because as long as she lives on earth, our lives are filled with turmoil. It’s quieter in hell, where people, sinning on purpose, are eager to be sent just to get away from her. So chaos, horror, and sorrow follow her wherever she goes. 
## CLAUDIO, BEATRICE,HERO, and LEONATO enter.
###DON PEDRO
Look, here she comes. 
###BENEDICK
Your highness, could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth? I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of. I’ll fetch you a toothpick from the farthest reaches of Asia, or find out Prester John’s shoe size, or snatch a hair from Kublai Khan’s beard, or deliver any message you wish to relay to the Pygmies—anything rather than exchange three words with this awful, screeching woman. Isn’t there something you want from me? 
###DON PEDRO
Nothing but your good company. 
###BENEDICK
Oh, God, sir, here comes a dish I hate. I can’t stand tongue. 
##He exits.
###DON PEDRO
(to BEATRICE) Lady, you have lost Signior Benedick’s heart. 
###BEATRICE
It’s true, my lord. He lent it to me once, and I paid him back with interest: a double heart for his single one. Really, he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice. So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it. 
###DON PEDRO
You’ve humiliated him, lady: you’ve put him down. 
###BEATRICE
And I hope that he won’t put me down or I’m sure to have fools for children.I’ve brought Claudio, who you sent me to find. 
###DON PEDRO
Why, what’s wrong, count? Why are you so sad? 
###CLAUDIO
I’m not sad, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
What then, sick? 
###CLAUDIO
I’m neither, my lord. 
###BEATRICE
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well—he’s just civil, as Seville as an orange, with the same jealous-yellow complexion. 
###DON PEDRO
Truly, lady, I think your description is correct, though I swear he has no reason to look like that. Here, Claudio, I’ve wooed Hero for you, and she’s agreed to marry you. I’ve told her father, and he’s given his permission. Tell us when you wish to get married, and may God give you joy. 
###LEONATO
Claudio, take my daughter, and, with her, take my fortunes. The Prince has made the match, and may God bless it. 
###BEATRICE
Speak, Claudio, that’s your cue. 
###CLAUDIO
Complete joy makes one speechless; if I were only a little happy, then I could say exactly how much. Lady, you are mine and I am yours. For you, I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange. 
###BEATRICE
Say something, cousin. Or, if you can’t say anything, stop his mouth with a kiss and don’t let him speak, either. 
###DON PEDRO
Truly, lady, you have a merry heart. 
###BEATRICE
Yes, my lord. I thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness. Look, my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him. 
###CLAUDIO
Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin. 
###BEATRICE
Thank the lord for alliances! So everyone goes off into the world except me, who stays in because I’m sunburned. I should sit in the corner and sing that song, “Heigh-Ho for a Husband!” 
###DON PEDRO
Lady Beatrice, I’ll get you a husband. 
###BEATRICE
I’d rather get a husband from your father. Don’t you have any brothers like you? Your father’s sons would make excellent husbands, if only a girl could catch one for herself. 
###DON PEDRO
Will you take me, my lady? 
###BEATRICE
No, my lord, unless I could have another husband for the work week. You are too expensive to wear every day. But please, forgive me, your highness. I was born to speak cleverly, not seriously. 
###DON PEDRO
I’d be more offended if you were silent, for being lively and cheerful suits you best. Surely, you must have been born at a happy time. 
###BEATRICE
Actually, my lord, my mother cried when she was giving birth to me. But then a star danced in the sky, and that’s the moment I was born.—Kinsmen, I’m off. 
###LEONATO
Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned? 
###BEATRICE
Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If you’ll excuse me, your grace. 
##She exits.
###DON PEDRO
I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady. 
###LEONATO
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord. She’s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then. Hero told me that Beatrice has often had dreams about being unhappy, and managed to wake herself from them by laughing. 
###DON PEDRO
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband. 
###LEONATO
No, not at all. She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit. 
###DON PEDRO
She would make a good wife for Benedick. 
###LEONATO
Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week. 
###DON PEDRO
Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be married? 
###CLAUDIO
Tomorrow, my lord. Time will move as slowly as an old man until our love receives its proper ceremony. 
###LEONATO
Wait till Monday, my dear son, which is only a week away. Even that is too short a time to plan things the way I would like. 
###DON PEDRO
(to CLAUDIO) Oh, don’t look so frustrated at having to wait so long. I promise you, Claudio, the time will go by quickly. While we’re waiting for the wedding, I’m going to take on an impossible task: to make Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice fall in love with each other. I aim to see them matched, and with all of your help, I’m sure we can make it happen. 
###LEONATO
My lord, I will help you, even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight. 
###CLAUDIO
Me too, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
And you, sweet Hero? 
###HERO
I’ll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin get a good husband. 
###DON PEDRO
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of. This much I can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in battle, and has established his good character. Hero, I’ll show you how to influence your cousin so she falls in love with Benedick. We men will trick Benedick so that, despite his quick wit and his queasiness about marriage, he will fall in love with her. If we can do this, then we will steal Cupid’s glory. We will be the supreme love gods! Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan. 
##They all exit.
##Enter DON JOHN andBORACHIO 
###DON JOHN
It’s arranged. The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter. 
###BORACHIO
Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it. 
###DON JOHN
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be like medicine to me. I hate him so much it makes me sick, and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy. How will you wreck this marriage? 
###BORACHIO
I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me. 
###DON JOHN
Quickly, tell me how. 
###BORACHIO
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret, Hero’s servant woman, likes me. 
###DON JOHN
I remember. 
###BORACHIO
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she looks out Hero’s bedroom window. 
###DON JOHN
How will that kill this marriage? 
###BORACHIO
That part is up to you. Go to the Prince, your brother, and tell him that he has done a terrible thing by matching the renowned Claudio—whom you greatly admire—with such a tainted whore as Hero. 
###DON JOHN
What will be my evidence? 
###BORACHIO
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince, anger Claudio, ruin Hero, and kill Leonato. Is there anything else you wish? 
###DON JOHN
That’s all I want, and I’ll do anything to accomplish it. 
###BORACHIO
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone. Tell them you know that Hero loves me. Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin. Of course, they won’t believe you without proof. Tell them you’ve seen the two of us at Hero’s bedroom window, and then bring them to see for themselves on the night before the wedding. I’ll arrange it so that Hero is away for the night, so what they’ll actually see is Margaret and me at the window, calling each other “Hero” and “Claudio.” It’ll be such blatant evidence of Hero’s disloyalty that Claudio’s jealousy will quickly turn to certainty, and the wedding will be instantly called off. 
###DON JOHN
Make the arrangements, and I’ll do it. Do this carefully, and I will reward you with a thousand gold coins. 
###BORACHIO
If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning won’t fail me. 
###DON JOHN
I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding. 
##They exit.
## BENEDICK enters.
###BENEDICK
Boy! 
##A BOY enters.
###BOY
Yes Signior? 
###BENEDICK
In my bedroom window there is a book. Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard. 
###BOY
I’m already here, sir. 
###BENEDICK
I see that you are here, but I’d like you to go there and then come back again. 
##The BOY exits.
I’m amazed that a man, after watching romance turn another man into a fool and laughing at that man, can turn right around and become the thing he’s scorned. That’s the kind of man Claudio is. I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe. I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket. He used to speak plainly and to the point, like an honorable man and soldier; now his speech is elaborate and flowery. His words are like a miraculous banquet, full of strange new dishes. Will I be changed like that, and see the world through a lover’s eyes? I’m not sure, but I don’t think so. 
I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool. A beautiful woman comes along, but I’m unmoved. A wise woman turns up, but I’m unmoved. A virtuous woman appears, but I’m unmoved. I refuse to fall in love until all three qualities unite in a single woman. She must be rich, certainly, and smart, or I’ll have nothing to do with her. She has to be virtuous, or I’ll never bid on her; beautiful, or I won’t bother to look at her. Mild-mannered, or else she should stay away from me. Noble, or I won’t have her even if she’s an angel. She must be well spoken, an excellent musician, and her hair should be—well, I suppose the color doesn’t matter. Ha! Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love. I’ll hide in the arbor. 
##He hides.
## DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO enter. BALTHASAR enters with music.
###DON PEDRO
Well, should we hear some music? 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, my lord. Listen to how quiet the evening is, as if it’s purposefully setting the stage for a song. 
###DON PEDRO
(speaking so that only CLAUDIOcan hear) Do you see where Benedick is hiding? 
###CLAUDIO
(speaking so that only DON PEDROcan hear) Yes, very well, my lord. Once the music has ended, we’ll give him more than he bargained for. 
###DON PEDRO
Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again. 
###BALTHASAR
Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing. 
###DON PEDRO
You can tell an artist is excellent when he denies his own perfection. Please, sing for us; don’t make me woo you anymore! 
###BALTHASAR
Since you put it that way, I’ll sing. You’re like a suitor who courts a woman insincerely, swearing that he loves her even though he really doesn’t find her worthy. 
###DON PEDRO
Come on, please sing. If you’d like to continue this discussion, at least do so with music. 
###BALTHASAR
Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note. 
###DON PEDRO
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes! Get on with your note-playing now. 
##Music plays.
###BENEDICK
(to himself) That music must be divine, because their souls have been captivated. Isn’t it strange that strings made of sheep’s guts are capable of drawing men’s souls out of their bodies? Well, I’d rather listen to a plain old hunting horn than this music, when all is said and done. 
###BALTHASAR
(singing)  Don’t cry anymore, ladies, don’t cry anymore  Men have always been deceivers,  One foot on a ship and one on the shore,  Never devoted to anything.  So don’t cry like that, just let them go  And be happy and carefree forever,  Turning all your sad sounds around  When you sing “Hey, nonny nonny” instead.  Don’t sing more sad songs  About being down in the dumps  For men have been committing this kind of fraud  Ever since the first summer trees had leaves.  So don’t cry like that, just let them go  And be happy and carefree forever,  Turning all your sad sounds around  When you sing “Hey, nonny nonny” instead. 
###DON PEDRO
That’s a good song. 
###BALTHASAR
And a bad singer, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
Ha! No, no, really, your voice is good enough in a pinch. 
###BENEDICK
(to himself) If a dog had howled like that, I would have hung it. I hope his horrible singing doesn’t have any ill effects. I would’ve rather listened to the night raven screech, even if the bird’s noise does give me the plague, as they say it will. 
###DON PEDRO
Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar? Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window. 
###BALTHASAR
I’ll do the best I can, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
Please do. Goodbye. 
## BALTHASAR exits.
Come here, Leonato. What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick? 
###CLAUDIO
Oh yes. (speaking so that only DON PEDRO can hear) Go on, keep walking: our prey is in sight.—I never thought that woman would love any man. 
###LEONATO
I didn’t, either. But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to hate. 
###BENEDICK
(to himself) Is it possible? Is that the way the wind is blowing? 
###LEONATO
Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding. 
###DON PEDRO
Maybe she’s just pretending. 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, that’s quite likely. 
###LEONATO
Oh God! Pretending? No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then. 
###DON PEDRO
Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit? 
###CLAUDIO
(speaking so that only LEONATOcan hear) Bait the hook well; this fish is going to bite. 
###LEONATO
What symptoms, my lord? She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how. 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, she did tell us. 
###DON PEDRO
Please, please tell me! This is amazing. I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love. 
###LEONATO
I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick. 
###BENEDICK
(to himself) I would take this as a joke if the old man weren’t saying it. Mischief surely can’t be hiding in such a respectable man. 
###CLAUDIO
(speaking so that only DON PEDROcan hear) We’ve infected him! Keep it up. 
###DON PEDRO
Has she told Benedick how she feels? 
###LEONATO
No, and she swears she never will. That’s what’s driving her crazy. 
###CLAUDIO
It’s true, Hero says so. Beatrice asks, “Does it make any sense to write and tell him I love him when I have always treated him with scorn?” 
###LEONATO
She says this as she begins to write the letter. She’ll be getting up twenty times in a night, sitting there in her slip until she’s written a page. My daughter told me everything. 
###CLAUDIO
Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of Hero’s. 
###LEONATO
Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it? 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, that’s the one. 
###LEONATO
Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her. “I compare him,” she says, “to myself, and I know that I would mock him if he wrote me such a letter. Yes, even though I love him, I would mock him.” 
###CLAUDIO
Then she falls down to her knees, weeps, sobs, beats her breast, tears her hair, prays, and curses: “Oh sweet Benedick! God give me patience!” 
###LEONATO
She did indeed, my daughter says so. She worries that Beatrice is so overwrought that she might do herself harm someday. It’s true. 
###DON PEDRO
If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should. 
###CLAUDIO
And what would that accomplish? He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more. 
###DON PEDRO
If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him. She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous. 
###CLAUDIO
And she is very smart. 
###DON PEDRO
Except for the fact that she loves Benedick. 
###LEONATO
Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body, it’s ten to one that the passion will win. I am sorry for her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her guardian. 
###DON PEDRO
I wish she were in love with me instead. I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife. Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say. 
###LEONATO
Is that a good idea, do you think? 
###CLAUDIO
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults. 
###DON PEDRO
She’s probably right. If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous. 
###CLAUDIO
He’s a very proper man. 
###DON PEDRO
Indeed, he is good-looking and carries himself well. 
###CLAUDIO
And I swear to God he’s very smart. 
###DON PEDRO
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit. 
###CLAUDIO
And I believe him to be brave. 
###DON PEDRO
As brave as Hector, surely. And you could say that he is wise in managing fights, for he either avoids them discreetly or enters into them timidly. 
###LEONATO
If he fears God, he must necessarily keep the peace. If he breaks the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling. 
###DON PEDRO
And he’ll do that, because he’s a God-fearing man, even though his joking makes it seem otherwise. Well, I’m sorry for your niece. Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice’s love? 
###CLAUDIO
No, don’t ever tell him, my lord. Let her get over it, with the help of good advice. 
###LEONATO
No, that’s impossible. Her heart will break first. 
###DON PEDRO
Well, we’ll hear more about it from your daughter. Let it sit for a while. I am very fond of Benedick, and I just wish he would take a look at himself and realize how unfairly he’s treating this good woman. 
###LEONATO
My lord, will you come with me? Dinner is ready. 
###CLAUDIO
(speaking so that only DON PEDROand LEONATO can hear) If he doesn’t fall in love with her now, I’ll never trust my intuition again. 
###DON PEDRO
(speaking so that only LEONATOcan hear) The same trap must be set for her; that’s your daughter’s and servants' job. The real fun will be when they both believe the other to be in love, without any of it being true. I can’t wait to watch that drama—it’ll be a pantomime, since both of them will be totally speechless! Let’s send Beatrice to call Benedick in to dinner 
##Everyone except BENEDICK exits.
###BENEDICK
(coming forward) This can’t be a trick. They spoke with great seriousness, and they have Hero’s testimony. They seem to pity the lady. It seems her love is stretched to the limit. She loves me? Well, that love must be returned! I hear how I’m criticized. They say I’ll be smug if I find out she loves me. They also say she’d rather die than give any sign of her feelings. I never thought I’d marry. I can’t appear to be proud. People who discover their faults and can then change them are lucky indeed. They say the lady is beautiful; it’s true, I’ve seen it myself. And virtuous; that’s true, I can’t disprove that. And smart, except that she loves me. That may not be any proof of her intelligence, but I swear it won’t be evidence of her stupidity—for I’m going to be horribly in love with her! People might tease me here and there, since I attacked marriage for so long. But don’t tastes change? A man can love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old. Will quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from getting what his heart desires? No! The world needs to be populated. When I said that I’d die as a bachelor, I just meant that I didn’t think I’d live until I got married. Here comes Beatrice. By God! She’s a beautiful lady. I think I sense some signs of love in her. 
## BEATRICE enters.
###BEATRICE
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner. 
###BENEDICK
Lovely Beatrice, I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that. 
###BEATRICE
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me. If the job had been painful, I would not have come. 
###BENEDICK
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message? 
###BEATRICE
Yes, as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint. You don’t want to eat, sir? Goodbye, then. 
##She exits.
###BENEDICK
Ha! “Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that. “I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.” That’s like saying, “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you.’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her, I’m a horrible person. If I don’t love her, I’m completely hard-hearted. I will go get her picture. 
##He exits.
## HERO, MARGARET, andURSULA enter.
###HERO
Margaret, run into the sitting room. You’ll find Beatrice there, talking to Claudio and the Prince. Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her. Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun. (The same honeysuckles that were once ripened in the sun; they’re like courtiers who rise because the king favors them, then plot to overthrow his Majesty.) She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation. This is your job. Do it well, and then leave us. 
###MARGARET
I’ll make her come right away, I promise you. 
##She exits.
###HERO
All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick. Whenever I mention him, praise him more than any man deserves. It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice. We’ll make our arrows the same way Cupid does: with gossip and rumor. 
## BEATRICE enters, behind.
Let’s start. See, Beatrice has run over like a little bird, keeping close to the ground and trying to overhear us. 
###URSULA
(speaking so that only HERO can hear) The best part of fishing is watching the fish cut through the water and greedily take the bait. Now we’re fishing for Beatrice, who’s hiding right now in the honeysuckle arbor. Don’t worry, I’ll do my part. 
###HERO
(speaking so that only URSULAcan hear) Then let’s get closer, so she can hear all the false, sweet bait we’re setting for her.— (approaching the bower) No, truly, Ursula, she’s too scornful. She’s as devious and fierce as the wild hawks on the rocks. 
###URSULA
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much? 
###HERO
That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say. 
###URSULA
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this, madam? 
###HERO
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark. 
###URSULA
Why did you do that? Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice? 
###HERO
By the god of love, I know that he deserves all that a man might possess. But Nature never made a woman’s heart as proud and tough as Beatrice’s. There is scorn and disdain in her eyes, and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon. She values her wit more highly than anything else, which looks weak by comparison. She’s so in love with herself, she’s incapable of loving anyone else. She can’t even imagine what “love” is. 
###URSULA
Yes, you’re right. It would be bad if she knew about Benedick’s love and teased him about it. 
###HERO
It’s true. Whenever she meets a man—no matter how wise, noble, young, handsome—she rearranges all his good qualities so they end up looking bad. If he has a fair complexion, she’ll say the pretty man should be her sister, not her husband. If he’s dark-skinned, Nature must have spilled some ink while drawing his foolish face. If he’s tall, she’ll say he’s a spear topped by an odd head; if he’s short, she says he looks like a badly carved miniature. If he’s talkative, he’s a weathervane, moving in all directions at once; if he’s silent, he’s a block that can’t be moved at all. And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has. 
###URSULA
It’s true, her nitpicking is hardly admirable. 
###HERO
No, it certainly is not admirable to be so perverse and eccentric. But who would dare tell her? If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air. She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit. 
So Benedick should conceal his emotions. Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away. It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling. 
###URSULA
But you should tell her about this, and hear what she has to say. 
###HERO
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions. I’ll make up some awful things about my cousin and ruin her reputation. You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word. 
###URSULA
Oh, don’t injure your cousin like that! With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick. 
###HERO
He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio. 
###URSULA
Don’t be angry with me for speaking my mind, but throughout Italy, Benedick is considered the best man in looks, bearing, intelligence, and bravery. 
###HERO
True, he has an excellent reputation. 
###URSULA
And he deserves it, having been excellent before he had a reputation for it. When are you getting married, madam? 
###HERO
Tomorrow, and then every day after that. Come on, let’s go inside. I want to show you some clothing, so you can tell me what I should wear tomorrow. 
##They move away from the bower.
###URSULA
(speaking so that only HERO can hear) We caught her in our trap, madam, I’m sure of it. 
###HERO
(speaking so that only URSULAcan hear) If so, then you never know where love will come from. Cupid gets some lovers with arrows, but some he lays traps for! 
##Everyone but BEATRICE exits.
###BEATRICE
(coming forward) I’m burning up with shame! Can this be true? Do people criticize me this much for being proud and scornful? Then I’ll say goodbye to my contempt and my pride in being unmarried! No good is spoken of such a person as me behind her back. Benedick, keep on loving me and I will return your love, like a wild hawk being tamed by her handler. I’ll be kind to you from now on, and if you really do love me, that kindness will encourage you to seal our love with a wedding band. People say that you deserve my love, and I believe it—not just because they’ve said so. 
##She exits.
## DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO,BENEDICK, and LEONATO enter.
###DON PEDRO
I’ll stay in Messina until you’re married, and then I’ll go to Aragon. 
###CLAUDIO
I’ll go with you, my lord, if you’ll allow me. 
###DON PEDRO
No, taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it. I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me, for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker. He’s evaded love once or twice, and since then Cupid doesn’t dare to shoot at him. Benedick’s heart is like a bell, with his tongue as the clapper: everything his heart thinks, his tongue speaks. 
###BENEDICK
Gentleman, I am not the same man I was before. 
###LEONATO
I agree. I think you seem more serious. 
###CLAUDIO
I hope he’s in love. 
###DON PEDRO
Come off it, man! There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love. If he looks serious, he must need money. 
###BENEDICK
I have a toothache. 
###DON PEDRO
Draw it. 
###BENEDICK
Hang it! 
###CLAUDIO
You have to hang it first. Then you can draw it. 
###DON PEDRO
What, are you moaning on about your toothache? 
###LEONATO
It could only have been caused by some humor or worm. 
###BENEDICK
Well, everyone knows how to overcome an injury except the one who actually has one. 
###CLAUDIO
I repeat, he’s in love. 
###DON PEDRO
No, there’s no love in him, unless you mean his love for strange costumes. He’s a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, and sometimes wears the clothing of two countries at once: a German from the waist down, with his baggy pants, and a Spaniard from the hips up, with a cloak and no jacket. Unless you’re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness—which, judging from his appearance, he has—he is no fool for love, as you pretend. 
###CLAUDIO
If he’s not in love with a woman, then you can’t trust the usual symptoms. He brushes his hat in the mornings. What do you think that means? 
###DON PEDRO
Has any man seen him at the barber’s? 
###CLAUDIO
No, but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him. The beard that used to decorate Benedick’s cheeks has been shaved off and is now stuffing tennis balls. 
###LEONATO
Getting rid of the beard definitely makes him look younger. 
###DON PEDRO
And he’s rubbed himself with perfume. Can you smell out his secret now? 
###CLAUDIO
That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love. 
###DON PEDRO
The biggest clue is his seriousness. 
###CLAUDIO
And when has he ever been known to wash his face? 
###DON PEDRO
Yes, or to wear cosmetics? I hear what they say about him for doing that. 
###CLAUDIO
Indeed, his mocking spirit has now crawled into a lute, and he can be played like an instrument— 
###DON PEDRO
Truly, it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick. A conclusion, a conclusion: he is in love. 
###CLAUDIO
Oh, and I know who loves him. 
###DON PEDRO
I bet I know, too: someone who clearly doesn’t know him at all. 
###CLAUDIO
No, she does know him, and she also knows all his bad qualities—and in spite of all this, she still dies for him. 
###DON PEDRO
She’ll be buried with her face upwards, then. 
###BENEDICK
This chatter is no cure for my toothache. (to LEONATO) Old sir, please walk with me a bit. I have eight or nine well-considered words to say to you, and I don’t want these fools to hear. 
## BENEDICK and LEONATO exit.
###DON PEDRO
I bet my life he’s gone to speak with Leonato about Beatrice! 
###CLAUDIO
It must be. By now, Hero and Margaret have done their part with Beatrice. The two bears won’t bite each other the next time they meet. 
## DON JOHN enters.
###DON JOHN
My lord and brother, God save you. 
###DON PEDRO
Good evening, brother. 
###DON JOHN
If you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you. 
###DON PEDRO
In private? 
###DON JOHN
If you wish. But Count Claudio can stay, for what I’m about to say concerns him. 
###DON PEDRO
What’s the matter? 
###DON JOHN
(to CLAUDIO) Do you plan on getting married tomorrow? 
###DON PEDRO
You know that he does. 
###DON JOHN
I don’t know that, once he knows what I know. 
###CLAUDIO
If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married, I urge you to tell me. 
###DON JOHN
You may think that I don’t love you. I hope that, after I tell you my news, you will think better of me. My brother thinks highly of you, and because of his affection, has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy. 
###DON PEDRO
Why, what’s the matter? 
###DON JOHN
I came here to tell you—I’ll make this short, since she’s already been talked about for too long—the lady is unfaithful. 
###CLAUDIO
Who, Hero? 
###DON JOHN
That’s the one: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero. 
###CLAUDIO
Unfaithful? 
###DON JOHN
The word is too good to represent her wickedness. She is worse than wicked. If you can think of a more awful title, I’ll call her that. But don’t keep wondering without more proof. Come with me tonight, and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber—even tonight, the night before her wedding. If you still love her after that, then marry her tomorrow. But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind. 
###CLAUDIO
(to DON PEDRO) Is this possible? 
###DON PEDRO
I won’t consider it. 
###DON JOHN
If you won’t risk coming to see her tonight, then don’t claim to know what she’s like. If you follow me, I’ll give you all the proof you need. Once you have seen more and heard more, then you can decide what to do. 
###CLAUDIO
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her. 
###DON PEDRO
And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her. 
###DON JOHN
I won’t say anything else about her until you two see things for yourselves. Remain calm until midnight, and then you’ll see what the trouble is. 
###DON PEDRO
Oh, this day has turned into a disaster! 
###CLAUDIO
Oh, mischief has ruined our plans! 
###DON JOHN
Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God! That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two. 
##They all exit.
## DOGBERRYDogberry and Verges, comically addled characters, continually say the opposite of what they mean.DOGBERRY and VERGES with several of the Prince’sWATCHMENWatchmen are officers patrolling the city at night.WATCHMEN enter.
###DOGBERRY
Are you all good and honest men? 
###VERGES
Yes they are, otherwise it would be proper for them to suffer salvation, body and soul. 
###DOGBERRY
If they had any allegiance when they were chosen for the Prince’s watch, a punishment like that would be too good for them. 
###VERGES
Well, give them their assignment, Sir Dogberry. 
###DOGBERRY
First, which man do you think is most desertless to be leader of the watch? 
###FIRST WATCHMAN
Either Hugh Otecake, sir, or else George Seacole, because both of them can read and write. 
###DOGBERRY
Come here, Sir Seacole. God has blessed you with a good name. To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift. 
###SECOND WATCHMAN
Both of which, master constable— 
###DOGBERRY
You have. I knew that would be your answer. Well, for your good looks, sir, thank God and don’t boast about it. As for your reading and writing, use those skills when you can’t use your looks. You’re thought to be the most senseless and fit man here, so you will carry the lantern and be constable. This is your assignment: 
you will comprehend any vagrant men you see. You are to order all men to stop, in the Prince’s name. 
###SECOND WATCHMAN
And what if he won’t stop? 
###DOGBERRY
Well then, don’t bother with him and let him go. Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal. 
###VERGES
If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects. 
###DOGBERRY
True, and you aren’t supposed to meddle with anyone but the Prince’s subjects. You will also stay quiet in the streets, for a babbling watch is most tolerable and will not be endured. 
###WATCHMAN
We’ll sleep instead of talk. We know what’s appropriate for a watch. 
###DOGBERRY
Why, you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman. Sleeping on the watch shouldn’t be a problem; just make sure that your weapons don’t get stolen. Also, you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed. 
###WATCHMAN
And what if they won’t go? 
###DOGBERRY
Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober. If even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction, you can say that they’re not the men you thought they were. 
###WATCHMAN
Very good, sir. 
###DOGBERRY
If you meet a thief, you can expect him to be dishonest. The less you have to do with that kind of man, the more honest you will be. 
###WATCHMAN
So if we know that a man is a thief, should we try to arrest him? 
###DOGBERRY
Your position permits you to, but I think that those who stick their hands in pitch get their hands dirty. If you encounter a thief, I think the most peaceable thing to do is to let him be himself—and steal away. 
###VERGES
You have always been known as a merciful man, partner. 
###DOGBERRY
Truly, I wouldn’t even hang a dog, much more a man who has any honesty in him. 
###VERGES
(to the watchmen) If you hear a child crying in the night, you should call the nurse and tell her to quiet the child. 
###WATCHMAN
What if the nurse is asleep and doesn’t hear us? 
###DOGBERRY
Well then, leave quietly, and let the child’s crying wake up the nurse. The ewe that doesn’t go to her lamb when it baas will never tend to another animal’s child. 
###VERGES
That’s very true. 
###DOGBERRY
And that’s the end of your assignment. You, constable, are representing the Prince himself. If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop. 
###VERGES
No, by our Lady, I don’t think he can. 
###DOGBERRY
I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it. Truly though, you can’t stop the Prince without the Prince’s consent, for the watch shouldn’t offend anyone, and it’s an offense to keep a man without his consent. 
###VERGES
By our Lady, I think that’s true. 
###DOGBERRY
Ha, ha, ha! Well, gentlemen, good night. And if anything important happens, find me and let me know. Keep each other’s secrets and your own. Good night. Come, friend. 
###WATCHMAN
Well gentlemen, we’ve heard our assignment. Let’s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed. 
###DOGBERRY
One more thing, good gentlemen. Watch over Signior Leonato’s house; with the wedding being held there tomorrow, there’s a great to-do there tonight. Adieu. Be vigitant, I beg you. 
## DOGBERRY and VERGES exit.
## BORACHIO and CONRADE enter.
###BORACHIO
Conrade! 
###WATCHMAN
(whispering) Quiet! Don’t move! 
###BORACHIO
Conrade, I say! 
###CONRADE
I’m here, man, at your elbow. 
###BORACHIO
Come to think of it, I thought I felt a scab there. 
###CONRADE
I’ll get you for that. Now get on with your story. 
###BORACHIO
Since it’s drizzling, stand under this overhang with me and, like a true drunk, I’ll tell you everything. 
###WATCHMAN
(speaking so that only the other WATCHMEN can hear) There’s some treason occurring, gentlemen. Stay here. 
###BORACHIO
You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John. 
###CONRADE
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable? 
###BORACHIO
You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich. Because when rich villains need poor villains' services, those poor ones can name the price. 
###CONRADE
I can’t believe it. 
###BORACHIO
That only proves how inexperienced you are. You know that the style of a man’s jacket or hat or coat means nothing. 
###CONRADE
Yes, it’s just clothing. 
###BORACHIO
No, I mean, the fashion of a man’s clothing tells us nothing about the man. 
###CONRADE
Yes, fashion is fashion. 
###BORACHIO
C’mon, I might as well say the fool’s the fool! But don’t you see what a deformed villain fashion is? 
###WATCHMAN
(speaking so that only the other WATCHMEN can hear) I know that man, Deformed. For the past seven years, he’s been a wicked thief. He walks around as if he were a gentleman. I remember that name. 
###BORACHIO
Did you hear someone? 
###CONRADE
Just the weathervane moving. 
###BORACHIO
As I was saying, fashion is a deformed villain. It makes hot-blooded young men spin around feverishly, forever changing their appearances, dictating that sometimes they dress like Pharoah’s soldiers in that grimy painting and sometimes like the priests of the god Baal, as seen in old church windows. And sometimes fashion dresses them like the great Hercules in that dirty, worm-eaten tapestry—the one where his codpiece seems almost as big as his club. 
###CONRADE
I get all this. And I also understand how fashion changes so quickly that a man’s clothing never gets a chance to wear itself out. But you’re all wound up about fashion, too. Otherwise, why would you stray from your story to blabber on about it? 
###BORACHIO
No, I’m not wound up. But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight. I called her “Hero” the whole time. She leaned out of her mistress’s bedroom window and told me good night a thousand times—but I am telling this story poorly. I should backtrack and begin with how my master, Don John, arranged for the Prince, Claudio, and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard. 
###CONRADE
And they thought Margaret was Hero? 
###BORACHIO
The Prince and Claudio did, but the devil, my master, knew that it was Margaret. They believed the charade partially because of my master’s testimony—which first caused them to doubt Hero—and partially because of how dark and deceiving the night was, but mostly because of my villainous actions, which confirmed Don John’s slander. Claudio went away enraged, swearing that he’d meet Hero at the temple as planned and there, before the entire congregation, shame her with what he’d discovered and send her home without a husband. 
###SECOND WATCHMAN
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop! 
###FIRST WATCHMAN
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry. We have recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that was ever known in the commonwealth. 
###SECOND WATCHMAN
And one of them is the criminal Deformed. I know him; he wears a lock of hair. 
###CONRADE
Gentlemen, gentlemen— 
###SECOND WATCHMAN
(to BORACHIO) I bet you’ll be forced to bring Deformed forward. 
###FIRST WATCHMAN
Gentlemen, don’t speak. We obey you to go with us. 
###BORACHIO
We’re probably a very valuable catch for these guys. 
###CONRADE
Well, our value is debatable, I bet. Let’s go, we’ll obey you. 
##They all exit.
## HERO, MARGARET, andURSULA enter.
###HERO
Good Ursula, go wake my cousin and ask her to get up. 
###URSULA
I will, lady. 
###HERO
And request that she come here. 
###URSULA
Very well. 
##She exits.
###MARGARET
Really, I think your other ruff is better. 
###HERO
No, please good Meg, I’ll wear this one. 
###MARGARET
Honestly, it’s not as good as the other one, and I’m sure your cousin will agree with me. 
###HERO
My cousin’s a fool, and you are too. I’ll wear this one and none other. 
###MARGARET
I like your new wig and headdress, though I’d like it more if the hair were a shade browner. And your gown is really stylish. You know, I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown, the one that everyone praises so highly. 
###HERO
Oh, they say that dress surpasses all others. 
###MARGARET
Compared to your dress, it’s no better than a nightgown. The cloth is interwoven with gold thread, and slashes in the material show the fabric beneath. It is trimmed with silver lace and embroidered with pearls. It has one set of fitted sleeves and another ornamental pair that hangs open from the shoulders. The skirts are trimmed with a blue, metallic fabric. But for a fine, elegant, graceful, and excellent dress, yours is worth ten of those. 
###HERO
I hope I enjoy wearing it, for my heart is very heavy. 
###MARGARET
It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man. 
###HERO
Watch your tongue! Have you no shame? 
###MARGARET
Shame of what, lady? Sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar, right? And isn’t your husband an honorable man? You’re so prudish you’d probably like me to say, “I beg your pardon, your husband”—as if husband were a dirty word! So long as suspicious minds aren’t misinterpreting my honest words, I’ll offend no one. What’s wrong with admitting your husband’s going to lie on you? Nothing, as long as it’s the right husband with the right wife. That’s right and proper—anything else is frivolous and immoral. Ask Beatrice. Here she comes. 
## BEATRICE enters.
###HERO
Good morning, cousin. 
###BEATRICE
Good morning, sweet Hero. 
###HERO
Why do you sound so odd? Are you ill? You sound out of tune. 
###BEATRICE
I must be ill—I don’t think I can speak in any other tune. 
###MARGARET
If it’s a tune we want, let’s sing “Light on Love!” It’s a light song and doesn’t require a man to sing the baritone. You sing, and I’ll dance. 
###BEATRICE
You’re “light on love” sure enough—your frivolous dancing proves you have light heels! When you’re married one of these days, if your husband is rolling in dough, you’ll let him roll in the hay whenever he wants. 
###MARGARET
Never! I reject that life; I kick it away with my heels. 
###BEATRICE
(to HERO) It’s almost five o'clock, cousin. You should be ready by now. Oh, I really don’t feel well. Heigh-ho! 
###MARGARET
Are you sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband? 
###BEATRICE
I have an ache; I’m sighing for the letter that begins all those words. 
###MARGARET
Well, if you haven’t renounced your old faith yet, we can’t trust anything anymore. 
###BEATRICE
What does the fool mean by that, I wonder? 
###MARGARET
I don’t mean anything—but God sends everyone their heart’s desire. 
###HERO
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves. 
###BEATRICE
Sorry, I’m all stuffed. I can’t smell a thing. 
###MARGARET
Oh, just a young lady and already stuffed! That’s a nice way to catch a cold. 
###BEATRICE
Oh, God help me! Since when have you claimed to be such a great wit? 
###MARGARET
Ever since you lost yours. Doesn’t my wit suit me well? 
###BEATRICE
It doesn’t get seen enough; you should wear it in your cap, the way fools wear coxcombs. God, I’m really sick. 
###MARGARET
You should get some distilled carduus benedictus and put it on your chest. It’s the only way to cure a sudden faintness. 
###HERO
With that you’ve managed to prick her with a thistle. 
###BEATRICE
Benedictus! Why do you suggest I use benedictus? Is there some double meaning in that word, “benedictus”? 
###MARGARET
Double meaning! No, honestly, there’s no other meaning. I just meant that you should use some holy thistle. Maybe you think that I think you’re in love. No, by Our Lady, I’m not such a fool to think what I please, and I don’t please to think what I can, and in fact I cannot think, even if I could think my heart right past thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love. But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well, and now he’s become a real man. He swore that he’d never get married, but now, despite his earlier protestations, he loves ungrudgingly. How we’re going to convert you I’ll never know. And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does. 
###BEATRICE
Why are you talking at such a crazy clip? 
###MARGARET
It’s not a false gallop, anyway. 
## URSULA enters.
###URSULA
Madam, we have to go: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church. 
###HERO
Good cousin, good Meg, good Ursula, come help me get dressed. 
##They all exit.
## LEONATO enters withDOGBERRY andVERGES.
###LEONATO
What do you want from me, my good man? 
###DOGBERRY
Please, sir, I would like to discuss some news that decerns you greatly. 
###LEONATO
Be brief, please, because, as you can see, this is a busy time for me. 
###DOGBERRY
Indeed, sir, it is. 
###VERGES
Yes, it truly is. 
###LEONATO
What’s the news, my good friends? 
###DOGBERRY
Sorry, sir, Goodman Verges tends to ramble. He’s an old man, sir, and his wits are not as blunt as I wish they were. But truly, he’s as honest as the skin between his brows. 
###VERGES
Yes, I thank God that I am as honest as all the other old men who are not honester than me. 
###DOGBERRY
Making comparisons is odorous, Verges. Get on with your story. 
###LEONATO
Friends, you are becoming tedious. 
###DOGBERRY
Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers. But truly, if I were as tedious as a king, I would give everything to you, your Worship. 
###LEONATO
Oh, so you’d give me all your tediousness? 
###DOGBERRY
Yes, even if I had a thousand more pounds than that, for I hear that you are exclaimed throughout the city, and though I am only a poor man, it makes me glad to hear it. 
###VERGES
Me, too. 
###LEONATO
Gentlemen, please, I’d like to hear your news. 
###VERGES
Sir, our watch tonight—expectfully, sir—has captured a couple of the worst criminals in Messina. 
###DOGBERRY
(to LEONATO) Verges is a good old man, sir, but he’s always babbling. Like they say, “When age comes, wit goes.” God help us, what a world! (to VERGES) You did well, Verges, honestly. (to LEONATO) Well, God’s a fair man. If two men are riding on one horse, one must naturally ride behind. Verges is as honest a man as any, but, God bless him, not all men are created equal. Am I right, my friend? 
###LEONATO
Truly, my friend, he isn’t nearly as impressive as you are. 
###DOGBERRY
God gives those gifts—I had nothing to do with it. 
###LEONATO
Now I must return to the wedding. 
###DOGBERRY
One more thing, sir. Our watch, sir, as you know, has comprehended two auspicious persons. We’d like for you to examine them this morning. 
###LEONATO
Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings. Now I’m in a great hurry, as I’m sure you can see. 
###DOGBERRY
That will be suffigance. 
###LEONATO
Have some wine before you go. Goodbye. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
My lord, they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio. 
###LEONATO
I’m coming. 
## LEONATO and theMESSENGER exit.
###DOGBERRY
Go to Francis Seacole, the constable of the watch. Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail. We will now go to examination these men. 
###VERGES
We must do this wisely. 
###DOGBERRY
We won’t hold back any of our wisdom. We’ll drive them to a noncome. Go get the educated writer to record our excommunication, and I’ll meet you at the jail. 
##They all exit.
## DON PEDRO, DON JOHN,LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS,CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,HERO, and BEATRICE enter withATTENDANTS.
###LEONATO
All right, Friar Francis, let’s keep this short. Do a simple ceremony, and list all the particular duties of marriage later. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
(to CLAUDIO) Have you come here, my lord, to marry this lady? 
###CLAUDIO
No. 
###LEONATO
No, he comes to be married to her. Friar, you are the one who has come to marry her. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Lady, do you come here to be married to this count? 
###HERO
I do. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage, I order you on your souls to say so. 
###CLAUDIO
Do you know any, Hero? 
###HERO
None, my lord. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Do you know any, count? 
###LEONATO
I’m sure I can answer for him—he doesn’t know any, either. 
###CLAUDIO
Oh, the things men dare to do! The things men are allowed to do! The things men do daily, not knowing what they’re doing! 
###BENEDICK
What, are we playing with interjections? Well then, add some interjections that indicate laughter, like “ah,” “ha,” and “he!” 
###CLAUDIO
Hold on, Friar. (to LEONATO) Father, are you giving me your daughter freely? 
###LEONATO
As freely, son, as God gave her to me. 
###CLAUDIO
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift? 
###DON PEDRO
Nothing, sir, except grandchildren. 
###CLAUDIO
Good Prince, you have taught me how to accept things nobly. There, Leonato, take your daughter back. Don’t insult a friend by giving him a beautiful orange that rots inside. She only appears honorable from the outside. Look, how she blushes like a virgin! Oh, sin can disguise itself so artfully! Doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent? All of you who are looking at her, wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin, judging by these outward shows? But she is no virgin. She has been in a man’s bed. She blushes from guilt, not modesty. 
###LEONATO
What do you mean, my lord? 
###CLAUDIO
I won’t be married. I won’t join my soul to such a proven slut. 
###LEONATO
My dear lord, if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— 
###CLAUDIO
I know what you’re about to say. If I had slept with her, you’d say that we did so as husband and wife, merely anticipating our eventual marriage. No, Leonato. I never seduced her, or tempted her with indecent words. I treated her like a brother would treat a sister, with modest sincerity and appropriate affection. 
###HERO
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you? 
###CLAUDIO
Curse you for your false appearances! To me, you seemed like Diana in her orbit—as virginal as the flower bud before it blooms. But you’re actually as hot-blooded as Venus, or a pampered animal allowed to run wild. 
###HERO
Are you sick, my lord? Is that why you’re talking so wildly? 
###LEONATO
Good Prince, say something! 
###DON PEDRO
What should I say? I’ve been dishonored: I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore. 
###LEONATO
Are you really saying these things, or am I dreaming? 
###DON JOHN
They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true. 
###BENEDICK
This doesn’t look like a wedding. 
###HERO
It’s true! Oh God! 
###CLAUDIO
Leonato, am I standing here? Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother? Is this face Hero’s? Are these our eyes? 
###LEONATO
Yes, that’s all true—but what do you mean by it, my lord? 
###CLAUDIO
Let me just ask her one question, and by your authority as her father, order her to answer truthfully. 
###LEONATO
As my child, I order you to do so. 
###HERO
Oh, God help me! How I’m being attacked! What kind of game is this? 
###CLAUDIO
We just want you to answer to your real name. 
###HERO
Isn’t my name Hero? Who can stain that name with a just accusation? 
###CLAUDIO
Indeed, Hero herself can! You’ve stained your virtue with your own actions. What man were you talking to at your window last night, between the hours of midnight and one? If you’re a virgin, you’ll answer this question. 
###HERO
I wasn’t talking to any man at that time, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
Well then, you are no virgin. Leonato, I’m sorry you have to hear this. I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night. And that man confessed at length how he has secretly come to her bedroom thousands of times. 
###DON JOHN
No, my lord, don’t name her sinful acts or speak of them! There’s no way to describe them without offending everyone here. Pretty lady, I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior. 
###CLAUDIO
Oh Hero, you could have equaled the mythical Hero if only half your outward beauty matched your inner thoughts and desires! Goodbye, beautiful sinner. Goodbye to your pure wickedness and your wicked purity. Because of you, I’ll keep myself away from love. I’ll hang suspicion on my eyelids, so that all the beautiful things I see are transformed into dangers and are never able to trick me again. 
###LEONATO
Does anyone have a dagger for me? 
## HERO faints.
###BEATRICE
What’s wrong, cousin? Why have you collapsed? 
###DON JOHN
Come, let’s go. These revelations have overwhelmed her. 
## DON PEDRO DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO exit.
###BENEDICK
How is she? 
###BEATRICE
She’s dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—Hero, why Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar! 
###LEONATO
Oh Fate, don’t spare Hero from being punished! Death is the best way to cover over her shame. 
###BEATRICE
How are you, Hero? 
## HERO stirs.
###FRIAR FRANCIS
(to HERO) Take comfort, lady. 
###LEONATO
(to HERO) Are you looking up? 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Yes, why shouldn’t she? 
###LEONATO
Why not! Isn’t every living thing condemning her? Can she deny the accusations that are proven by her guilty blush? Die, Hero, don’t open your eyes. If I didn’t think you were about to die soon—if I thought your spirit could bear this shame—I would risk punishment and kill you myself. Am I sorry that I only had one child? Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty? Oh, one child is one too many! Why did I ever have one? Why did you once seem lovely to me? Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep, whose shame and dishonor I could have denied, not being its true father? But you were mine, and I loved and praised you for being mine, and was proud of you for being mine—I loved you so much that I hardly cared about myself. 
Oh, but now you have fallen into a pit of ink, and there’s not enough water in the whole wide sea to wash you clean again, and not enough salt to cover your stink. 
###BENEDICK
Sir, sir, calm down. I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say. 
###BEATRICE
Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely! 
###BENEDICK
Lady, did you sleep in her room last night? 
###BEATRICE
No, I didn’t, but I did every night for the past year. 
###LEONATO
Then it’s confirmed! That’s even more proof, and the case against her was airtight already. Would the two princes and Claudio lie? Claudio, who loved her so much that talking about her wickedness made him weep? 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Listen to me a moment. I’ve only remained silent this whole time because I’ve been watching Hero. I’ve seen her begin to blush a thousand times, only to watch those blushes disappear a thousand times and an innocent paleness take over her face. And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity. Call me a fool, don’t trust my observations—the truth of which is backed up by all my years of experience—don’t trust my age, my reputation, my position, and my holiness. 
You can doubt all these things if this sweet lady turns out to be guilty. 
###LEONATO
But she must be, Friar. You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges: she doesn’t want to add perjury to her list of sins. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Lady, who do they accuse you of having taken as your lover? 
###HERO
You should ask them. I don’t know who they’re talking about. If I’ve been with a man in any improper way, let all my sins be punished! Oh, father, if you yourself can prove that I talked with a man at an indecent hour, or indeed that I spoke to any creature last night, you can disown me, hate me, and torture me to death! 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding. 
###BENEDICK
Two of them are completely honorable, and if they have been tricked in this, we must blame John the Bastard, who lives to create conflict. 
###LEONATO
I don’t know. If they have spoken the truth about Hero, I will tear her apart with my bare hands. But if they have accused her falsely, even the greatest of them will have to deal with me. Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much, and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune, and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends, that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally, with money and friends at my disposal. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Hold on a moment, and listen to my advice. The princes left your daughter here for dead. Hide her for a while in your house, and tell everyone that she has, in fact, died. Make a bug show of mourning for her, hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb, and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies. 
###LEONATO
Why should we do this? What will this do? 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Listen, if we do this correctly, the men who slandered Hero will feel remorse for her instead. That will be a good thing. But I have an even greater goal in mind. We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused, and everyone who hears this will grieve for her, pity her, and excuse her actions. That’s how it goes: we don’t value the things we have until we lose them, when we suddenly rack up their value and see all the virtues we were blind to when they were alive and with us. That’s how Claudio will respond. When he hears that she died from his words, his imagination will be sweetly overtaken by thoughts of her. In death, every aspect of her life will be got up more beautifully, and in his mind she will seem more moving, more delicate, and more lively even than when she was alive. Then, if he ever truly felt love, he’ll mourn and wish he hadn’t accused her—even though he believed his accu- 
sation to be true. Follow my plan, and trust that the actual events will play out even better than I am describing. And even if they don’t, at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity. And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults. 
###BENEDICK
Signior Leonato, listen to the friar’s plan. And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio, I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly. 
###LEONATO
Because I’m drowning in my grief, I’ll grab onto the smallest piece of string dangled in front of me. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
This is a good agreement. Now, let’s go. A strange disease requires a strange cure. Come, lady; you must die in order to live. Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed. Have patience and endure. 
##Everyone but BENEDICK andBEATRICE exits.
###BENEDICK
Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time? 
###BEATRICE
Yes, and I’ll keep crying a while longer. 
###BENEDICK
I don’t wish that on you. 
###BEATRICE
You don’t have to; I do it of my own free will. 
###BENEDICK
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused. 
###BEATRICE
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me! 
###BENEDICK
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you? 
###BEATRICE
A very clear way, but there is no friend who will undertake it. 
###BENEDICK
Can a man do it? 
###BEATRICE
It’s a job meant for a man, but not you. 
###BENEDICK
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you. Isn’t that strange? 
###BEATRICE
It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand. I could just as easily say that there is nothing in the world that I love as much as you. But don’t believe me—though I’m not lying. I confess nothing, and I deny nothing. I feel awful for my cousin. 
###BENEDICK
By my sword, Beatrice, you love me. 
###BEATRICE
Don’t swear like that and then go back and eat it later. 
###BENEDICK
I’ll swear by my sword that you love me, too, and I’ll make any man who says that I don’t love you eat it. 
###BEATRICE
But you won’t eat your words? 
###BENEDICK
Not with any sauce they could provide for them. I swear, I love you. 
###BEATRICE
Well then, God forgive me! 
###BENEDICK
Why, what have you done, sweet Beatrice? 
###BEATRICE
You got to me first. I was about to swear that I loved you. 
###BENEDICK
Then do so, with all your heart. 
###BEATRICE
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with. 
###BENEDICK
Come, ask me to do anything for you. 
###BEATRICE
Kill Claudio. 
###BENEDICK
Ha! I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world. 
###BEATRICE
Then, rejecting my request, you kill me, instead. Goodbye. 
## BEATRICE begins to exit.
###BENEDICK
Wait, sweet Beatrice. 
###BEATRICE
My body waits here, but the rest of me is gone. You don’t really love me. I beg you to let me go. 
###BENEDICK
Beatrice— 
###BEATRICE
I swear, I’m going. 
###BENEDICK
Not until we part as friends. 
###BEATRICE
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy. 
###BENEDICK
Is Claudio your enemy? 
###BEATRICE
Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering, scorning, and dishonoring my cousin? Oh, I wish I were a man! He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows, and then—with public accusation, blatant slander, pure hatred—Oh God, if only I were a man! I would rip his heart out in public and eat it. 
###BENEDICK
Listen to me, Beatrice— 
###BEATRICE
Talking with a man outside her bedroom window! A likely story! 
###BENEDICK
No, but Beatrice— 
###BEATRICE
Sweet Hero, she’s been wronged, she’s been slandered, she’s been ruined. 
###BENEDICK
Beat— 
###BEATRICE
Princes and counts! Oh, of course, it was all so proper and ceremonious—they gave a truly princely testimony. He’s a proper count, that Count Sugarplum, a sweet gentleman, for sure! Oh, if only I were a man! Or had a friend who would be a man for me! But there are no real men left. Their manliness has melted into pretty curtsies and fancy manners, and their bravery is spent on making clever compliments. All this conversing has turned men into tongues—and fancy ones, at that. The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules. I can’t make myself a man by wishing I were, so as a woman I’ll die, from grieving. 
###BENEDICK
Wait, good Beatrice. I swear by this hand that I love you. 
###BEATRICE
Don’t just swear by it; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me. 
###BENEDICK
Do you honestly think, in your soul, that Claudio has wrongly accused Hero? 
###BEATRICE
Yes, as sure as I have a thought or a soul. 
###BENEDICK
That’s enough for me, then. I’ll challenge him. I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you. I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this. Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin. I’ll go tell them that she’s dead. Goodbye. 
##They exit.
## DOGBERRY, VERGES, the SEXTON (in his official gown), and theWATCHMEN enter, bringing CONRADE and BORACHIO.
###DOGBERRY
Is our whole dissembly here? 
###VERGES
Oh, we need a stool and a cushion for the sexton. 
##A stool is brought in. The SEXTON sits down.
###SEXTON
Which ones are the malefactors? 
###DOGBERRY
Sir, that would be me and my partner. 
###VERGES
Yes, yes, we’ve been exhibitioned to examine this case. 
###SEXTON
No, you’ve misunderstood me—where are the criminals whom I’m supposed to examine? Have them come in front of the master constable. 
###DOGBERRY
Yes, indeed, bring them before me. 
## BORACHIO and CONRADE come forward.
What’s your name, friend? 
###BORACHIO
Borachio. 
###DOGBERRY
Please, write down “Borachio.”—And yours? 
###CONRADE
I’m a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade. 
###DOGBERRY
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Gentlemen, are you good Christians, and do you serve God? 
###CONRADE, BORACHIO
Yes, sir, we hope so. 
###DOGBERRY
Write down that they hope they serve God. Oh, and write “God” first—for God forbid we put these criminals before God!—Gentlemen, it’s already been proven that you aren’t much better than lying criminals, and soon we’ll know almost for certain. How do you both plead? 
###CONRADE
Honestly, sir, we say that we are not criminals. 
###DOGBERRY
He’s a marvelously witty fellow, no doubt, but I’ll outmaneuver him.—Come over here; I’ll whisper a word in your ear. Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals. 
###BORACHIO
Sir, I tell you that we are not. 
###DOGBERRY
Well, okay.—I swear to God, both their stories match. Have you written that down, that they aren’t criminals? 
###SEXTON
Master Constable, you’re going about this all wrong. First, you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them. 
###DOGBERRY
Yes, good idea; that’s the eftest way. Bring the watchmen forward. Gentlemen, I order you in the Prince’s name to accuse these men. 
###FIRST WATCHMAN
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain. 
###DOGBERRY
Write down that Prince John is a villain. Why, that’s flat-out perjury—to call a prince’s brother a villain. 
###BORACHIO
Master Constable— 
###DOGBERRY
Be quiet, you. I swear, I don’t like the look of you. 
###SEXTON
(to the watchmen) What else did you hear him say? 
###SECOND WATCHMAN
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero. 
###DOGBERRY
That’s burglary, that is. 
###VERGES
Yes, by God, that it is. 
###SEXTON
What else did you hear? 
###FIRST WATCHMAN
I heard that Count Claudio meant to disgrace Hero in front of the whole wedding party and refuse to marry her. 
###DOGBERRY
(to BORACHIO) Oh, you villain! You’ll be condemned to everlasting redemption for this! 
###SEXTON
What else? 
###FIRST WATCHMAN
That’s all. 
###SEXTON
(to CONRADE and BORACHIO) You can’t deny this, gentlemen. This morning, Prince John secretly snuck out of Messina. Hero was accused exactly as the watchman described, and died on the spot from the grief. Master Constable, tie up these men and bring them to Leonato’s. I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out. 
##He exits.
###DOGBERRY
Come on, let’s get them opinioned. 
###VERGES
Let them be in the hands— 
###CONRADE
Get off me, you fool! 
###DOGBERRY
Honest to God, where’s the sexton? He should write down that the Prince’s officer was called a fool. Come on, tie them up. (to CONRADE) You’re a nasty little stinker! 
###CONRADE
Get away from me, you ass! You ass! 
###DOGBERRY
How can you call me that? Don’t you suspect my office? Don’t you suspect my age? Oh, if only the sexton were here to write down that I’m an ass! Gentlemen, remember that I am an ass; even though it’s not written down, don’t forget that I’m an ass. Oh, you’re a rotten bastard, you are. I’m a wise man and, what’s more, I’m an officer of the law and, what’s more, I’m a householder and, what’s more, I’m as handsome a hunk of meat as any in Messina. And I know the law, damn you, and I’m rich enough, damn you, and I used to have more, but I still have two robes and lots of lovely things.—Take him away!—Oh, if only the sexton had recorded that I’m an ass! 
##They all exit.
## LEONATO and ANTONIO enter.
###ANTONIO
If you keep on the way you’ve been going, you’ll kill yourself. There’s no point in adding to your grief. 
###LEONATO
Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve. Don’t counsel me. Only someone who’s been wronged as I have can comfort me. Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and askhim to be patient. Compare the length and width of that man’s sadness against my own; match up all the complaints and strong emotions that run through our bodies. If a man who has suffered as I have gave me advice the way you do—smiling and stroking his beard, telling me to toss away my sorrow, giving speeches when he should be wailing with me, trying to heal my grief with little proverbs, spinning my head around with philosophy—then I would take his advice and be patient. But that man doesn’t exist. You can try to comfort a man who feels a pain that you have never felt, but once you feel it too, your sober advice will also turn into passion. You can’t treat madness with rules or bind up insanity with little silken threads or cure heartache with hot air or lighten agony with pat phrases. 
Every man thinks it’s his duty to advise those who are overwrought with sorrow to be patient. But no man is so moral or so strong that they can endure the same advice when they themselves are grieving. So don’t advise me. My sorrow is crying too loudly to hear what you have to say. 
###ANTONIO
Well then you’re no better than a child. 
###LEONATO
Please, leave me alone. I intend to be flesh and blood, not airy philosophy, for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently, even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune. 
###ANTONIO
But don’t take all that pain on yourself. Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too. 
###LEONATO
Now you’re talking. I definitely will. In my soul, I believe Hero has been falsely accused. And I’ll make sure that Claudio, the Prince, and anyone else who helped dishonor her know about it. 
## DON PEDRO andCLAUDIO enter.
###ANTONIO
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way. 
###DON PEDRO
Good evening, good evening. 
###CLAUDIO
Good day to both of you. 
###LEONATO
Listen, my lords— 
###DON PEDRO
We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato. 
###LEONATO
A bit of a hurry, my lord! Well then, good bye, my lord. You’re in a hurry, are you? Well then, don’t bother. 
###DON PEDRO
Come on, don’t quarrel with us, good old man. 
###ANTONIO
If it’s fighting he is after, some of us here should run and hide. 
###CLAUDIO
Who has wronged him? 
###LEONATO
Indeed, you have wronged me, you liar. Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword. I’m not scared of you. 
###CLAUDIO
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you. Really, I had no intention of going for my sword. 
###LEONATO
Damn you, don’t mock and sneer at me. I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old. Claudio, I’m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child. I am forced to lay aside my old man’s respectability, and with my gray hairs and my aching body I challenge you to a duel. You have ruined my innocent child. Your slander has broken her heart, and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb—ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness. 
###CLAUDIO
My wickedness? 
###LEONATO
Yours, Claudio, yours, I say. 
###DON PEDRO
You’ve got it wrong, old man. 
###LEONATO
My lord, if he dares to accept my challenge, I’ll beat him and prove he’s guilty. I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does, despite his youth and manliness. 
###CLAUDIO
Not a chance! I’ll have nothing to do with you. 
###LEONATO
You think you can get rid of me that easily? You killed my child. Take on someone your own size: if you kill me, boy, you’ll have killed a man. 
###ANTONIO
He’ll have to kill both of us, and indeed we’re both men. But let him start off easy by killing one of us. Come on—kill me and brag about it! Let me at him. Come on, come after me, little boy. Come on and get me. Little man, I’ll be right in your face with my sword. I will, as surely as I am a gentleman. 
###LEONATO
Brother— 
###ANTONIO
Quiet. God knows I loved my niece, and now she’s dead—slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue. Boys, fools, braggers, scoundrels, babies! 
###LEONATO
Brother Anthony— 
###ANTONIO
Hold your peace. I know their kind, I know them exactly. They’re petulant, disrespectful, fashion-crazy boys who lie and cheat and mock, defame and slander. They walk around in outlandish outfits, pretending to be brave and wild and saying a few inflammatory things about how they’ll hurt their enemies—and that’s all they do. 
###LEONATO
But brother Anthony— 
###ANTONIO
Don’t, it’s no big deal. Don’t bother with it. Let me deal with this. 
###DON PEDRO
Gentlemen, we won’t stay here and anger you further. I’m sorry about your daughter’s death, but I swear our accusations were true, and backed up with proof. 
###LEONATO
My lord, my lord— 
###DON PEDRO
I don’t want to hear any more about it. 
###LEONATO
No? Come on, brother! I’m determined to be heard by someone. 
###ANTONIO
And you will be, or some people here will suffer for it. 
## LEONATO and ANTONIO exit.
## BENEDICK enters.
###DON PEDRO
Look, here comes just the man we were looking for. 
###CLAUDIO
What’s up, mister? 
###BENEDICK
(to DON PEDRO) Hello, my lord. 
###DON PEDRO
Welcome, sir. You just missed a fight that was barely avoided. 
###CLAUDIO
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth. 
###DON PEDRO
Leonato and his brother. What do you think? I think if we had fought, we would have proven too young and strong for them after all. 
###BENEDICK
There’s no bravery in an unfair fight. I’ve been look- ing for you two. 
###CLAUDIO
We’ve been looking for you, too. We’re really depressed. Will you tell us some jokes to beat our sad- ness away? 
###BENEDICK
My wit’s in my scabbard. Should I unsheath it? 
###DON PEDRO
You wear your wit next to you? 
###CLAUDIO
No one carries their wit next to them, though some people are beside their wit. Come on, draw your wit, just as musicians draw their bows across the instru- ments: draw for our pleasure. 
###DON PEDRO
Look: Benedick is so pale—are you sick, or angry? 
###CLAUDIO
(to BENEDICK) Buck up, man! Care may have killed the cat, but you are strong enough to kill care. Lighten up. 
###BENEDICK
Sir, don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits. I’ll meet all your attacks, even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop. Choose another tack. 
###CLAUDIO
(to DON PEDRO) That was poor, Benedick! Give him another lance—that last one got broken in half. 
###DON PEDRO
Lord, he seems to be getting paler by the minute. I think he really is angry. 
###CLAUDIO
If he is, that’s his problem. 
###BENEDICK
Can I have a word with you privately? 
###CLAUDIO
God forbid he wants to challenge me! 
###BENEDICK
(speaking so that only CLAUDIOcan hear) You are a vil- lain. I’m not kidding. I challenge you however you like—with whatever weapons you choose, and whe- never you want. Meet this challenge, or I’ll say that you’re a coward. You’ve killed an innocent woman, and you’re going to pay dearly for her death. What do you say? 
###CLAUDIO
I’ll be there, and I’ll enjoy myself. 
###DON PEDRO
What, are we having a feast? 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, we are. He has invited me to have a calf’s head and a capon. He says if I don’t carve them up and serve them elegantly, he’ll declare I have no skills with a knife. Should I go get us a woodcock, too? 
###BENEDICK
Sir, you have a very slow, rambling wit. 
###DON PEDRO
Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day. I said you had a fine wit. “True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said, “a wise gentleman.”“No,” I said, “he can speak many languages:” “I can believe that,” she said, “because he swore one thing to me on Monday night and took it back on Tuesday morning. He spoke two languages then.” She turned all your virtues into vices just about an hour ago. But in the end she sighed and admitted you were the handsomest man in Italy. 
###CLAUDIO
She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care. 
###DON PEDRO
That she did. And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death. Leonato’s daughter had told us everything. 
###CLAUDIO
Absolutely everything. And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden. 
###DON PEDRO
But when exactly will we see Benedick married? 
###CLAUDIO
Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”? 
###BENEDICK
Goodbye, boy. You know what I intend. I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman. The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses. I’m leaving your court now. 
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina. The three of you have killed a sweet, innocent woman. Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then. 
##He exits.
###DON PEDRO
He’s serious. 
###CLAUDIO
Very serious, and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice. 
###DON PEDRO
And he challenged you to a duel? 
###CLAUDIO
He did, very sincerely. 
###DON PEDRO
What a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home! 
###CLAUDIO
A guy like that is bigger than an ape, but the ape could be his doctor, it’s so much smarter. 
###DON PEDRO
But wait a minute. Let me gather my wits and get serious here. Didn’t he say my brother has run away? 
## DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the WATCHMEN enter with CONRADE and BORACHIO.
###DOGBERRY
Come on, you. If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power. Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you. 
###DON PEDRO
What’s this? Two of my brother’s men, all tied up! And Borachio is one of them! 
###CLAUDIO
Find out what they’re being held for. 
###DON PEDRO
Officers, what crime have these men committed? 
###DOGBERRY
Well sir, they’ve lied; moreover, they have said things that were not true; secondarily, they are slanderers; sixth and lastly, they have falsely accused a lady; thirdly, they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen; and, in conclusion, they are lying scoundrels. 
###DON PEDRO
First, I ask you what they’ve done; thirdly, I ask you what offense they’re charged with; sixth and lastly, I ask you why they’ve been committed here; and, in conclusion, I ask what they’re accused of. 
###CLAUDIO
Nicely done, and organized in just the way he’ll understand. My God, he manages to say the same thing six different ways. 
###DON PEDRO
(to BORACHIO and CONRADE) What have you done, gentlemen? This educated constable is too brilliant for me to understand. What is your crime? 
###BORACHIO
Prince, I won’t wait for my trial: listen to my story, and let the count kill me now. I tricked your own eyes. These stupid fools have uncovered what you in all your wisdom could not. They heard me confess to Conrade how Don John, your brother, prompted me to slander Hero—how you came to the orchard and saw me making sexual advances toward Margaret, who was disguised as Hero; how you disgraced Hero when you should have married her. They’ve recorded my crimes, and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story. The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master. I desire nothing now but a criminal’s punishment. 
###DON PEDRO
(to CLAUDIO) Doesn’t this make your blood run cold? 
###CLAUDIO
His words are like poison to me. 
###DON PEDRO
(to BORACHIO) But did my brother prompt you to do all this? 
###BORACHIO
Yes, and paid me well for doing it. 
###DON PEDRO
He is made of treachery, and has run away to avoid his crimes. 
###CLAUDIO
Sweet Hero; when I imagine you now, you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you. 
###DOGBERRY
Come, take away the plaintiffs. By now the sexton will have reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. (to CLAUDIO and DON PEDRO) And, gentlemen, please do not forget to specify, whenever it is convenient, that I am an ass. 
###VERGES
Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton. 
## LEONATO and ANTONIO enter with the SEXTON.
###LEONATO
Which one of them did it? Let me see what he looks like, so when I see another man who resembles him, I’ll know to avoid him. Which one is it? 
###BORACHIO
If you want to see your deceiver, then look at me. 
###LEONATO
Are you the slave who, with your slanderous words, killed my innocent child? 
###BORACHIO
Yes, I am the one. 
###LEONATO
No, villain, but you didn’t work alone. (indicating CLAUDIO and DON PEDRO) For here are two noblemen —the third has run away—who helped you. (to CLAUDIO and DON PEDRO) Thank you, gentlemen, for my daughter’s death. Make a note of it on your long lists of righteous and worthy deeds. It was very brave of you. 
###CLAUDIO
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something. Choose your revenge. Punish me through any means you can devise, though I sinned by mistake. 
###DON PEDRO
Me too—but to satisfy this good old man, I too will bear any punishment he gives me. 
###LEONATO
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died. And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones. Sing it tonight. Then come to my house tomorrow morning, and since you couldn’t be my son-in-law, be my nephew instead. My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates. Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die. 
###CLAUDIO
Oh, noble sir! Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep. I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands. 
###LEONATO
I will see you tomorrow, then. Now I have to leave. This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot. 
###BORACHIO
No, she wasn’t, and she didn’t know anything about it. She has always been honest and good. 
###DOGBERRY
(to LEONATO) Also, sir, this hasn’t been put down in writing, but I should let you know that this plaintiff here, the criminal, did in fact call me an ass. Please remember that when you’re punishing him. Plus, the watchmen heard the criminals talking about some man named Deformed. They say that he has an earring made out of a key, with a lock hanging from it. Apparently, he borrows money from people in the name of God and then never pays it back, which angers everyone so much that they now refuse to fund anything in the name of God. Make sure you ask him about this. 
###LEONATO
Thank you for all your efforts. 
###DOGBERRY
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you. 
###LEONATO
(giving DOGBERRY money) This is for your trouble. 
###DOGBERRY
God save the charitable organization! 
###LEONATO
Go, you’re relieved of your duty. Thank you. 
###DOGBERRY
I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of. God bless your Worship! I wish you well. I hope that God restores you to health. I will humbly let you go now, God prohibiting we will meet again in the future.—Come on, man. 
## DOGBERRY and VERGES exit.
###LEONATO
I’ll see you tomorrow morning, gentlemen. 
###ANTONIO
Goodbye, gentlemen. We’ll see you tomorrow. 
###DON PEDRO
We’ll be there. 
###CLAUDIO
I will mourn Hero tonight. 
###LEONATO
(to the watchmen) Bring these criminals with us. We’ll go talk to Margaret, to see how she got involved with this worthless man. 
##They all exit.
## BENEDICK andMARGARET enter.
###BENEDICK
Please Margaret, help me write this poem for Beatrice. 
###MARGARET
Afterward, will you write a sonnet for me, praising my beauty? 
###BENEDICK
I’ll write you such a glorious sonnet, Margaret, that no man will ever be able to come over it. You certainly deserve it. 
###MARGARET
No man will come over me! What a life that would be! 
###BENEDICK
Your wit is as quick as a greyhound’s jaws—it catches whatever it goes after. 
###MARGARET
And your wit is as blunt as a practice sword, with its dull tip; it hits people but doesn’t hurt them. 
###BENEDICK
It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly, Margaret, and refuses to hurt a woman. Now please, tell Beatrice to come out. I admit defeat; I give you the bucklers. 
###MARGARET
No, you should give a woman your sword—we have our own bucklers! 
###BENEDICK
Watch out, though, Margaret—virgins shouldn’t be brandishing their bucklers around. 
###MARGARET
I’ll go get Beatrice for you, who can walk here by herself—she has legs. 
###BENEDICK
So that means she’ll come. 
## MARGARET exits.
(singing)  The god of love  He sits in heaven above  And he knows me, he knows me  He knows how much pity I deserve— I’m really a pitiful singer. But as a lover, well, that’s another story. Take Leander, Troilus, or an entire book’s worth of those legendary lover–boys, whose names sound so smooth and nice in a line of verse—not one of them has been driven as crazy by love as I have been. But I can’t prove it in a poem. I have tried. I can’t think of any rhyme for “lady” but “baby,” which is a childish rhyme. The only rhyme for “scorn” I can come up with is “horn”—a bit off for a love poem. Nothing rhymes with “school” but “fool,” and that’s a ridiculous jingle. These are all very unpromising line endings. No, I wasn’t destined to be a poet, and I can’t woo a lady with pretty words. 
## BEATRICE enters.
Beatrice, have you come because I called for you? 
###BEATRICE
Yes, sir, and I’ll leave when you ask me to. 
###BENEDICK
Oh, well, stay till then! 
###BEATRICE
There—you said “then.” So I’ll leave now. But before I go, let me get what I came for. What happened between you and Claudio? 
###BENEDICK
I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you. 
###BEATRICE
If you had foul words in your mouth, then your breath must be foul, and foul breath is nauseating. Thus, I’ll leave without being kissed. 
###BENEDICK
Your wit is so forceful, it frightens the very meaning out of your words. But I will tell you this very plainly: I have challenged Claudio, and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward. Now, tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first? 
###BEATRICE
With all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix. But tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me? 
###BENEDICK
Suffer love! That’s a good way of putting it. I do suffer love, because I love you against my will. 
###BEATRICE
You love me in spite of your heart, I think. If you spite your heart for my sake, then I will spite it for yours. I will never love the thing my friend hates. 
###BENEDICK
You and I are too wise to woo each other peacefully. 
###BEATRICE
It’s said that no truly wise man will praise himself. If you say that you are wise, it’s likely you’re not. 
###BENEDICK
That’s an old proverb, Beatrice, from the time when neighbors praised each other. In this day and age, if a man doesn’t erect his own monument before he dies, he won’t be remembered past the funeral bell’s ringing and his widow’s crying. 
###BEATRICE
Exactly how long is that, do you think? 
###BENEDICK
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying. That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues, like I do. That’s why I praise myself, who—if I do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy. But tell me, how is your cousin? 
###BEATRICE
She’s very sick. 
###BENEDICK
And how are you? 
###BEATRICE
I’m very sick, too. 
###BENEDICK
Have faith, love me, and you will get better. And that’s where I’ll end, because someone is hurrying this way. 
## URSULA enters.
###URSULA
Madam, you have to go to your uncle’s. There’s a huge racket going on there. It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent, that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived, and that Don John—who has run away—is the source of all the trouble. Will you come immediately? 
##She exits.
###BEATRICE
Will you come with me to hear this news, sir? 
###BENEDICK
I will live in your heart, die in your lap, and be buried in your eyes—and, what’s more, I will go with you to your uncle’s. 
##They exit.
## DON PEDROand CLAUDIO enter with three or four LORDS carrying candles, and musicians.
###CLAUDIO
Is this the family tomb of Leonato? 
###FIRST LORD
It is, my lord. 
###CLAUDIO
(reading an epitaph) Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words. To repay her for her troubles, Death Gives her undying fame. So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame. 
##(he hangs the scroll)
This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die. Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn. (singing)  Please pardon, goddess of the night,  The men who killed your virgin knight.  These men now walk around her tomb,  Singing songs of woe.  Oh, midnight, join our moaning  Help us with our sighs and groaning  Heavily, heavily.  Graves, open up and release your corpses  Until Hero’s death is fully mourned  Heavily, heavily. 
###CLAUDIO
Now I say good night to your bones, Hero. I will perform this ceremony every year. 
###DON PEDRO
Good morning, gentlemen. Put out your torches. The wolves have finished preying for the night, and look—the gentle dawn is rising, dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light. 
###CLAUDIO
Good morning, gentlemen. We go our separate ways. 
## LORDS and musicians exit
###DON PEDRO
Come, let’s go and change our clothes. Then we’ll visit Leonato’s. 
###CLAUDIO
And I hope Hymen will give us better luck than Hero got. 
##They all exit.
## LEONATO, ANTONIO,BENEDICK, BEATRICE,MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO enter.
###FRIAR FRANCIS
Didn’t I tell you she was innocent? 
###LEONATO
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John. Margaret is partially guilty, although our investigation shows that she acted unintentionally. 
###ANTONIO
Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out. 
###BENEDICK
Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio. 
###LEONATO
Hero, you and the other women should all retreat to a room. When I send for you, come out wearing masks. The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now.—You know your job, brother. You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio. 
##The ladies exit.
###ANTONIO
I’ll do that, without giving away our secret. 
###BENEDICK
Friar, I think I need a favor from you. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
What do you need me to do? 
###BENEDICK
To tie me up, or to undo me: one or the other. Signior Leonato, the truth is, your niece likes me. 
###LEONATO
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her, it’s true. 
###BENEDICK
And I see her also through the eyes of love. 
###LEONATO
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio, the Prince, and me. But what did you want? 
###BENEDICK
Sir, I’m puzzled by what you just said. But as far as what I want—I want you to give Beatrice and me your blessing to be married. That, good Friar, is where you come in. 
###LEONATO
Our wishes are aligned, then: I give you my blessing. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
And I’ll help you. Here comes the Prince and Claudio. 
## DON PEDRO andCLAUDIO enter with two or three others.
###DON PEDRO
Good morning to all these lovely people. 
###LEONATO
Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio. We’re waiting here for you. Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter? 
###CLAUDIO
I wouldn’t change my mind even if she were black-skinned. 
###LEONATO
Bring her out, brother. The friar’s ready. 
## ANTONIO exits.
###DON PEDRO
Good morning, Benedick. What’s the matter? Your face looks like the month of February—full of frost, storms, and cloudiness. 
###CLAUDIO
I think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated. Oh, don’t worry about it—we’ll dip your horns in gold and make you pretty, and you’ll delight all of Europe, just like Jove delighted Europa when he was a bull. 
###BENEDICK
Jove came to earth lowing for love. A strange bull just like him mated with one of your father’s cows and, voilà, gave birth to a calf like you—you bleat the same as him. 
###CLAUDIO
I’ll get you for that one. But here are other matters to be dealt with. 
## ANTONIO, HERO,BEATRICE, MARGARET,URSULA enter. The ladies wear masks.
Which is the lady I’m supposed to marry? 
###LEONATO
This one, and I will give her to you. 
###CLAUDIO
Well, then she’s the one for me. Sweetheart, let me see your face. 
###LEONATO
No, you can’t do that until you take her hand and, in front of this friar, swear to marry her. 
###CLAUDIO
(to HERO) Give me your hand. With the friar as my witness, I am your husband, if you want me. 
###HERO
And when I lived, I was your other wife. And when you loved me, you were my other husband.(she removes her mask) 
###CLAUDIO
It’s another Hero! 
###HERO
Exactly right. One Hero died when she was slandered, but I am alive. And as surely as I am alive, I am a virgin. 
###DON PEDRO
It’s the former Hero! The Hero that died! 
###LEONATO
She was only dead, my lord, as long as her slander lived. 
###FRIAR FRANCIS
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true. After the wedding ceremony, I’ll tell you all about beautiful Hero’s “death.” In the meantime, just accept all these wonderful things, and let’s head to the chapel. 
###BENEDICK
Wait a moment, Friar. Which one of you is Beatrice? 
###BEATRICE
(taking off her mask) That’s my name. What do you want? 
###BENEDICK
Do you love me? 
###BEATRICE
No, no more than is reasonable. 
###BENEDICK
Well then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived. They swore you did. 
###BEATRICE
Do you love me? 
###BENEDICK
Truly, no—no more than is reasonable. 
###BEATRICE
Well then, Margaret, Ursula, and my cousin have been very much deceived, for they swore you did. 
###BENEDICK
They swore that you were sick with love for me. 
###BEATRICE
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me. 
###BENEDICK
Oh, well. So you don’t love me? 
###BEATRICE
No, I don’t—except as a friend. 
###LEONATO
Come on, niece, I’m sure you love him. 
###CLAUDIO
And I’ll swear that he loves her. Here’s a clumsy sonnet, in Benedick’s handwriting, dedicated to Beatrice. (holding up a piece of paper) 
###HERO
And here’s another poem, which I stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick. (holding up a piece of paper) 
###BENEDICK
What a miracle! Our handwriting gives away our hearts. Come on, I’ll take you, but honestly I’m only doing it out of pity. 
###BEATRICE
I won’t say no to you, but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life —I hear you were quickly wasting away without me. 
###BENEDICK
Oh, shut up! I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss. 
##They kiss.
###DON PEDRO
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man? 
###BENEDICK
I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today. You think I care what I’m called? Well, I don’t. If a man is always afraid of what others think, he won’t even dare to dress nicely, because he’ll be afraid people will talk about him. In short, since I intend to get married, I won’t hear anyone say a bad thing about it. So don’t go making fun of me for what I said before. Man is a giddy, flighty thing: that’s my conclusion. And Claudio—though I’m sure I would have beaten you in our duel—since you’re likely to become my relative, I’ll let you go, unbruised, and love my cousin Hero. 
###CLAUDIO
I was sort of hoping you would say no to Beatrice, so that I could have smacked you out of your single life and made you a double dealer. Which you’ll probably turn into anyway, if my cousin Beatrice doesn’t keep you on a short leash. 
###BENEDICK
Come on, we’re all friends. Let’s do a dance, and have some fun, before we’re wed. 
###LEONATO
We’ll dance after the wedding. 
###BENEDICK
No, before! Musicians, play us a song.—Prince, you look sad. You should get a wife! Your royal staff would be so much more impressive if it were topped off by a horn. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
(to DON PEDRO) My lord, your brother John was caught by armed soldiers as he fled. He’s been brought back to Messina. 
###BENEDICK
(to DON PEDRO) Leave him till tomorrow. I’ll think of some awful punishment for him. Play on, musicians! 
##They all dance.
##They all exit.

##A room in the DUKE’S palace.
## DUKE VINCENTIO enters, with ESCALUS and several lords and attendants.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Escalus. 
###ESCALUS 
Yes, my lord? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO
Explaining government affairs always makes me talk excitedly. But since you know more about matters of government than I can ever tell you, the only thing left for me to say is this: rely on your natural ability, and let it work with your knowledge. You know as much, from both learning and experience, about the nature of our people, our city’s laws and procedures, and our legal system as anyone I can think of. Here are your written orders; do not deviate from them. [To Attendants.] Go and order Angelo to come to me. 
##An attendant exits.
How do you think he’ll represent me? For you must know, after careful consideration, I’ve chosen him to rule in my absence, deputizing him with the dread and love my presence inspires, and transferring to him all the tools in my power. What do you think? 
###ESCALUS 
If anyone in Vienna deserves such an honor, it’s Lord Angelo. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Here he comes. 
## ANGELO enters.
###ANGELO 
Here I am, obedient as always; what can I do for you? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Angelo, there is a distinctive pattern to your life that tells people what sort of man you are. But your talents don’t belong to you alone, and you mustn’t waste them by keeping them to yourself. Heaven uses us the way we use a torch—not to shine for itself, but to shed light onto the world. If we don't use our talents in the world, it would be the same as if we didn't have those talents at all. People are given certain natures to accomplish certain things. Mother Nature doesn’t lend you even a smidgen of talent without expecting you to pay her back—with interest and gratitude. But here I am talking to someone who could instruct me! So, stand firm, Angelo—in my absence, you’ll stand in for me completely. Vienna’s criminals will be executed or pardoned based on what you feel and say. Although old Escalus is senior to you, he’ll be your second-in-command. Take your written orders. 
###ANGELO 
My good lord, please test me further before you raise me to such a high, prominent position. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
No more procrastinating. I’ve chosen you after careful consideration, so accept the honor. It’s imperative that I leave now, even if it means leaving some important matters undiscussed. I’ll write to you when I have the time and feel the need, telling you how I am, and I’ll expect to hear how you’re doing. So, goodbye; I’ll leave you to carry out your orders—successfully, no doubt. 
###ANGELO 
My lord, will you allow us to escort you part of the way? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Sorry, I’m in too big a rush. But please don’t have any doubts—you have all my authority to enforce or change the laws in any way that seems good to you. Let’s shake hands, and I’ll sneak off. I love the people but don’t like to parade before them. I don’t like their loud applause and emphatic cheering, though they can be politically useful; nor do I trust the judgment of any man who does desire such cheers and applause. Once again, goodbye. 
###ANGELO 
May heaven grant you a safe trip! 
###ESCALUS 
A happy departure, and a happy homecoming as well! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO
Thank you. Goodbye. 
##He exits.
###ESCALUS 
Sir, I’d like to have a frank talk with you because I want to figure out the exact nature of my new job. I know I’ve got some authority, but how much, and what kind, I’m not clear on. 
###ANGELO 
Same with me. Let’s leave together and we'll go figure it out. 
###ESCALUS 
I’ll accompany you. 
##Everyone exits.
##A street.
## LUCIO and two Gentlemen enter. 
###LUCIO 
If our Duke, along with the other Dukes, can’t reach an agreement with the King of Hungary, they’re all going to attack him. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
May God give us peace—except not with Hungary. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Amen. 
###LUCIO 
You talk like the self-righteous pirate who went to sea with the Ten Commandments but cut out one of the commandments. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Was it “Thou shalt not steal”? 
###LUCIO 
Yep, that’s the one. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Right, because that commandment would’ve put the captain and his pirate crew out of business—they went to sea to steal. When grace is being said before a meal, there’s not a soldier among us who likes a prayer for peace. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
I never heard any soldier say he dislikes it. 
###LUCIO 
I believe you—I don’t think you’ve ever been at a table where they said grace. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
No? I’ve heard it a dozen times at least. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
What, in verse? 
###LUCIO 
In any form or in any language. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Or in any religion. 
###LUCIO 
Well, why not? Grace is grace, no matter what your religious beliefs are, just like you’re a scoundrel, no matter how much grace you have. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Hey, you and me are cut from the same cloth. 
###LUCIO 
Right—the way a piece of velvet and the scrap ends are from the same cloth. You’re the scrap. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
And you’re the velvet: a nice, thick piece of piled velvet. I swear, I’d rather be a piece of plain, English cloth than be like you, a French velvet that’s full of piles and STDs. Got you there, didn’t I? 
###LUCIO 
I think you did, and from the painful way you talk, I think something’s got you down there. I’d be glad to toast your health; just remind me never to drink from your glass after you. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
I guess I set myself up, didn’t I? 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Yeah, you did, whether you’ve got something or not. 
###LUCIO 
Oh, look, here comes Madam Satisfaction. The number of venereal diseases I’ve caught under her roof comes to— 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
To what? 
###LUCIO 
Guess. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Three thousand dollars’ worth. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Yeah, and more. 
###LUCIO 
A syphilis sore more. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
You’re always suggesting I’m diseased, but you’re wrong. I’m sound and healthy. 
###LUCIO 
You may be sound, but you’re not healthy. Your bones sound hollow. Loose living has eaten out your insides. 
## MISTRESS OVERDONE enters.
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Hey, there! In which hip is the pain of your sciatica worse? 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Well, well. There’s someone over there who’s been arrested and hauled off to prison who was worth five thousand of you all. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Who’s that? 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
That’s Claudio, Signior Claudio. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Claudio in prison? It can’t be true. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
I know it's true: I saw him arrested and saw him carried away, and what’s more, they’re chopping his head off in three days. 
###LUCIO 
All kidding aside, I’d hate for this to be true. Are you sure? 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
I’m all too sure. It’s for getting Miss Julietta pregnant. 
###LUCIO 
She might be right about this. He promised to meet me two hours ago, and he always keeps his promises. 
###SECOND GENTLEMAN 
You know, this is exactly the sort of thing we were just talking about. 
###FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Most of all it fits with the public proclamation that was made. 
###LUCIO 
Let’s go see if we can get to the bottom of this. 
## LUCIO and the Gentlemen exit. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
What with the war, plague, executions, and general poverty, I’m losing business. 
## POMPEY enters. 
Hi! what’s new with you? 
###POMPEY 
That man over there is being hauled off to prison. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
What did he do? 
###POMPEY 
A woman. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
But what’s his crime? 
###POMPEY 
Fishing in the “private part” of a river. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
What, a virgin is pregnant because of him? 
###POMPEY 
No, but a woman’s having a child because of him. You haven’t heard about the proclamation, have you? 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
What proclamation, man? 
###POMPEY 
All the brothels in the suburbs of Vienna must be torn down. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
And what about those in the city? 
###POMPEY 
They’ll be left standing. They would’ve been destroyed, too, but a savvy businessman bought them. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
But all our brothels in the suburbs are going to be demolished? 
###POMPEY 
Down to the ground, ma’am. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Wow, that's a change for the country. What’s going to happen to me? 
###POMPEY 
Come on, don’t worry. Good lawyers never lack for clients. Though you change locations, you don’t need to change professions. I’ll still be your pimp. Courage! They’ll take pity on you; all of you that have grown old and gray servicing people will be repaid. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
What’s all this fuss, Thomas Tapster? Let’s get out of here. 
###POMPEY 
Here comes Signior Claudio, led to prison by the provost. And there's Miss Juliet. 
##They exit. 
##The Provost enters, with CLAUDIO (his hands tied), JULIET, and officers.
###CLAUDIO 
Man, why are you parading me like this in front of everyone? Take me off to prison already. 
###PROVOST 
I’m not being cruel. It’s Lord Angelo’s special order. 
###CLAUDIO 
This is how the authorities, like gods, make us pay for our crimes. As the Bible says, God has mercy on those he chooses to have mercy on, and doesn’t have mercy on those he chooses not to, and so on. I suppose that’s fair. 
## LUCIO and two gentlemen re-enter.
###LUCIO 
Claudio! Why are you being arrested? 
###CLAUDIO 
For being too promiscuous, Lucio, too promiscuous. The same way overeating leads to fasting, and overdoing anything leads to being restricted. Like rats gobbling up rat poison, we have a thirst for harmful things, and when we drink them we die. 
###LUCIO 
If I could speak so well while under arrest, I’d ask a few creditors I know to come and lock me up. Though frankly, I’d rather be foolish and free than wise and a prisoner. What’s your crime, Claudio? 
###CLAUDIO 
To speak of it would be another crime. 
###LUCIO 
What, is it murder? 
###CLAUDIO 
No. 
###LUCIO 
Lechery? 
###CLAUDIO 
You could call it that. 
###PROVOST 
Sir, you have to go. 
###CLAUDIO 
(to the Provost) Just a minute, good friend. Lucio, let me have a word with you. 
###LUCIO 
A hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery regulated now? 
###CLAUDIO 
Here’s what happened: I slept with Julietta after we got engaged. You know her—she’s practically my wife, except that we haven’t had an official ceremony. The only reason we didn’t was to increase the amount of the dowry she might receive from her friends and relatives. We thought we’d hide our love until we had a chance to win them over. But it turned out our secret intimacy had an all-too-obvious effect on Juliet. 
###LUCIO 
Pregnant, huh? 
###CLAUDIO 
Unfortunately, yes. And this new deputy of the duke’s—I can’t say whether he’s been blinded by his new power or if he sees the public like a horse to be broken in, so he digs his spurs in right away to show it who’s boss; or if he’s just a bully; or if being a bully is part of the job. But this new governor is taking all these old penalties that, like rusty armor hanging on the wall, haven’t been used in years and is applying them to me. He’s imposing all these unenforced, long-ignored laws on me to make a name for himself. That has to be it, to make his name. 
###LUCIO 
I bet it is; and your head sits so precariously on your shoulders right now that the sigh of a lovesick milkmaid could knock it off. Get in touch with the duke and appeal to him. 
###CLAUDIO 
I tried, but he can’t be found. Please, Lucio, do this favor for me: My sister’s entering a nunnery and starting her training period today. Tell her the danger I’m in, and implore her, in my name, to befriend this strict deputy and try to change his mind. I’ve got a lot of hope in her. Her youthful sweetness alone would move a man. Besides, she has a gift for rhetoric, and she can really persuade people. 
###LUCIO 
I pray she can, for the lives of everyone like you who could now be punished, as well as for your own life, which I’d be sad to see lost so stupidly for playing with you. I’ll go to her. 
###CLAUDIO 
Thank you, Lucio. You’re a good friend. 
###LUCIO 
I’ll be there in two hours. 
###CLAUDIO 
OK, officer, let’s go. 
##All exit.
##A monastery.
## DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS enter.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
No, holy father, forget that idea. Don’t think that Cupid’s feeble arrow can pierce this invulnerable bosom. I want you to shelter me secretly for a reason more ageless and serious than any youthful, burning desire. 
###FRIAR THOMAS 
Can you talk about it? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Reverend sir, no one knows better than you how I’ve always loved the quiet life and never cared much for the social scene where young people brag and throw their money around. I’ve given Lord Angelo, a man of strict self-discipline and self-denial, my absolute power and position here in Vienna. He thinks I’ve gone to Poland, since I’ve spread that rumor among the general public, and everybody believes it. Now, religious sir, do you want to know why I did this? 
###FRIAR THOMAS 
Yes, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I instituted strict statutes and firm laws, necessary controls for headstrong human natures, but for nineteen years I’ve let them grow lax, like an old, fat lion that lies in his cave and never leaves to hunt. Now, a doting father can make a birch whipping rod and wave it in his children’s faces, but if he only threatens and never uses it, eventually they’ll laugh at it and not fear it. Similarly, our regulations have gone unenforced, and so they’re as good as dead. People are flouting the law with their loose living. The proper order of things is turned upside down, as if babies were spanking their nannies. 
###FRIAR THOMAS 
It was in your lordship’s ability to get the justice system working again whenever you wanted. And it would’ve been taken more seriously if you’d done it, rather than Lord Angelo. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Too seriously, I’m afraid. Since it was my fault to give the people so much freedom, I’d seem like a real tyrant now to whip them for things I allowed them to do. We essentially tell people to misbehave when we give evil deeds a pass and don’t punish them. So, friar, I’ve given the job to Angelo. He can effectively deal with this, in my name—but since I’m not personally involved, I won’t look bad. To see how he rules, I’d like to visit him and the people disguised as one of your order’s monks. So please furnish me with a robe and teach me how to behave like a real friar. When there’s more time, I’ll give you additional reasons for my actions. For now, I’ll tell you this one: Lord Angelo is a puritanical man, constantly guarding himself against desire, the type who barely admits blood flows in his veins. So if power changes a person’s principles, we’ll see how he really is. 
##They exit.
##A nunnery.
## ISABELLA and FRANCISCA enter.
###ISABELLA 
And so you nuns have no other privileges? 
###FRANCISCA 
Aren’t these enough? 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, yes. I didn’t mean I wanted more freedom. Actually, I wish there were even more restrictions on the Saint Claire sisterhood. 
###LUCIO 
(offstage) Hello! Peace to this place! 
###ISABELLA 
Who’s that? 
###FRANCISCA 
It’s a man’s voice. Isabella, unlock the door and ask him what he wants. I can’t, but you can, since you haven’t taken your vows yet. Once you have, you’ll only be able to speak with men in the presence of the Mother Superior. Then, if you speak, you mustn’t show your face. Or if you show your face, you mustn’t speak. He’s calling again. Please answer him. 
##She exits.
###ISABELLA 
Peace and prosperity! Who’s there? 
## LUCIO enters.
###LUCIO 
Well, hello, virgin—if you are one, as your rosy cheeks proclaim you to be. Can you help me to find Isabella, a novice here and the pretty sister to Claudio, her unlucky brother? 
###ISABELLA 
Why “her unlucky brother”? I ask, because I’m Isabella, his sister. 
###LUCIO 
Your brother sends you his love, sweet, pretty one. To get right to the point, he’s in prison. 
###ISABELLA 
How awful! For what? 
###LUCIO 
For something which, if you ask me, he should be thanked rather than punished. He’s gotten his lover pregnant. 
###ISABELLA 
Sir, don’t make things up. 
###LUCIO 
It’s true. I admit, I often play the deceiver and joker with young virgins and say things I don’t mean. But because of your religious vocation, I see you as a heavenly, spiritual being, and someone to speak to with sincerely, as I would a saint. 
###ISABELLA 
You mock real saints by calling me one. 
###LUCIO 
Don’t think that. In brief: your brother and his girl have slept together. And the same way your stomach gets full when you eat—and as a bare field, when you plant it, yields a rich harvest—her body shows the results of his plowing. 
###ISABELLA 
He’s made someone pregnant? My cousin Juliet? 
###LUCIO 
Is she your cousin? 
###ISABELLA 
Unofficially, in the silly but sweet way schoolgirls swear to be sisters. 
###LUCIO 
She’s the one. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, let him marry her. 
###LUCIO 
Here’s the problem. The duke has mysteriously left town. He deluded many men—myself included—with the hope of some military action. But now we hear from government insiders that his publicly announced reasons for leaving were far from his real plans. In his place, and with his full authority, Lord Angelo rules. This is a man whose blood is like melted snow, never warmed by uncontrolled lust, but who represses and dulls his natural appetites with exercises for the mind—studying and fasting. To scare folks who are habitually promiscuous and have evaded the law like mice running past a lion, he’s found a severe act that, if taken literally, would cost your brother his life. He’s arrested him under it and plans to make an example of him by strictly applying this law. All hope is gone, unless you can soften Angelo with your pretty prayers. That’s the essence of this errand between you and your poor brother. 
###ISABELLA 
Does he really intend to kill him? 
###LUCIO 
He’s already sentenced him to death, and I hear the provost has the warrant for his execution. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, dear! What can a poor girl like me do to help? 
###LUCIO 
Test the power you have. 
###ISABELLA 
My power? I doubt— 
###LUCIO 
Our doubts work against us and make us lose the good things we often could win by making us scared to try. Go to Lord Angelo, and show him that when girls plead, men give like gods. But when girls cry and kneel, their requests are granted even more freely, as if the girls were asking themselves for permission. 
###ISABELLA 
I’ll see what I can do. 
###LUCIO 
Make it fast. 
###ISABELLA 
I’ll go straightaway, as soon as I give notice of my business to the Mother Superior. Thank you so much. Give my brother my love. I’ll let him know how I made out early this evening. 
###LUCIO 
I’ll go now. 
###ISABELLA 
Goodbye, sir. 
##They exit.
##A hall in ANGELO’s house.
## ANGELO and ESCALUS enter, followed by a justice, the Provost, officers, and other attendants. 
###ANGELO 
We mustn’t let the law turn into a scarecrow—something you set up to scare away birds of prey but then never change, until the birds get so used to it that they sit on it rather than fear it. 
###ESCALUS 
Yes, but we should also be precise. Better to use a scalpel than a hatchet, cutting carefully instead of chopping to death. This gentleman whose life I’d like to save had such a noble father. I know you’re a completely disciplined, virtuous man. But imagine you felt sexual stirrings for a woman, and you were in the right place at the right time, and by acting on that desire you could have her. If sometime in your life, you’d made the same mistake for which you now condemn him, you’d have brought the law down on yourself. 
###ANGELO 
It’s one thing to be tempted, Escalus, but another thing to give in. I don’t deny that the twelve members of a jury might include a thief or two who are far guiltier than the prisoner they’re passing sentence on. But justice takes the opportunities it has; who knows what laws thieves pass against other thieves? Obviously, if we stumble across a jewel in the road, we’ll bend down and take it, because we see it. But things we don’t see, we step over and never think about. You can’t excuse his crime on the grounds that I could have done the same thing. Instead, if I—the man who’s condemning him—commit the same offense, let this verdict of mine act as a precedent for my death, and let no allowances be made for me. Sir, he must die. 
###ESCALUS 
As you command. 
###ANGELO 
Where is the provost? 
###PROVOST 
Here, sir. 
###ANGELO 
See that Claudio is executed by nine tomorrow morning. Give him a priest to confess to, and let him prepare himself for death, for this is his journey’s end. 
##The Provost exits.
###ESCALUS 
(to himself) Well, heaven forgive him—and forgive us all! Some people succeed by sinning, and some are brought down by virtue. Some people run from dubious situations and so never suffer punishment, and some people get punished for a single mistake. 
## ELBOW and officers holding FROTH and POMPEY enter.
###ELBOW 
Bring them this way. If these aren’t the kind of people who do nothing but dirty things in whorehouses, then I don’t know the law. Bring them this way. 
###ANGELO 
Well, sir! What’s your name? And what’s the matter? 
###ELBOW 
If it pleases your honor, I am the duke’s poor police officer, and my name is Elbow. I rely on the law, sir, and bring in here before you two notorious benefactors (confusing the word benefactor with malefactor). 
###ANGELO 
Benefactors? What benefactors are they? Aren’t they malefactors? 
###ELBOW 
If it pleases your honor, I don’t really know what they are. But they’re definitely scoundrels, that I’m sure of, and lacking the universal piety that all good Christians ought to have. 
###ESCALUS 
(to Angelo, sarcastically) He’s a good talker, and a real smart cop. 
###ANGELO 
Out with it. What’s their rank? Your name’s Elbow? Why don’t you speak, Elbow? 
###POMPEY 
He can’t, sir. He’s been pushed out of the way. 
###ANGELO 
(to Pompey) What do you do, sir? 
###ELBOW 
Him, sir! He’s a bartender, sir, and a part-time pimp, one who works for a madam. Her brothel in the suburbs, sir, was, as they say, torn down, and now she claims to run a bathhouse, and I think that’s a bad house too. 
###ESCALUS 
How do you know that? 
###ELBOW 
My wife sir, whom I detest with heaven and your honor as my witnesses— 
###ESCALUS 
What, you detest your wife? 
###ELBOW 
Yes, sir, whom, I thank heaven, is a morally upright woman— 
###ESCALUS 
That’s why you detest her? 
###ELBOW 
I say, sir, I’ll detest myself as well as her, if this house, if it’s not a whorehouse, it’s a great pity, for it’s an immoral place. 
###ESCALUS 
How do you know that? 
###ELBOW 
From my wife, who, if she had been a woman given to sin, might have been accused of fornication, adultery, and all sorts of dirty things there. 
###ESCALUS 
Because of the actions of the madam of the whorehouse? 
###ELBOW 
Yes, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s doing. But my wife spit in this man’s face, defying him. 
###POMPEY 
Please, sir, this is not true. 
###ELBOW 
Prove it before these rogues here, you honorable man. Prove it. 
###ESCALUS 
(to Angelo) Do you hear how he mixes up his words? 
###POMPEY 
Sir, this very pregnant woman came in, longing—I beg your honor’s pardon—for stewed prunes. Sir, we had only two in the house, which at that very time were sitting, it so happened, in a fruit dish, a three-cent dish. Your honors have seen such dishes; they’re not fine china, but they’re very good dishes— 
###ESCALUS 
Get on with it. Never mind about the dish, sir. 
###POMPEY 
No, sir, you’re right. It’s not worth a pin, but back to the point. As I was saying, this Mrs. Elbow, was, as I say, very pregnant, and longing, as I said, for prunes. We had only two left in the dish, as I said, and this very man, Mr. Froth here, having eaten the rest and paid for them very generously. Because as you know, Mr. Froth, I couldn’t give you three cents’ change. 
###FROTH 
No, indeed. 
###POMPEY 
Very well. If you remember, you were talking about the previously mentioned prunes— 
###FROTH 
Right, I was. 
###POMPEY 
Ok, and I was telling you, if you remember, that so-and-so couldn’t be cured of you-know-what, unless they kept to a strict diet— 
###FROTH 
All this is true. 
###POMPEY 
Why, very well, then— 
###ESCALUS 
You’re a tedious fool. Get to the point. What was done to Elbow’s wife that gave him a reason to complain? Come and get to what was done to her. 
###POMPEY 
Sir, your honor can’t get to that yet. 
###ESCALUS 
That’s not what I meant, sir. 
###POMPEY 
But you will get it, sir, if your honor pleases. And, I beg you, look at Mr. Froth here, sir; a man who makes only 80 pounds a year and whose his father died, leaving him an inheritance, on All Saints’ Day—wasn’t it All Saints’ Day, Mr. Froth? 
###FROTH 
Halloween. 
###POMPEY 
Very well. I hope we’ll get to the truth here. He, sir, was sitting, as I say, in a reclining chair, sir. It was at the Bunch of Grapes tavern, where you like to sit and relax, don’t you? 
###FROTH 
I do, because the room has a big open fire, good in winter. 
###POMPEY 
Why, very well, then. I hope we’ll get to the truth here. 
###ANGELO 
This could last as long as a night in Russia, during the time of year when nights are longest. I’m leaving. I’ll leave you to get to the bottom of this case, hoping you’ll find reasons to whip them all. 
###ESCALUS 
I think I will. Good-bye, your lordship. 
## ANGELO exits.
Now, sir, come on: what happened to Elbow’s wife, once more? 
###POMPEY 
Once, sir? Nothing happened to her once. 
###ELBOW 
I beg you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife. 
###POMPEY 
I beg your honor, ask me. 
###ESCALUS 
Well, sir; what did this gentleman do to her? 
###POMPEY 
I beg you, sir, look at this gentleman’s face. Good Mr. Froth, look at his honor—it’s for a good reason. Does your honor see his face? 
###ESCALUS 
Yes, sir, very well. 
###POMPEY 
No, I beg you, really study it. 
###ESCALUS 
Well, I am. 
###POMPEY 
Does your honor see any harm in his face? 
###ESCALUS 
Why, no. 
###POMPEY 
I’ll swear upon a bible, his face is the worst thing about him (confusing supposed for deposed). And if his face is the worst thing about him, how could Mr. Froth do the officer’s wife any harm? I’d like your honor to explain that. 
###ESCALUS 
He’s right. Officer, what do you say to that? 
###ELBOW 
(confusing respected for suspected throughout) First, if it pleases you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his employer a respected woman. 
###POMPEY 
I swear, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us. 
###ELBOW 
Scoundrel, you lie. You lie, wicked scoundrel! The time has yet to come that she was ever respected by man, woman, or child. 
###POMPEY 
Sir, he respected her before he married her. 
###ESCALUS 
Who’s smarter here? The representative of justice or the representative of sin? Is this true? 
###ELBOW 
Oh, you wretch! Oh, you scoundrel! Oh, you cannibal! I respected her before I was married to her! If I ever respected her, or she respected me, I’m not the duke’s poor officer. Prove this, you wicked cannibal, or I’ll sue you for assault. 
###ESCALUS 
If he boxed your ears, you could sue him for slander, too. 
###ELBOW 
Thank you, your worship. What would you like me to do with this wicked wretch? 
###ESCALUS 
Honestly, officer, because he’s committed some crime that you would expose if you were capable, let him keep on until you figure out what it is. 
###ELBOW 
Thank you, your worship. Now, you wicked wretch, you see what’s going to happen to you: you’re to be kept on; they’re keeping you on. 
###ESCALUS 
Where were you born, friend? 
###FROTH 
Here in Vienna, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
Do you have an income of 80 pounds a year? 
###FROTH 
Yes, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
All right. What do you do, sir? 
###POMPHEY 
Bartender; a poor widow’s bartender. 
###ESCALUS 
Your employer’s name? 
###POMPHEY 
Mistress Overdone. 
###ESCALUS 
Has she had more than one husband? 
###POMPEY 
Nine, sir. She got the name Overdone from the last one. 
###ESCALUS 
Nine! Come here, Mr. Froth. Mr. Froth, I’d prefer you not associate with bartenders. They’ll draw you dry, Mr. Froth, and you’ll get them hanged. Get out, and don’t let me hear of you again. 
###FROTH 
Thank you, your worship. Personally, I never go into bars, unless I’m drawn in. 
###ESCALUS 
Well, not anymore, Mr. Froth. Goodbye. 
## FROTH exits.
Come here, Mr. Bartender. What’s your name, Mr. Bartender? 
###POMPEY 
Pompey. 
###ESCALUS 
What else? 
###POMPEY 
Ass, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
Yes, and your ass is the biggest thing about you, so in the crudest sense you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, you’re a part-time pimp, however much you hide it by bartending, aren’t you? Come on, it’ll be better for you if you tell me the truth. 
###POMPEY 
Honestly, sir, I’m a poor man just trying to earn a living. 
###ESCALUS 
How would you live, Pompey? By being a pimp? What do you think of that profession, Pompey? Is it a legal profession? 
###POMPEY 
If the law allowed it, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor will it be allowed in Vienna. 
###POMPEY 
Does your worship mean to castrate and spay all the young men and women in town? 
###ESCALUS 
No, Pompey. 
###POMPEY 
Then, sir, in my poor opinion, they’ll get it on. If your worship would make arrangements for the whores and their clients, you wouldn’t need to fear the pimps. 
###ESCALUS 
I can tell you, we’re introducing some strong penalties— specifically, beheading and hanging. 
###POMPEY 
If you behead and hang everyone who breaks the law by having sex, in just ten years you’ll have to commission people to repopulate the city. If this law lasts a decade in Vienna, I’ll rent the best house in town at three cents a square foot. If you’re alive to see this, say Pompey told you so. 
###ESCALUS 
Thank you, Pompey, and, in return for your prediction, listen carefully. I advise you, don’t let me find you appearing before me again upon any complaint whatsoever, not even for living where you do. If I do, I’ll beat you like Julius Caesar did to your namesake—Pompey—and send you scurrying to your tent in defeat. To put it plainly, Pompey, I will have you whipped. So, for now, Pompey, goodbye. 
###POMPEY 
I thank your worship for your good advice. 
##(to himself) 
But I shall follow it only as my body and my opportunities dictate. Whip me? No, no; let a cart driver whip his old nag. A brave heart isn’t whipped out of his job. 
##He exits.
###ESCALUS 
Come here, Mr. Elbow; come here, Mr. Policeman. How long have you been a policeman? 
###ELBOW 
Seven and a half years, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
I thought you’d been at the job for a while, given your skill at it. You say seven years altogether? 
###ELBOW 
And a half, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
Oh, that’s so hard on you. It’s wrong that you have to work so much. Aren’t there enough capable men in your precinct? 
###ELBOW 
Honestly, sir, few who are bright enough. They’re happy to have me substitute for them. They pay me a little money, and I handle all the duties. 
###ESCALUS 
Please bring me some six or seven names, the most competent people in your parish. 
###ELBOW 
To your worship’s house, sir? 
###ESCALUS 
To my house. Goodbye. 
## ELBOW exits.
What time is it? 
###JUSTICE 
Eleven, sir. 
###ESCALUS 
Please, come home to lunch with me. 
###JUSTICE 
I’m most grateful. Thank you. 
###ESCALUS 
Claudio’s death saddens me, but there’s no way to prevent it. 
###JUSTICE 
Lord Angelo is severe. 
###ESCALUS 
It’s unfortunately necessary. Mercy isn’t often what it seems, since pardoning a crime can lead to additional pain. Even so—poor Claudio! There’s no way to prevent it. Let’s go, sir. 
##They exit.
##Another room in ANGELO’s house.
##The Provost and a servant enter.
###SERVANT 
He’s listening to a case. He’ll come at once, when I tell him you’re here. 
###PROVOST 
Please do. 
##The Servant exits.
I’ll ask him his intentions; maybe he’ll relent. Claudio didn’t consciously commit a crime. People of every class and age indulge in this vice—and he’s going to die for it! 
## ANGELO enters.
###ANGELO 
Now, what’s the matter, Provost? 
###PROVOST 
Do you want Claudio to die tomorrow? 
###ANGELO 
Did I not tell you yes? Don’t you have your orders? Why do you ask again? 
###PROVOST 
In case I might be too rash. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’ve seen judges regret imposing the death sentence after the execution. 
###ANGELO 
Enough—that’s my problem. Do your job, or resign your position. We can easily do without you. 
###PROVOST 
I beg your honor’s pardon. What should we do, sir, with Juliet? She’s in labor, very close to giving birth. 
###ANGELO 
Make arrangements to get her to a more appropriate place, and do it quickly. 
##The Servant re-enters.
###SERVANT 
The condemned man’s sister is here and wants to speak to you. 
###ANGELO 
He has a sister? 
###PROVOST 
Yes, my good lord—a very virtuous girl who’s entering a convent, if she hasn’t already. 
###ANGELO 
Well, bring her in. 
##The Servant exits.
See that the tramp Juliet is moved, and provide her with everything she needs, but nothing extravagant. I’ll authorize it. 
## ISABELLA and LUCIO enter.
###PROVOST 
(departing) God save your honor! 
###ANGELO 
Don’t leave yet. 
##(to ISABELLA)
Welcome. What do you want? 
###ISABELLA 
I sadly beg a request of your honor. Please hear me, your honor. 
###ANGELO 
Well, what’s your request? 
###ISABELLA 
There’s a certain vice that I hate, and would love to see struck down by law. I’d rather not plead for it, but I must. I shouldn’t plead for it, but I’m torn between wanting and not wanting to. 
###ANGELO 
Well, what’s the matter? 
###ISABELLA 
I have a brother who’s condemned to death. I beg you, condemn his crime but not him. 
###PROVOST 
(to himself) Heaven give you the power to persuade him! 
###ANGELO 
Condemn the crime and not the person who commits it? Why, by definition every crime is condemned before it’s committed. I would have a meaningless role if I just punished the crimes whose penalties were in the law books and let the criminal go. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, fair but harsh law! Then I had a brother but don’t anymore. (departing) Heaven protect your honor! 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) Don’t give up so fast. Go to him again, beg him, kneel down before him, cling to his gown. You’re too cold. You couldn’t be more casual if you were asking him for a pin. Go to him. 
###ISABELLA 
Does he have to die? 
###ANGELO 
Miss, there’s no way out. 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, there is. I think that you could pardon him, and no one on heaven or earth would be sorry. 
###ANGELO 
I won’t do it. 
###ISABELLA 
But could you, if you wanted to? 
###ANGELO 
Look, what I won’t do, I can’t do. 
###ISABELLA 
But might you do it, without harming the world, if your heart felt as compassionate toward him as mine does? 
###ANGELO 
He’s sentenced; it’s too late. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) You’re too cold. 
###ISABELLA 
Too late? why, no—I can speak a word and then take it back. Believe this: no symbol of authority—not the king’s crown, or the deputy’s sword, or the military officer’s baton, or the judge’s robe—makes a person great as much as mercy does. If he’d been you and you’d been him, you would have slipped like he did; but he, in your place, wouldn’t have been so stern. 
###ANGELO 
Please leave. 
###ISABELLA 
I wish to heaven I had your power, and you were Isabel! Would things be like this? No, I’d decide what it is to be a judge, and to be a prisoner. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) Yes, that’s the way to talk. 
###ANGELO 
Your brother is doomed for breaking the law. You’re wasting your breath. 
###ISABELLA 
How sad! Why, all the souls on earth were doomed once upon a time. And God, who might have seized the chance to condemn us, instead found a way to redeem our sins. What would happen to you, if he who is the highest judge of all should judge you as you are now? Oh, think about that, and then merciful speech will flow out your mouth, as if you had been reborn. 
###ANGELO 
Accept it, lovely lady. It’s the law, not I, that condemns your brother. Were he my cousin, brother, or my son, it’d be the same. He must die tomorrow. 
###ISABELLA 
Tomorrow! Oh, that’s so sudden! Spare him, spare him! He’s not prepared for death. We only kill fowl in season, when they’re in the best shape for eating. Should we serve him up to heaven with less respect than we show toward our inferior mortal bodies? My good, good lord, consider: who else has died for this crime? Many people have committed it. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) Yes, well said. 
###ANGELO 
The law wasn’t dead, but it was asleep. All those people wouldn’t have dared to commit that crime if the first lawbreaker had been punished. Now the law’s awake, notes what’s going on, and, like a fortuneteller, looks in a crystal ball to see what future evils, either newly conceived or just being contemplated, will someday hatch. Now, they won’t develop any further but will die before they’re born. 
###ISABELLA 
Show some pity. 
###ANGELO 
I show it most of all when I show justice, for then I pity all those people I don’t know who’d be harmed by an unpunished crime. I do right to the man who, by paying for one wrong act, doesn’t live to commit another one. Be satisfied with this. Your brother dies tomorrow. Accept it. 
###ISABELLA 
So you must be the first one to impose this sentence, and he the first one to suffer it. Oh, it’s excellent to have a giant’s strength, but it’s tyranny to use it like a giant. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) That’s well said. 
###ISABELLA 
If men of power could thunder and wield lightning as the god Jove himself does, Jove would never have any peace, for every puny, petty official would use his heaven for thunder, nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven, you use your sharp, sulfur-scented lightning bolts to split the hard gnarled oak tree, rather than the soft myrtle bush. But give a proud man a little bit of temporary authority and he forgets what it means to be made in God’s image. Instead, like an angry ape that mimics people’s behavior, he does such incredibly grotesque things before high heaven that the angels, if they were human, would either weep or die laughing. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) Oh, keep at him, keep at him, girl! He’s going to relent. He’s coming around, I can tell. 
###PROVOST 
(to himself) Pray heaven she wins him over! 
###ISABELLA 
We can’t use ourselves as a standard to judge others. Great men may joke about the saints; that’s good fun. But if an ordinary person does it, it’s profane. 
###LUCIO 
You’re right, girl. Keep talking like that. 
###ISABELLA 
When a captain curses, it’s just angry words. When a private does it, it’s blasphemy. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) You know about that sort of stuff? Tell us more. 
###ANGELO 
Why are you attacking me with these sayings? 
###ISABELLA 
Because people in authority, even though they sin like everyone else, apply a sort of bandage to cover—but not cure—their sinful sores. Look in your heart and ask yourself if you’ve ever experienced anything like my brother’s crime. If your heart admits to being guilty of the same natural impulses, don’t say a word to condemn my brother. 
###ANGELO 
(to himself) She speaks with such sense, she’s got my senses and desire stirred up. Goodbye. 
###ISABELLA 
My gracious lord, come back. 
###ANGELO 
I’ll consider the matter. Come again tomorrow. 
###ISABELLA 
I’ll bribe you—come back, my good lord. 
###ANGELO 
What? Bribe me? 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, with gifts from heaven. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) You nearly blew it. 
###ISABELLA 
Not with silly coins of real gold, or jewels whose value rises and falls, depending on fashion; but with constant prayers that will rise up and enter heaven before dawn—the prayers of protected souls, nuns whose minds are dedicated only to spiritual things. 
###ANGELO 
Well, come see me tomorrow. 
###LUCIO 
(aside to ISABELLA) Great, that’s enough. Let’s go! 
###ISABELLA 
Heaven keep your honor safe! 
###ANGELO 
(to himself) Amen—for I’m falling into temptation, where desires and prayers work against each other. 
###ISABELLA 
What time tomorrow should I come to your lordship? 
###ANGELO 
Anytime before noon. 
###ISABELLA 
God save your honor! 
## ISABELLA, LUCIO, and the Provost exit.
###ANGELO 
From you, and from your virtue, too! What’s happening? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter or the tempted, who sins the most? Ha! It’s not her, she’s not trying to be a tempter. It’s me. It’s like I’m lying in a field of violets, only instead of blossoming and smelling like a flower, I’m rotting and stinking like a corpse from the same sun that makes the flowers grow. Is it possible that a modest woman can arouse desire more than a seductive one? Having destroyed enough land already, should a person want to tear down a holy place and establish evil there as well? Oh, damn, damn, damn! Angelo, what are you doing, who are you? Do you sinfully desire her for the things that make her good? Oh, I should let her brother live! Thieves are justified in robbing when the judges themselves are thieves. Can it be I’m in love with her, when I want to hear her speak again, and gaze into her eyes? What am I dreaming of? Oh, the devil’s a cunning enemy—to catch a saint, he baits the hook with saints! The most dangerous temptation is the one that uses our love of goodness to draw us into sin. A prostitute could never attract me, even with her two powers: her seductive skills and her natural endowments. But this virtuous girl totally overwhelms me. Whenever I saw men who were infatuated like idiots, I smiled and didn’t understand—up until now. 
##He exits.
##A room in a prison.
## DUKE VINCENTIO, disguised as a friar, and the Provost enter from opposite directions.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Hello, Provost—I think that’s who you are. 
###PROVOST 
I am the provost. What do you want, good friar? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
My sense of charity and my religious order make it my duty to come visit the troubled souls here in prison. Grant me the clergy’s usual right to see them, and tell me the nature of their crimes, so I may minister to them accordingly. 
###PROVOST 
I’d do more than that, if it were needed. 
## JULIET enters.
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman in my charge who, by giving in to her youthful passion, has ruined her reputation. She’s pregnant, and the child’s father is sentenced to death. He’s just a young man, who deserves the chance to make more babies, rather than to die for this one. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
When must he die? 
###PROVOST 
Tomorrow, I think. 
##(to JULIET)
I’ve gotten accommodations for you. Wait here, and you’ll be escorted to them. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Pretty one, do you repent the sin you’re carrying? 
###JULIET 
I do, and patiently bear the shame. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I’ll teach you how to examine your conscience, and to test if your repentance is real or insincere. 
###JULIET 
I’ll gladly learn. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Do you love the man who wronged you? 
###JULIET 
Yes, as I love myself, the woman who wronged him. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
So then it seems your sinful act was mutually committed? 
###JULIET 
Mutually. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
But your sin is heavier than his. 
###JULIET 
I do confess it, and repent it, father. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s appropriate, daughter. But if you’re only sorry because your sin’s been found out, that’s being sorry for yourself, not for offending Heaven. We tend to repent out of fear of God, rather than love for him— 
###JULIET 
I repent because my act was evil. I’m happy to be ashamed of it. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Maintain that attitude. I hear your partner must die tomorrow, and I’m going to give him spiritual guidance. Grace go with you, and God bless you! 
##He exits.
###JULIET 
Must die tomorrow! Oh, painful love! By making me pregnant, it’s spared my life. But that comfort means I have to live with the horror of Claudio’s death. 
###PROVOST 
He’s to be pitied. 
##They exit.
##A room in ANGELO’s house.
## ANGELO enters.
###ANGELO 
When I try to pray and think, I think and pray about different things. My empty words focus on heaven, while my imagination ignores what I’m saying and fixates on Isabel. It’s as if I’m only mouthing God’s name, while an evil idea grows in my heart. The politics I used to study with such interest now seem dry and tedious. The dignity I was so proud of (I hope no one hears this) is now worth even less than some silly hat feather waving uselessly in the wind. Oh, how often do rank and ceremonial trappings impress the foolish and entrap even the wise! Passions are passions—they cannot simply be swept away. You can write “good angel” on the devil’s horns, but that doesn’t change his devilish nature. 
##A Servant enters.
Hello! Who’s there? 
###SERVANT 
One Isabel, a nun, wishes to see you. 
###ANGELO 
Show her the way. 
##The Servant exits.
Oh, heavens! Why does my blood rush to my heart, both choking it and making the rest of my body weak? It’s like a stupid crowd surrounding somebody who faints—they’re all trying to help him and actually they’re cutting off the air he needs. Or, like the common people who drop what they’re doing and rush over to see their beloved king when he appears, fawning and crowding him so much that their ignorant adoration becomes offensive. 
## ISABELLA enters.
How are you, pretty lady? 
###ISABELLA 
I’ve come to find out what you want to do. 
###ANGELO 
If only you knew what I want to do and didn’t have to ask. Your brother cannot live. 
###ISABELLA 
Very well, then. Heaven keep your honor! 
###ANGELO 
On the other hand, he may live awhile—maybe as long as you or me. Still, he must die. 
###ISABELLA 
By your command? 
###ANGELO 
Yes. 
###ISABELLA 
I beg you, tell me when. So that, no matter how long or short his reprieve is, he’ll be spiritually prepared and can save his soul. 
###ANGELO 
Ha! Damn these filthy vices! One might as well pardon a murderer as forgive a fornicator who begets an illegitimate child. It’s as easy to take a legitimate life as it is to create an illegitimate one. 
###ISABELLA 
Heaven may regard the two sins as equal, but humans do not. 
###ANGELO 
You think so? Then I’ll put this question to you: which would you prefer, that this very fair law took your brother’s life, or to save your brother, you give up your body to the same sort of sweet sin as did the girl he ruined? 
###ISABELLA 
Sir, believe this, I’d rather give up my body than my soul. 
###ANGELO 
I’m not talking about your soul: sins we’re compelled to commit get counted, but they don’t count against us. 
###ISABELLA 
What are you saying? 
###ANGELO 
No, don’t hold me to that, for I can argue a point I don’t really believe. Answer this. As the voice of the written law, I pronounce a death sentence on your brother’s life. Might it not be charity to commit a sin to save this brother’s life? 
###ISABELLA 
If you want to do it, I’ll risk the punishment on my soul, and say it’d be no sin at all, but charity. 
###ANGELO 
If you felt like doing it, even at the risk of your soul, sin and charity would balance each other perfectly. 
###ISABELLA 
If begging for his life is a sin, Heaven let me bear it! If your granting my request is a sin, I’ll pray each morning to have it added to my faults and not one you have to answer for. 
###ANGELO 
No, listen to me. You’re not following me. Either you’re dumb or you’re playing dumb, and that’s not good. 
###ISABELLA 
Call me dumb, then, and not very good. Let me accept by God’s grace that I’m not any better than that. 
###ANGELO 
This is how smart people try to seem really bright: by knocking their own intelligence. It’s the same way hiding behind a black mask makes a woman seem ten times more beautiful than her naked face does. But pay attention. I’ll be more blunt, so that you get it. Your brother is to die. 
###ISABELLA 
Yes. 
###ANGELO 
That’s the penalty for his crime, under the law. 
###ISABELLA 
True. 
###ANGELO 
Suppose that there was no other way to save his life—not that I’m admitting this, it’s just for the sake of argument—let’s say that you, his sister, were desired by someone whose influence with the judge, or whose own powerful position, could rescue your brother from the law’s binding chains. And there was no other earthly way to save him, unless you gave your virginity to this hypothetical man, or else your brother dies. What would you do? 
###ISABELLA 
I would do this as much for my poor brother as myself—that is, if I were under a death sentence, I’d strip myself naked and display the whip’s bloody lashes like rubies. And I’d go to my death like going to my bed, before I’d surrender my body to sin. 
###ANGELO 
Then your brother must die. 
###ISABELLA 
And that’s the better bargain. Better a brother die once than a sister suffer eternal damnation to save him. 
###ANGELO 
Then aren’t you as cruel as the sentence you’ve so deplored? 
###ISABELLA 
A shameful release and an unconditional pardon are two different things. Legal mercy is in no way related to an immoral rescue. 
###ANGELO 
You said a little while ago the law was tyrannical, arguing that your brother’s sinning was a lighthearted act, not a vice. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, forgive me, my lord. To get what we want, we often say things we don’t mean. I’ve made excuses for something I hate in order to help the brother I love. 
###ANGELO 
We’re all weak. 
###ISABELLA 
Yes. Otherwise, my brother would deserve to die, if he were the only person to have inherited this weakness. 
###ANGELO 
No, women are weak too. 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, as weak their mirrors, which break as easily as they reflect images. Women—Heaven help us!—are ruined by men who take advantage of us. Call us frail ten times over, for we’re as soft as our skin, and gullible. 
###ANGELO 
I agree. And based on what you say about your sex—since I suppose we’re only as strong as our own weakest points—let me be bold. I take you at your word. Be what you are—a woman, that is. If you are better than that, then you’re not a woman. But if you are one, as you certainly seem to be by all outward appearances, show it now by being weak. 
###ISABELLA 
I can only speak with a sincere tongue. My gentle lord, please talk plainly, as you did before. 
###ANGELO 
To put it plainly, I love you. 
###ISABELLA 
My brother loved Juliet, and you tell me that he’ll die for it. 
###ANGELO 
He won’t, Isabel, if you give me love. 
###ISABELLA 
I know your virtue gives you the freedom to act wicked, in order to test others. 
###ANGELO 
Believe me, I swear I mean what I say. 
###ISABELLA 
What! To believe so much in someone with so little honor and such evil intentions! You deceiver! I’ll denounce you, Angelo, believe me. Sign a pardon for my brother immediately, or I’ll scream to the entire world what sort of man you are. 
###ANGELO 
Who will believe you, Isabel? My spotless reputation, my strict way of living, my testimony against you, and my position will all outweigh your accusation. You’ll be silenced and discredited, accused of slander. The starting gate is open now, and my desires are off and running. Feed my hunger—no more of your modesty and time-wasting blushes, which charm me and then banish me for being charmed. Save your brother by sleeping with me, or he’ll be put to death. And not only that, but it’ll be death by torture, drawn out by your cruelty. Accept my offer tomorrow, or by my almighty passion, I’ll tyrannize him. As for you, say what you want. My lie, which calls your claim false, will outweigh your true claim. 
##He exits.
###ISABELLA 
Who can I complain to? If I reported this, who would believe me? Oh, dangerous mouths, with double-talking tongues that can both condemn and approve, and make the law bow to their wishes. They put their sexual desires before notions of right and wrong! I’ll go to my brother. Although he gave in to his body’s demands, his mind’s so honorable that, if he had twenty heads to lay on twenty bloody execution blocks, he’d give them all up, rather than let his sister pollute her body. So, Isabel, you’ll live chaste, and brother, you’ll die. My chastity is more important than my brother. I’ll tell him of Angelo’s request, and prepare him for death—and the eternal rest of his soul. 
##She exits.
##A room in the prison.
## DUKE VINCENTIO, disguised as before, enters with CLAUDIO and the Provost. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
So, you hope for a pardon from Lord Angelo? 
###CLAUDIO 
Hope is the only medicine miserable people have. I hope to live, and am prepared to die. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Be ready to die; then either death or life will be all the sweeter. Tell life this: if I lose you, I lose something that only fools would want to keep. You’re just a breath, subject to all the changes of weather that hourly buffet the body you occupy. You’re simply death’s dupe, constantly struggling to run away from him, while all the while you’re running toward him. You’re not noble, because all your civilized comforts come from lowly plants and animals. You’re by no means brave, because the forked tongue of a little snake scares you. Sleep is your best way to rest, and you do that a lot, yet you stupidly fear death, which is basically the same thing. You’re not a single being, because you’re composed of thousands of grains of dust. You’re not happy, because you’re always trying to get what you don’t have, and what you do have, you forget about. You’re unstable, your moods changing as often as the phases of the moon. If you’re rich, you’re actually poor—like an ass staggering under a load of gold bars, you’re just carrying your heavy wealth for a period, and you lose that wealth when you die. You don’t have any friends, for even your children—the offspring of your own loins—curse the gout, skin rashes, and colds for not carrying you off sooner. You’re neither old or young, but always suspended in a sort of mid-afternoon nap, because when young, you’re like an old beggar, wheedling money from your feeble elders. And when you’re old and rich yourself, you have neither the passion, love, agility, or beauty to enjoy your wealth. So, what in all this is worth living for? Life hides more than a thousand deaths. Yet it’s death, which fixes all these problems, that we fear. 
###CLAUDIO 
I humbly thank you. In looking to live, I find I actually seek to die, and by seeking death, I find life. Let death come. 
###ISABELLA 
(offstage) Hello, there! Peace, grace, and good company to everyone here! 
###PROVOST 
Who’s there? Come in. That wish deserves a welcome. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Dear sir, I’ll visit you again soon. 
###CLAUDIO 
Most holy sir, thank you. 
## ISABELLA enters.
###ISABELLA 
My business is a word or two with Claudio. 
###PROVOST 
And very welcome. Look, signor, here’s your sister. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Provost, a word with you. 
###PROVOST 
As many as you please. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Take me to a place where I can hide and overhear them. 
## DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost conceal themselves.
###CLAUDIO 
Now, sister, what’s the good word? 
###ISABELLA 
Why, as all good words are—very good indeed. Lord Angelo has business with heaven, and he’s going to make you his ambassador there—an eternal appointment. So get ready, quickly. Tomorrow you set off. 
###CLAUDIO 
Is there no way out? 
###ISABELLA 
None, except a way that would save his head by breaking my heart in two. 
###CLAUDIO 
But is there any? 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, brother, you can live. If you beg him, the judge will offer a devilish sort of mercy that will free you, yet chain you until death. 
###CLAUDIO 
Lifetime imprisonment? 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, exactly. A type of lifetime imprisonment that would limit your movements, even if you had the freedom to roam the entire world. 
###CLAUDIO 
But what type? 
###ISABELLA 
The type that, if you agreed to it, would strip your honor from your body like bark from a tree trunk, and leave you exposed to shame. 
###CLAUDIO 
Get to the point. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, I’m afraid of you, Claudio. I tremble to think you would cherish a wild existence and would value six or seven years of life more than everlasting honor. Do you dare to die? The worst part of death is anticipating it. A beetle we step on suffers as much as a giant when it dies. 
###CLAUDIO 
Why are you shaming me like this? Do you think I can summon my resolve from flowery, comforting speeches? If I have to die, I will meet the darkness like a bride, and hug it in my arms. 
###ISABELLA 
Now, that’s my brother talking—like my father speaking from his grave. Yes, you must die. You’re too noble to save yourself in a shameful way. This seemingly saintly deputy, whose composed face and carefully calculated words target and attack young people like some bird of prey, is really a devil. If you drained him of all the filth inside him, you’d reveal a pond as deep as hell. 
###CLAUDIO 
The “priestly” Angelo! 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, it’s a cunning disguise from hell, to cloak and cover the wickedest people in priestly clothes. Can you believe it, Claudio? If I gave him my virginity, you’d be freed. 
###CLAUDIO 
Oh, heavens! It can’t be. 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, in exchange for this awful sin, he’d free you to keep on sinning. Tonight’s the time I have to do something I hate to even pronounce, or else you die tomorrow. 
###CLAUDIO 
You mustn’t do it. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, if it were just my life, I’d throw it away like a pin to save you. 
###CLAUDIO 
Thanks, dear Isabel. 
###ISABELLA 
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow. 
###CLAUDIO 
Yes. Is his lust so great that it causes him to make a mockery of the law, even while he’s enforcing it? Of course, it isn’t a sin, or anyway it’s the least of the seven deadly sins. 
###ISABELLA 
Which is the least? 
###CLAUDIO 
If it were a damnable thing, why—if he’s so wise—would he risk being eternally punished for a momentary pleasure? Oh, Isabel! 
###ISABELLA 
What are you saying? 
###CLAUDIO 
Death is a fearful thing. 
###ISABELLA 
And a disgraced life a hateful one. 
###CLAUDIO 
Yes, but to die, and go who knows where. To lie cold and congealing, and to rot—this conscious, warm body to become a compact lump of earth, and the vast spirit to swim in hell’s fiery floods or reside in a frigid land of thick ice. To be confined inside invisible winds and perpetually, violently blown all around the world hanging in space. Or to be worse off than one of those tortured souls howling from punishment of sinful thoughts—it’s too horrible! The weariest, most hateful life that old age, aches, poverty and imprisonment can inflict on us is paradise compared to our fears of death. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, no! 
###CLAUDIO 
Sweet sister, let me live. Any sin you commit to save a brother’s life, nature will pardon as though it were a good deed. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, you beast! Treacherous coward! Shameful wretch! Will you be given your life as a result of my vice? Isn’t it a kind of incest, to gain life from your own sister’s shame? What should I think? God forbid, my mother must have cheated on my father, for such a twisted son as you never could have sprung from his blood! I renounce you—die, perish! Even if all I had to do was pray on bended knees to stop your execution, I’d let it happen. I’ll pray a thousand prayers for your death, and not one word to save you. 
###CLAUDIO 
No, listen to me, Isabel. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, shame, shame, shame! Your sin was no one-time accident, but a habit. Granting you mercy would be like pimping, enabling you to do it again. It’s best that you die right away. 
###CLAUDIO 
Oh, listen to me, Isabella! 
## DUKE VINCENTIO re-enters, from his hiding place.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Permit me to say a word, young sister, just one word. 
###ISABELLA 
What do you want? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
If you can spare the time, I’d like to talk with you in a little while. You’d be doing yourself a favor as well as me. 
###ISABELLA 
I don’t have any spare time, but I’ll wait for you a little while. 
##She moves off. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Son, I overheard what happened between you and your sister. Angelo never meant to seduce her. He was only testing her virtue, to test his ability to judge character. Being a person of integrity, she virtuously refused him, and he was happy to hear it. I’m Angelo’s confessor, so I know this is true. Therefore, prepare yourself for death. Don’t prop yourself up with false hopes. Tomorrow you must die. Fall to your knees and prepare for confession. 
###CLAUDIO 
Let me ask my sister to forgive me. I’m so out of love with life that I’ll pray to be rid of it. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Maintain that attitude. Farewell. 
## CLAUDIO exits.
Provost, a word with you! 
##The Provost re-enters.
###PROVOST 
What is it, father? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Now that you’ve come over, you should go away. Leave me with the girl awhile. My intentions and the fact that I’m a friar guarantee that nothing bad will happen to her. 
###PROVOST 
Very well. 
##The Provost exits. ISABELLA comes forward.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He who made you lovely made you good, as well. Beauty has a cheap kind of goodness, which is why beauty doesn’t last. But virtue lies at the heart of your character, so you will always be beautiful. I’ve heard about Angelo’s sexual advances to you, and if there weren’t other examples of such lapses, I’d be really surprised. What are you going to do to satisfy this stand-in and save your brother? 
###ISABELLA 
I’m going now to give him my answer: I’d rather my brother die by legitimate execution than have an illegitimate baby. But, oh, how wrong the good duke was about Angelo! If he ever returns and I can speak to him, the first words I speak will be to expose Angelo’s way of governing. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s not a bad idea. But, as the matter now stands, he’ll deny your accusation. He’ll say he was only testing you. So, listen to my advice. My delight in doing good gives me an idea for a solution. I’m convinced there’s a way you righteously can do a poor wronged lady some well-deserved good, save your brother from the cruel law, keep your own gracious self pure, and greatly please the absent duke, if he ever returns to hear about all this. 
###ISABELLA 
Tell me more. I have the courage to do anything, as long as it doesn’t strike me as wrong. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Virtue is bold, and goodness is never afraid. Have you ever heard of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who died at sea? 
###ISABELLA 
I’ve heard of the lady, and people always spoke well of her. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
She was supposed to marry this Angelo. They were engaged, and the wedding day was set. But before the ceremony, her brother Frederick was lost at sea, in the ship that was carrying his sister’s dowry. The poor woman suffered a heavy blow. She lost a famous, noble brother, who loved her dearly and devotedly. She lost with him her dowry, the bulk of her fortune, and with both, she lost her husband-to-be, this oh-so-respectable Angelo. 
###ISABELLA 
Can this be true? Did Angelo leave her? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Left her in her tears, without drying a single one of them. He reneged on his vows completely, saying he discovered that she’d been unfaithful to him. He gave her only grief, basically, and she still wears it, like a wedding dress. Her tears wash over him, but like a marble statue, he never budges. 
###ISABELLA 
It’s the equivalent of a death to take this poor girl away from the world! And life is so unfair, that this man lives! But how can she benefit from all this? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It’s a break that you can easily heal, and the cure not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonor. 
###ISABELLA 
Show me how, good father. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
This maid still loves Angelo. Logically, his unfair cruelty should have ended her love, but it’s actually intensified it, the way water becomes violent and choppy when it hits a barrier. Go to Angelo. Pretend to yield to his request, and obey his demands to the letter. But set some conditions: that you not spend much time together, that it be in the dark, that there be absolute silence, and that it be in a convenient place. When he agrees—and now here’s the key part—we’ll tell the wronged girl to go in your place. If their encounter later comes to light, it might compel him to compensate her. The result of all this: your brother is saved, your honor is maintained, poor Mariana is helped, and the corrupt deputy is punished. I’ll prepare the girl and make her ready for the encounter. If you think you can manage this, the double benefit outweighs any blame for the deception. What do you think? 
###ISABELLA 
I like the idea already, and I hope it’ll be successful. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
A lot depends on your ability to pull it off. Hurry over to Angelo. If he begs you to sleep with him tonight, promise to satisfy him. I’ll go to Saint Luke’s; poor Mariana is living there, in a country house. Arrange things with Angelo and come see me there, the sooner the better. 
###ISABELLA 
Thank you for your help. Goodbye, good father. 
##They exit, in separate directions.
##The street outside the prison.
## DUKE VINCENTIO, disguised as before, enters on one side. ELBOW and officers with POMPEY enter on the other.
###ELBOW 
No, but if you go on buying and selling men and women like beasts, everyone in the world will end up spawning bastards. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, heavens! What nonsense is this? 
###POMPEY 
Life’s become a lot less fun since the law took two crimes—prostitution and moneylending—and suppressed the one that was the most fun, while condoning the worse of the two. The thriving moneylender wraps himself in a warm fur coat, made of skins from the innocent lamb and trimmed in fur from the crafty fox, proving that craftiness is worth more than innocence. 
###ELBOW 
Come along, sir. Bless you, good father friar. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
And you, good brother father. How has this man offended you, sir? 
###ELBOW 
Actually, sir, he has offended the law. And, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir, because we found on him, sir, a strange device for picking locks, which we have sent to the deputy. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(to POMPEY) Shame, sirrah! A pimp, a wicked pimp! You support yourself by doing evil. Do you ever stop to think what it is to stuff your mouth or clothe your back from such a filthy vice? Say to yourself, I eat, dress myself, and live off abominable, beastly sex. Can you believe your way of life is a life, when it’s dependent on such stinking acts? Change your ways, change your ways. 
###POMPEY 
Yes, it does stink in a way, sir; but, sir, I would prove— 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
No, if the devil has given you excuses for sin, you’ll prove only that you belong to him. Take him to prison, officer. Punishment and religion must both be used on this crude beast before he improves. 
###ELBOW 
He has to appear before the deputy, sir, who’s already given him a warning. The deputy can’t stand pimps, and if he is a pimp, and appears before him, he would be better off being anywhere but there. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
If only we were all—as some of us seem to be—as free from sin as this pimp is from hypocrisy! 
###ELBOW 
Like your waist, his neck will soon have a rope around it, sir. 
###POMPEY 
I see help coming—and bail. Here’s a gentleman and a friend of mine. 
## LUCIO enters.
###LUCIO 
Hey there, noble Pompey! Oh dear, are you being paraded like a prisoner-of-war after the victorious Caesar’s chariot? What, aren’t there any more girls just turned women who can be had for a handful of dollars? Ha, don’t you have any answers? How do you feel about the new regime? Puts quite a damper on things, right? What do you say, old man? Hasn’t the world changed? What’s your mood nowadays, a bit sad and silent? Or how? What’s the plan? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
This is getting worse and worse. 
###LUCIO 
How’s my sweetheart, your boss-lady? Is she still a madam? 
###POMPEY 
Truthfully, sir, she’s worn out all her prostitutes, and is herself getting treated for an STD. 
###LUCIO 
That’s right, that’s the way it goes: your fresh-faced whore ages into a heavily made-up madam. It’s unavoidable. Are you going to prison, Pompey? 
###POMPEY 
I am indeed, sir. 
###LUCIO 
Not a bad thing, Pompey. Goodbye. Go and say I sent you. For debt, Pompey? Or something else? 
###ELBOW 
For being a pimp, for being a pimp. 
###LUCIO 
Well, then, put him in jail: if imprisonment is the punishment for being a pimp, then he deserves it. He’s undoubtedly a pimp, and has been for a long time. Born a pimp. Goodbye, good Pompey. Give my regards to prison. You’ll be a good husband now, Pompey—you’ll never leave home. 
###POMPEY 
I hope, sir, you’ll post bail for me. 
###LUCIO 
No, I won’t, Pompey. It’s not in style now. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your sentence. Show an iron will while you’re in iron chains. Adieu, Pompey. God bless you, friar. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
And you. 
###LUCIO 
Does Bridget still get dolled up, Pompey, ha? 
###ELBOW 
Come along, sir, come. 
###POMPEY 
You won’t bail me out, then, sir? 
###LUCIO 
Neither then, Pompey, nor now. What’s happening, friar? What’s the news? 
###ELBOW 
Come along, sir, come. 
###LUCIO 
Off to the doghouse, Pompey. Go. 
## ELBOW, POMPEY, and officers exit.
Any news, friar, of the duke? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I don’t know anything. Can you tell me any news? 
###LUCIO 
Some say he’s with the emperor of Russia. Others say that he’s in Rome. Where do you think he is? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I don’t know, but wherever he is, I wish him well. 
###LUCIO 
It was a crazy whim of his to sneak away from the city and pretend to be the commoner he was never born to be. Lord Angelo runs things well in his absence—he’s hard on criminals. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He does a good job of it. 
###LUCIO 
It wouldn’t hurt him to go a little easier on sex. There’s something too harsh in the way he’s handling that, friar. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It is too widespread a vice. It needs a severe cure. 
###LUCIO 
Yes, to tell the truth, this is a vice a lot of people practice. But it’s impossible to stamp it out totally, friar. You’d have to stop people eating and drinking first. They say this Angelo wasn’t the result of a normal act between a man and woman. Do you think that’s true? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
What was he the result of, then? 
###LUCIO 
Some say a mermaid gave birth to him, some that he was conceived by two dried codfish. But it’s a fact that when he pees, his urine is congealed ice. That I know to be true. And he’s an impotent puppet—that’s certain. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re a funny guy, sir, and speak freely. 
###LUCIO 
Well, what a cruel thing for him to do, to take a man’s life because his penis rose up! Would the absent duke have done something like this? Before he would’ve hanged a man for fathering a hundred bastards, he would’ve paid for nursing a thousand. He had some understanding of prostitution. He knew the game, and that made him merciful. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I never heard the absent duke accused of womanizing. He wasn’t inclined that way. 
###LUCIO 
Oh, sir, you’re wrong. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s not possible. 
###LUCIO 
Who, the duke? Yes, your fifty-year-old beggar-woman—he’d habitually make a deposit in her dish. The duke was a little kinky. He’d get drunk, too, let me tell you. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Surely, you’re being unfair to him. 
###LUCIO 
Sir, I was a close friend of his. The duke was a shy fellow, and I believe I know the reason for his sudden departure. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
What, please tell me, was the reason? 
###LUCIO 
No, sorry. It’s a secret that must stay locked in my mouth. But this I can tell you: the majority of his subjects thought the duke a wise man. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Wise! Well, there’s no doubt that he was. 
###LUCIO 
A very superficial, ignorant, thoughtless fellow. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re either jealous, mad, or mistaken. The way he conducts his life and his role as a ruler by themselves must earn him a better reputation. Judge him by his public actions and even the envious would see him as a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. So, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Or, if you do, you’re spitefully trying to tarnish his name. 
###LUCIO 
Sir, I know him, and I love him. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
If you loved him you would know him better, and if you knew him better you would love him more. 
###LUCIO 
Look, sir, I know what I know. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I can hardly believe that, since you don’t know what you’re talking about. But, if the duke ever returns, as we pray he will, I challenge you to justify your comments in front of him. If you’ve spoken the truth, you should have the courage to defend it. It’s my duty to summon you to testify. May I ask your name? 
###LUCIO 
Sir, my name is Lucio, and it’s well known to the duke. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He’ll know you even better, sir, if I live to report you. 
###LUCIO 
I’m not afraid of you. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, you hope the duke will never come back, or you think I’m too weak an enemy. But I really can do you a little harm—you’ll end up denying this. 
###LUCIO 
I’ll be hanged first. You’re wrong about me, friar. But forget all this. Can you tell me if Claudio is to die tomorrow or not? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Why should he die, sir? 
###LUCIO 
Why? For plugging a hole. I wish the duke were back again. His sexless deputy’s abstinence policy will depopulate the province. Even sparrows can’t nest on his roof, because they’re lecherous! The duke would have punished sexual acts privately—he’d never publicly expose them. I wish he were back! Claudio is condemned for getting undressed. Goodbye, good friar. Please pray for me. I tell you again, the duke was no choir boy—he would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s not past it yet, and I tell you, he’d French-kiss a beggar, even if she smelled of moldy bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Goodbye. 
##He exits.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Neither political power nor noble character can escape criticism; even the most virtuous person can be stabbed in the back by slurs. What king is so strong he can bottle up the poison of a slandering tongue? But who’s coming now? 
## ESCALUS, the Provost, and officers enter with MISTRESS OVERDONE. 
###ESCALUS 
Go on, take her to prison! 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
My good lord, be good to me. Your honor is said to be that of a merciful man, my good lord. 
###ESCALUS 
You’ve been warned two, three times, and you’re still committing the same crime! This is enough to turn mercy itself into a cursing tyrant. 
###PROVOST 
A madam for eleven years, your honor. 
###MISTRESS OVERDONE 
My lord, this is Lucio’s accusation against me. He got Miss Kate Keepdown pregnant, back in the days when the duke was still here, and he promised to marry her. Now his child will be fifteen months old on May Day. I kept the kid myself, and now see how he goes out of his way to abuse me! 
###ESCALUS 
That fellow is a dangerous fellow. Bring him before me. Take her away to prison! No more talking. 
##Officers exit with MISTRESS OVERDONE. 
Provost, my colleague Angelo won’t change his mind—Claudio must die tomorrow. Furnish him with priests, to give him spiritual consolation. If my colleague possessed my sense of pity, this wouldn’t be happening. 
###PROVOST 
This friar’s been with him, and helped him prepare for death. 
###ESCALUS 
Good evening, good father. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Bliss and goodness to you! 
###ESCALUS 
Where are you from? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Not from this country, though I happen to be here for the time being. I belong to a holy brotherhood, and have just come from Rome, on special business from the Vatican. 
###ESCALUS 
What’s the news from abroad? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
None, except that goodness is so sick that only death can cure it. People only want the latest thing, and it’s as dangerous to be faithful as it is virtuous to be promiscuous. There’s barely enough honesty left for it to be safe to get involved with people, but there’s enough blind trust to doom partnerships. The wisdom of the world runs on paradoxes like this. It’s old news, but everyday news. Tell me, sir, what sort of man was the duke? 
###ESCALUS 
Someone who, above everything else, truly wanted to know himself. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
What sort of things did he enjoy? 
###ESCALUS 
He enjoyed seeing someone else happy more than doing something that made himself happy—an even-tempered man. But let’s leave him to his affairs, with a prayer that they’ll be prosperous, and tell me how Claudio is. I understand you’ve visited him. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He claims to have received no unfair treatment from his judge, but willingly yields to the law’s verdict. Out of human weakness, he’d formed many deceptive hopes about a reprieve. But gradually I showed him these made no sense, and now he is ready to die. 
###ESCALUS 
You have fulfilled your duty to both God and the prisoner. I pleaded for the poor man as much as I could, without giving offense, but my fellow judge is so severe, I swear, he’s like Justice itself. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
If his own behavior matches the strictness of his judgments, it’s to his credit. But if he slips, he’s written his own sentence. 
###ESCALUS 
I’m going to visit the prisoner. Goodbye. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Peace be with you! 
## ESCALUS and the Provost exit.
(to himself) He who wants to be a ruler and enact heaven’s justice should be as holy as he is severe. He should find in himself a model of proper conduct, the grace to stand firm, and the strength to go forward, punishing others no more or less than he’d punish his own sins. Shame on him who cruelly strikes and kills others for the very faults he possesses! Shame on Angelo six times over, for weeding out my vice while nurturing his own! Oh, what evil an angelic-looking man can hide in himself! How this seemingly virtuous behavior, born out of sin, can deceive everyone! It’s like a spider web that traps small sins like small insects, but breaks when anything large and heavy touches it. I must combat vice with cunning. Tonight Angelo will sleep with his rejected, former fiancée. By deceit, the deceiver will be forced to pay for his wrongful demands, and fulfill his old contract. 
##He exits.
##The moated grange house at ST. LUKE’s.
## MARIANA and a Boy enter.
###BOY
(singing) Take, oh take those lips away, that swore such sweet lies, and those eyes, which trick the morning by shining bright as the sun at dawn. But give back, give back my kisses, which seal my love, but seal it in vain, seal it in vain. 
###MARIANA 
Stop singing, and leave, quickly. Here comes a man whose advice has often calmed me down. 
##The Boy exits.
## DUKE VINCENTIO enters, disguised as a friar.
I beg your pardon, sir. I wish you hadn’t found me listening to music. Please excuse me, and believe me, it drove away my joy and nurtured my sorrow. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s good, though music often has a magical power to make the bad seem good and encourage good people to misbehave. Please tell me, has anybody been asking for me here today? I promised to meet someone here about this time. 
###MARIANA 
No one’s been asking for you. I’ve been sitting here all day. 
## ISABELLA enters.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I believe you; she’s here now. May I ask you to leave for a little while? I’ll be with you shortly, and it’ll be to your advantage. 
###MARIANA 
I’m always grateful to you. 
##She exits.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Welcome—and perfect timing. What’s the news from our favorite deputy? 
###ISABELLA 
He has a garden surrounded by a brick wall, whose western side is backed by a vineyard. Leading to that vineyard is a gate of wooden planks that you open with this larger key. This other key opens a little door that leads from the vineyard to the garden. I’ve promised to meet him there, in the dark middle of the night. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
But do you know how to find the way there? 
###ISABELLA 
I’ve noted it carefully—he gave me the directions twice, whispering the details with care and using gestures to explain. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Are there any other agreed-on signals she has to give? 
###ISABELLA 
No, none, only a visit in the dark. And I’ve let him know I can only stay a short time, because I told him a servant would be waiting for me, under the pretense that I was coming about my brother. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’ve handled it well. I haven’t told Mariana a word of this yet. Hey, you in there! Come here! 
## MARIANA re-enters.
(to MARIANA) Please, let me introduce you to this girl. She’s here to help you. 
###ISABELLA 
That’s what I want to do. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Do you believe that I’ve got your best interests at heart? 
###MARIANA 
Good friar, I know you do, and that you’ve found a way to help. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Then take the hand of your new friend, who has a tale to tell you. I’ll wait for you until you’re ready, but hurry— night’s falling. 
###MARIANA 
Will you walk with me? 
## MARIANA and ISABELLA exit.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, you people of high rank! Millions of treacherous eyes are fixed on you, accompanied by a mass of hostile rumors that follow everything you do. A thousand imaginations make you the source of their silly fantasies and torture you with their delusions. 
## MARIANA and ISABELLA re-enter.
Welcome back. What did you decide? 
###ISABELLA 
She’ll do it, father, if you recommend it. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I don’t just recommend it. I beg her to do it. 
###ISABELLA 
When you leave him, all you have to do is say softly, “Now remember my brother.” 
###MARIANA 
Don’t worry about me. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
And, gentle daughter, don’t worry for yourself. He is your husband-to-be, so it’s no sin for you two to sleep together—your valid claim as his wife allows the deception. Come on, let’s go. We have to sow the seeds before we can reap the harvest. 
##They exit.
##A room in the prison.
##The Provost and POMPEY enter.
###PROVOST 
Come here, you. Can you cut off a man’s head? 
###POMPEY 
If the man’s a bachelor, sir, I can. But if he’s a married man, he’s also his wife’s head, and I can never cut off a woman’s head. 
###PROVOST 
Come on, sir, spare me your jokes and give me a straight answer. Claudio and Barnardine are to die tomorrow morning. Here in our prison we have a public executioner, who needs a helper. If you’ll take on the job of assisting him, it’ll free you from your chains. If you don’t, you’ll have to serve your full sentence, with a fierce whipping before you’re released because you’ve been a notorious pimp. 
###POMPEY 
Sir, I’ve been an illegal pimp for longer than I can remember, but I’ll be happy to be a legal hangman. I’d be glad for my new partner to teach me. 
###PROVOST 
Hey, Abhorson! Where are you, Abhorson? ABHORSON (the executioner) enters. 

###ABHORSON 
Did you call, sir? 
###PROVOST 
Here’s a fellow to help you with tomorrow’s executions. If he works out, settle on an annual salary and let him stay here with you. If he doesn’t, use him just for now and then fire him. He can’t claim to be too good for the work since he’s been a pimp. 
###ABHORSON 
A pimp, sir? To hell with him! He’ll discredit our profession. 
###PROVOST 
Go on, sir. You two are worth the same. No more than a featherweight’s difference, anyway. 
##He exits.
###POMPEY 
Sir, would you please—for you do have a pleasing face, except for your hanging expression—tell me if you call your job a profession? 
###ABHORSON 
Yes, sir, a profession. 
###POMPEY 
I’ve heard it said that painting, sir, is a profession, and since whores—who are in my field—paint their faces, they prove my occupation is a profession. But I’ll be hanged if I can imagine how hanging is a profession. 
###ABHORSON 
Sir, it is a profession. 
###POMPEY 
Can you prove it? 
###ABHORSON 
A thief steals and puts on the clothes of an honest man. If the thief thinks the clothes don’t make him seem honest enough, a truly honest man will think that’s appropriate. If the thief thinks the clothes make him seem extra honest, then the thief thinks the disguise fits just right. So someone is always happy with the way the disguise works for the thief. 
##The Provost re-enters.
###PROVOST 
Have you reached an agreement? 
###POMPEY 
Sir, I’ll work for him, because I think a hangman’s job is a sorrier one than a pimp’s—he asks forgiveness more often. 
###PROVOST 
You, fellow, have your block and your axe ready tomorrow at four o’clock. 
###ABHORSON 
Come on, pimp, I’ll show you the ropes. Follow me. 
###POMPEY 
I want to learn, sir. And I hope, if you ever get the chance to use me for your own execution, you’ll find me ready. Because, really, I owe you a good turn for your kindness. 
## POMPEY and ABHORSON exit.
###PROVOST 
Call Barnardine and Claudio here. I pity one, but not the other, even if he were my brother, as he’s a murderer. 
## CLAUDIO enters.
Look, Claudio, here’s your death warrant. It’s now dead midnight, and by 8 a.m. tomorrow you must be laid to eternal rest. Where’s Barnardine? 
###CLAUDIO 
As fast asleep as the most innocent of exhausted laborers. He won’t wake up. 
###PROVOST 
Who could do him any good, anyway? Well, go, prepare yourself. (knocking is heard offstage) 

What’s that noise? (to Claudio) Heaven give your spirits comfort! 
## CLAUDIO exits.
In a minute. I hope it’s some pardon or reprieve for gentle Claudio. 
## DUKE VINCENTIO enters, disguised as a friar.
Welcome, father. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
The best, most wholesome night spirits surround you, good Provost! Who’s been here lately? 
###PROVOST 
No one, since the curfew bell rang. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Not Isabel? 
###PROVOST 
No. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Someone will be, then, before long. 
###PROVOST 
Is there any news to give comfort to Claudio? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
There’s comfort in hope. 
###PROVOST 
Angelo’s a cruel deputy. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
No, no. His life parallels the same straight line that his mighty justice draws. With religious restraint, he suppresses in himself the same impulses he persecutes in others. If he were stained with the sort of sins he punishes, then he’d be a tyrant. But because he’s virtuous, he’s fair. (knocking is heard offstage) 

They’re here. 
##The Provost exits.
This provost is a nice man. It’s rare that a hardened jailer has sympathy for his fellow men. (knocking is heard offstage) 

What is that noise? That messenger’s so impatient he’s going to hurt that poor door with his knocking. 
##The Provost re-enters.
###PROVOST 
He’s stuck there until the officer at the gate wakes up to let him in. The officer’s up now. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Haven’t you received any order yet countermanding Claudio’s execution tomorrow? 
###PROVOST 
None, sir, none. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Even though it’s almost dawn, provost, you’ll have news before morning. 
###PROVOST 
Perhaps you know something. But I don’t think any reprieve is coming. There’s no precedent for it. Besides, Lord Angelo declared the opposite, in public, from the judge’s bench. 
##A Messenger enters. 
This is his lordship’s servant. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
And here comes Claudio’s pardon. 
###MESSENGER 
(presenting a paper) My lord has sent you this note, and charged me to tell you not to swerve from the smallest item in it—not the time, details, or anything else. Good morning, since I gather it’s almost morning. 
###PROVOST 
I will obey him. 
##The Messenger exits.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(to himself) This is his pardon, bought by the same sin Angelo committed. Crimes spread quickly when those in power perpetrate them as well. When evildoers extend mercy, they widen mercy’s grasp, pardoning other sinners because they love the sin. Now, sir, what’s the news? 
###PROVOST 
I told you. Lord Angelo, thinking me careless in my duties maybe, is putting unusual pressure on me. It’s strange—he’s never done this before. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Please, let’s hear the letter. 
###PROVOST 
(reads) “Whatever you may hear to the contrary, have Claudio executed by four o’clock, and Barnardine in the afternoon. Reassure me by sending me Claudio’s head by five o’clock. Be sure you do it, and be aware that more depends on it than I can reveal at this time. Don’t fail to do your duty, or you will be held accountable.” What do you say to this, sir? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Who is this Barnardine who’s to be executed in the afternoon? 
###PROVOST 
He was born in Bohemia, but raised here. He’s been a prisoner for the last nine years. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
How did it happen that the absent duke neither freed him nor executed him? I’ve heard he usually does one or the other. 
###PROVOST 
Barnardine’s friends kept getting him reprieves. And there was no clear evidence that he was actually guilty, until now, when Angelo came to power. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It’s clear now? 
###PROVOST 
Very clear, and he doesn’t deny it himself. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Has he shown remorse while in prison? What effect has it had on him? 
###PROVOST 
He’s a man who fears death as no worse than a drunken sleep. He’s careless, reckless, and fearless of the past, present, or future. He’s unaware of the concept of death, and desperately clinging to life. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He needs counseling. 
###PROVOST 
He won’t listen to any. He’s always had the freedom to go anywhere inside the prison. If you gave him a chance to escape, he wouldn’t run. He’s drunk many times a day, or spends many days entirely drunk. Often, we’ve woken him up, as if to take him to be executed, and shown him a pretend warrant. It’s never affected him at all. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
More of him soon. Provost, I see honesty and loyalty in your face. If I’m wrong, my old skill at reading people deceives me, but because I’m confident of my ability, I’ll take a chance. Claudio, whom you have a warrant to execute, deserves to die no more than Angelo, who sentenced him. I can clearly demonstrate this, but I need four days, so I’m going to ask you to do me an immediate and dangerous favor. 
###PROVOST 
What is it, sir? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Delay the death. 
###PROVOST 
Sorry, but how can I, with the time fixed and an explicit command to deliver his head to Angelo, at risk of penalty? I’ll find myself in Claudio’s shoes if I swerve from this in even the smallest way. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
By my holy vows, I guarantee your safety if you follow my instructions. Execute this Barnardine this morning, and take his head to Angelo. 
###PROVOST 
Angelo’s seen both of them, and will recognize the face. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, death’s a great disguiser, and you can help disguise him more. Shave his head and trim his beard, and say it was the prisoner’s request to be shaved before his death. You know that’s a common thing. If anything happens to you because of this—aside from thanks and good fortune —by the patron saint of my brotherhood, I’ll plead against it with my life. 
###PROVOST 
Forgive me, good father. It’s against my oath. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Did you swear allegiance to the duke, or to the deputy? 
###PROVOST 
To him, and to his representatives. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Will you think you’ve done nothing wrong if the duke vouches for the justice of your action? 
###PROVOST 
But how likely is that? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Not a possibility, but a certainty. Yet since I see you’re afraid, that neither my religious robes, integrity, nor arguments can easily persuade you, I’ll go farther than I meant to, to dispel all your fears. (displays a letter) Look, sir, here’s the duke’s handwriting and seal. You recognize them both, I’m sure. 
###PROVOST 
I know them both. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
This letter’s contents describe the duke’s return; you can read it over at your leisure, and you’ll learn that he’ll be here in two days. Angelo doesn’t know this, since today he’ll be getting some letters with strange news, maybe about the duke’s death, maybe about him entering some monastery—but nothing about what’s written here. Look, the morning star is out. Don’t be confused by all this. Everything makes sense after it’s been done. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I’ll give him confession, and prepare him for a better place. You’re still stunned, but this absolutely will explain everything to you. Let’s go, it’s almost dawn. 
##They exit.
##Another room in the prison.
## POMPEY enters.
###POMPEY 
I’ve got as many friends here as I did back at the brothel. You’d think it were Mistress Overdone’s very own house, so many of her old customers are here. First, here’s young Mister Hasty; he’s in for debt, having paid 197 pounds for some coarse brown paper and old ginger candy, and making back only three pounds selling it. Ginger wasn’t much in demand, because the old ladies were all dead. Then there’s one Mister Pirouette, defendant in a suit about four suits, brought by Mister Thick Velvet, the textile merchant. He’s being impeached over peach-colored satin. Then we’ve also got young Ditsy, and young Mister Cross-My-Heart, and Mister Cubic Zirconia and Mister Cheapskate, armed to fight duels, and young Kill-Heir who murdered robust Stuffed-Guts, and Mister Forward-Thrust the fighter, and dressed-to-kill Mister Shoe-Buckle, the world-traveler, and wild Half-Pint who stabbed Pots, and, I think, forty more gents—all great clients of our business, who now sing that old prison refrain, “Give us food for the Lord’s sake.” 
## ABHORSON enters.
###ABHORSON 
You there, bring Barnardine here. 
###POMPEY 
Mister Barnardine! You’ve got to get up, and get onto the scaffold. Mister Barnardine! 
###ABHORSON 
Hey, Barnardine! 
###BARNARDINE 
(offstage) Damn your throats! Who’s making all that noise? Who are you? 
###POMPEY 
Your friends, sir, the hangmen. Please be so good, sir, as to rise and be put to death. 
###BARNARDINE 
(offstage) Go away, scoundrel. Away! I’m sleepy. 
###ABHORSON 
Tell him he has to wake up, and quickly too. 
###POMPEY 
Please, Mister Barnardine, stay awake till you’re executed, and sleep afterwards. 
###ABHORSON 
Get in there and fetch him. 
###POMPEY 
He’s coming, sir, he’s coming. I hear the straw on his cell floor rustling. 
###ABHORSON 
Is the axe on the block, man? 
###POMPEY 
Very ready, sir. 
## BARNARDINE enters.
###BARNARDINE 
How goes it, Abhorson? What’s the news with you? 
###ABHORSON 
Actually, sir, I’d like you to get on with your prayers, because the warrant’s arrived. 
###BARNARDINE 
You jerk, I’ve been drinking all night. I’m not ready for it. 
###POMPEY 
Oh, all the better, sir, for he who drinks all night and is hanged early in the morning may sleep better all the next day. 
###ABHORSON 
Look, sir, here comes your holy confessor. Think we’re joking now? 
## DUKE VINCENTIO, disguised as a friar, enters.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Sir, out of my sense of charity, and hearing how hastily you have to leave, I came to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you. 
###BARNARDINE 
Not me, friar. I’ve been drinking hard all night, and either I get more time to prepare, or they’ll have to beat out my brains with clubs. I won’t agree to die today, that’s for sure. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, sir, you must, and so I beg you to look forward to the journey you’re going on. 
###BARNARDINE 
I swear I will not die today, no matter who tries to persuade me. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
But listen— 
###BARNARDINE 
Not a word: if you got anything to say to me, come to my cell. I’m not leaving it today. 
##He exits. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Unfit to live or die, that stony heart! After him, boys. Bring him to the block. 
## ABHORSON and POMPEY exit. 
##The Provost re-enters.
###PROVOST 
Now, sir, how is the prisoner? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
A creature unprepared, unfit for death. To send him off in his current frame of mind would be damnable. 
###PROVOST 
Here in prison, father, a notorious pirate named Ragozine just died this morning of a terrible fever. He was Claudio’s age, with the same color beard and hair. What if we forget about this reprobate until he’s agreeable, and send the deputy Ragozine’s head, which is more like Claudio’s? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, this is a heaven-sent chance! Do it at once. It’s getting near the time Angelo set for the execution. See that it’s done, and the head sent, as ordered. Meanwhile, I’ll persuade this uncivilized wretch to die willingly. 
###PROVOST 
We’ll do it, good father, immediately. But Barnardine must die this afternoon. And what do we do with Claudio, to save me from the danger of word getting out that he’s alive? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Let’s do this: put both Barnardine and Claudio in secret cells. Before two more days, it’ll be obvious you’re safe. 
###PROVOST 
I’m in your hands. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Hurry, get the head and send it to Angelo. 
##The Provost exits.
Now I’ll write letters to Angelo. The provost can deliver them. They’ll say I’m close to home and it’s of the utmost importance that I make a big public entrance. I’ll ask him to meet me at the holy springs three miles out of town. And from there, step by cool step, and observing all the proper procedures, I’ll deal with Angelo. 
##The Provost re-enters.
###PROVOST 
Here’s the head. I’ll carry it myself. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Suitable, isn’t it? Come back soon, because I want to talk with you about things that are for your ears only. 
###PROVOST 
I’ll be as fast as I can. 
##He exits.
###ISABELLA 
(offstage) Hello! Peace to all here! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s Isabel’s voice. She’s here to see if her brother’s pardon has come yet. But I’ll hide the news for her own good, to turn her despair into divine comfort when she least expects it. 
## ISABELLA enters.
###ISABELLA 
May I come in? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter. 
###ISABELLA 
All the better a morning when so holy a man says it to me. Has the deputy sent my brother’s pardon yet? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He has released him, Isabel, from the world. His head is off and sent to Angelo. 
###ISABELLA 
No, it’s not true. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It is. Be smart, daughter, and keep control of yourself. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, I’ll go and tear his eyes out! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
They won’t let you see him. 
###ISABELLA 
Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel! Cruel world! Damned Angelo! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
This neither hurts him nor helps you a bit. Control yourself and leave your case to heaven. Pay attention to what I say. Every syllable is truth you can rely on. The duke’s coming home tomorrow—no, dry your eyes. His confessor, who belongs to our monastery, gave me this information. He’s already sent word to Escalus and Angelo, who are preparing to meet him at the gates and surrender their authority to him there. If you can, steer your mind along the path I want it to follow. You’ll have your desire inflicted on this wretch, the favor of the duke, revenge to your heart’s content, and general acclaim. 
###ISABELLA 
I’ll do whatever you say. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Then give this letter to Friar Peter. It’s the one he sent me about the duke’s return. It’ll be a sign that I want to meet him at Mariana’s house tonight. I’ll tell him all about her case and yours, and he’ll bring you before the duke, and you can thoroughly accuse Angelo face-to-face. My poor self is bound by a sacred vow, so I won’t be there. (giving the letter) Go with this letter. Banish those worried tears with a light heart. Never trust my holy order again if I steer you wrong. Who’s here? 
## LUCIO enters.
###LUCIO 
Good evening. Friar, where’s the provost? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Not inside, sir. 
###LUCIO 
Oh, pretty Isabella, I’m sick at heart to see your eyes so red, but try to calm down. I have to dine on plain bread and water—to control my desire, I don’t fill my belly, since one big meal would get me excited. But they say the duke will be here tomorrow. I swear, Isabel, I loved your brother. If the good old whimsical duke, who loved to fool around in dark places, had been at home, Claudio would’ve lived. 
## ISABELLA exits.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Sir, the duke is nothing at all like you report. 
###LUCIO 
Friar, you don’t know the duke as well as I do. He’s more of a womanizer than you think. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Well, you’ll pay for this one day. Goodbye. 
###LUCIO 
No, wait. I’ll go along with you. I can tell you some great tales about the duke. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’ve already told me too many, sir, if they’re true. If they’re not true, I don’t want to hear any. 
###LUCIO 
I appeared before him once for getting a girl pregnant. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Did you do such a thing? 
###LUCIO 
Yes, I did, but I denied it under oath. They would’ve made me marry the rotten whore otherwise. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Sir, you look a lot nicer than you are. Goodbye. 
###LUCIO 
I swear, I’ll go with you to the end of the lane. If dirty talk offends you, we’ll avoid it. No, friar, I’m like a kind of burr—I’ll stick to you. 
##They exit.
##A room in ANGELO’s house.
## ANGELO and ESCALUS enter.
###ESCALUS 
Every letter he’s written has contradicted the others. 
###ANGELO 
In a very vague, inconsistent way. His behavior seems almost insane—pray God he’s not going mad! And why do we have to meet him at the gates, and surrender our authority there? 
###ESCALUS 
I can’t guess. 
###ANGELO 
And why, an hour before his arrival, should we announce that if anyone wants compensation for unjust treatment, they should come ready to present their petitions publicly? 
###ESCALUS 
He gives a reason for that: to be able to deal promptly with the complaints, and to save us from future lawsuits. 
###ANGELO 
Well, I urge you to announce it early in the morning. I’ll come pick you up at your house. Alert all the high-ranking officials who are supposed to meet him. 
###ESCALUS 
I will, sir. Goodbye. 
###ANGELO 
Good night. 
## ESCALUS exits.
This thing I’ve done has totally destroyed me. I’m stupid, can’t concentrate on anything. A girl robbed of her virginity, and by a respected public figure who enforced the law against sex! If she weren’t too ashamed to admit it, she could easily denounce me! But her head tells her not to, because my credibility is so strong that any scandal would ruin the person who spreads it, not me. I would’ve let Claudio live, except that a hotheaded youth like him might have come after me someday, feeling that his life is dishonored because he paid such a shameful price for it. Even so, I wish I’d let him live. Sadly, nothing goes right once we forget virtue. I don’t do the good thing, which I don’t want to do, but the evil I don’t want to commit, that I do. 
##He exits.
##Fields outside the town.
## DUKE VINCENTIO enters in his own clothing, with FRIAR PETER. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
At the right time, deliver these letters for me. 
##Holding letters
The provost knows about my plan. Once things get going, remember your orders and follow my lead, though sometimes you can deviate from the plan, if it seems appropriate. Go to Flavius’ house, and tell him where I’m staying. Inform Valentinus, Rowland, and Crassus, too, and ask them to bring the trumpeters to the gate. But send me Flavius first. 
###FRIAR PETER 
I’ll do it right away. 
##He exits.
## VARRIUS enters.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Thanks, Varrius, you got here fast. Let’s get going. More of our friends will be here soon, honorable Varrius. 
##They exit. 
##A street near the city gate.
## ISABELLA and MARIANA enter.
###ISABELLA 
I hate to speak so evasively. I’d rather tell the truth. But to accuse Angelo is your job, the friar says, and he advises me to lie, to hide our real aim. 
###MARIANA 
We should do as he says. 
###ISABELLA 
Besides, he tells me that I shouldn’t think it strange if he happens to contradict me. It’ll be like swallowing a bitter pill that offers a sweet cure. 
###MARIANA 
I wish Friar Peter— 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, wait! The friar’s here. 
## FRIAR PETER enters.
###FRIAR PETER 
Come on, I’ve found you a good place to stand, where you’ll be so positioned that the duke won’t be able to bypass you. The trumpets have blown twice, the most high-born and important people have already gathered at the gates, and the duke’s about to enter. So, let’s go! 
##They exit.
##The city gate.
## MARIANA wearing a veil, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER are at their stand. DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, lords, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, the Provost, officers, and citizens enter from several directions. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(to Angelo) My fellow nobleman, welcome! (to Escalus) My faithful old friend, I’m glad to see you. 
###ANGELO, ESCALUS 
Welcome home, your royal grace! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Many hearty thanks to you both. I’ve been asking about you, and I’ve heard such good things about your rule that I just had to thank you publicly, as a preview of more rewards to come. 
###ANGELO 
You make my debt to you even greater. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Oh, you’re extremely worthy, and it’d be wrong of me to hide it in my heart, when it deserves to be written in brass letters, as on a monument, where time can’t erase it. Give me your hand, and let the people see, so they’ll know how proud I am to display my high regard for you. Come, Escalus, you must walk with me on my other side. You make a fine supporter. 
## FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward.
###FRIAR PETER 
Now’s the time: speak up and kneel before him. 
###ISABELLA 
Justice, royal duke! Look down here, at a girl—I wish I could say a virgin—who has been wronged. Oh, worthy prince, don’t consider anything else until you’ve heard my valid case and given me justice, justice, justice, justice! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Describe how you’ve been wronged—in what way? By whom? Be brief. Lord Angelo here will give you justice. Tell him your complaint. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, worthy duke, you’re urging me to ask the devil for help. Listen to me yourself. What I have to say will result either in you not believing and punishing me, or you feeling compelled to right the wrong. Hear me, oh hear me, here! 
###ANGELO 
My lord, I’m afraid she’s not in her right mind. She’s appeared before me, begging for her brother, who was executed by the justice system— 
###ISABELLA 
By the justice system! 
###ANGELO 
And she will speak in a very bitter, strange way. 
###ISABELLA 
I’ll speak strangely, but truthfully. That Angelo’s a liar, isn’t that strange? That Angelo’s a murderer, isn’t that strange? That Angelo’s an adulterous thief, a hypocrite, a man who rapes virgins, isn’t that extremely strange? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s strange to the tenth degree. 
###ISABELLA 
It’s just as true as the fact that he’s Angelo, and this is all as true as it is strange. No, it’s true to the tenth degree, for the truth is the truth, no matter how much you multiply it. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Take her away! Poor soul, she’s insane. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, prince, I beg you, as you believe in a better world than this one, don’t dismiss me by thinking I’m mad! Don’t assume something’s impossible because it’s unlikely. It’s not impossible that the wickedest wretch on the face of the earth may look just as cautious, as dignified, as fair, as perfect as Angelo—even as Angelo, for all his official finery, badges, titles, and ceremonies, can be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince. If he’s less than a wretch, he’s nothing. But he’s more, if only I had more names for badness. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I declare, if she’s mad—as I believe she is—her madness has an oddly rational sound. I’ve rarely heard such coherent logic from someone insane. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, gracious duke, don’t harp on that. But don’t dismiss rational statements because they don’t jibe with appearances. Use your intelligence to uncover the hidden truth, which is obscured by lies that seem like truth. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
A lot of sane people make a lot less sense. What would you like to say? 
###ISABELLA 
I am the sister of one Claudio, sentenced to die by the decree against fornication—sentenced by Angelo. I was about to enter a convent, when my brother contacted me. He sent me a message through a man named Lucio— 
###LUCIO 
That’s me, if it please your grace: I came to her from Claudio, and asked her to try her good luck in asking Lord Angelo for her poor brother’s pardon. 
###ISABELLA 
Yes, that’s the man. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
No one asked you to speak. 
###LUCIO 
No, my good lord, but no one asked me to be quiet, either. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I’m asking you now, then. Remember it. And when you have your own business before me, pray heaven you behave yourself. 
###LUCIO 
I’ll take notice, your honor. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
The notice is for yourself. Pay attention to it. 
###ISABELLA 
This gentleman has told some of my story— 
###LUCIO 
Right. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It may be right, but you’re wrong to interrupt. Proceed. 
###ISABELLA 
I went to this wicked, evil deputy— 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re sounding crazy. 
###ISABELLA 
Excuse me—the choice of words is appropriate. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
That’s better. Continue. 
###ISABELLA 
To make a long story short—because it took a while, how I begged, how I prayed and kneeled, how he refused me, and how I replied—I’ll sadly and shamefully get to the awful ending. He wouldn’t release my brother unless I gave my chaste body over to his yearning lust. And after much internal debate, my sisterly pity overcame my honor, and I gave in to him. But having got what he wanted, early the next morning he sent an order for my poor brother’s head. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(sarcastically) This is very believable! 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, I wish it were as believable as it is true! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Heavens above, you poor fool, you don’t know what you’re saying, or else you’ve been bribed to falsely accuse him. First of all, his integrity is beyond reproach. Next, it makes no sense that he should so vigorously prosecute crimes he himself commits. If he had committed such a crime, he would’ve judged your brother against himself, and not executed him. Someone has put you up to this. Confess the truth, and tell us who urged you to come here with this accusation. 
###ISABELLA 
That’s it? Then, oh, you blessed angels above, help me be patient, and let time reveal the evil hiding here behind appearances! Heaven protect your grace from harm. Since you don’t believe me, I have to go. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I bet you’d like to go. Officer, take her to prison! Should I permit such destructive, scandalous rumors about someone so close to me? This must be a conspiracy. Who knew about your plan, and that you were coming here? 
###ISABELLA 
Someone I wish were here now, Friar Lodowick. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
A holy ghost, probably. Who knows this Lodowick? 
###LUCIO 
My lord, I know him. He’s the sort of friar who’s always meddling in people’s business. I don’t like the man. If he hadn’t been a member of the clergy, I would have punched him out for certain words he spoke against your grace while you were away. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Words against me? Some holy friar this is! And to set this wretched woman here against my replacement! Someone locate this friar. 
###LUCIO 
Just yesterday, my lord, I saw her and this friar at the prison. He’s a smart-aleck, a very nasty piece of work. 
###FRIAR PETER 
God bless your royal grace! I’ve stood by, my lord, and I’ve heard your royal ears deceived. First, this woman has wrongfully accused your replacement, who is as far from any sexual or moral misbehavior with her as she is from a virgin birth. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I never believed anything else. Do you know this Friar Lodowick she’s talking about? 
###FRIAR PETER 
I know him for a divine and holy man, not lowdown, and not someone who meddles in earthly pleasures, as this gentleman reports. And, trust me, he’s a man that never slandered your grace. 
###LUCIO 
My lord, he did, and very maliciously too. Believe it. 
###FRIAR PETER 
Well, in time he may come to clear himself, but at this instant he’s sick, my lord, suffering a rare fever. Learning there was an accusation planned against Lord Angelo, he personally asked me to come here and speak, as he would have, about what he knows is true and false. And when he’s summoned, he’ll give his oath and furnish proof that will clear everything up. This worthy nobleman, who’s been so publicly and personally accused, will be vindicated, and this woman will be discredited to her face, to such an extent that she herself will have to admit it. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Good friar, let’s hear it. 
## ISABELLA is taken away, under guard, and MARIANA comes forward, wearing a veil.
Isn’t this funny, Lord Angelo? Oh, heaven, the nerve of these wretched fools! Give us some seats. Come, Angelo, my friend. I won’t take any part in this. You be the judge of your own case. Is this the witness, friar? First, let her show her face, and then speak. 
###MARIANA 
Pardon me, my lord. I will not show my face until my husband bids me to. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
What, are you married? 
###MARIANA 
No, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Are you single? 
###MARIANA 
No, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
A widow, then? 
###MARIANA 
Neither, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
So, you are neither single, widow, nor wife? 
###LUCIO 
My lord, she may be a prostitute. Many of them are neither virgin, widow, nor wife. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Keep that fellow quiet. I wish he were up on some charge of his own. 
###LUCIO 
OK, my lord. 
###MARIANA 
My lord, I do admit I’ve never been married, and I also admit I’m not a virgin. I’ve slept with my husband, but my husband doesn’t know he’s slept with me. 
###LUCIO 
He was drunk then, my lord. That’s the best explanation. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
For silence’s sake, be silent yourself! 
###LUCIO 
OK, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
This is hardly a witness for Lord Angelo. 
###MARIANA 
I’m coming to it now, my lord. The woman who’s accusing him of fornication is actually accusing my husband. And she charges it was at the very time when, as I’ll swear, he was in my arms, making love to me. 
###ANGELO 
Is she accusing more men besides me? 
###MARIANA 
Not that I know of. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
No? You say your husband. 
###MARIANA 
Why, exactly, my lord. He’s Angelo, who believes he never slept with me, and who believes he slept with Isabel. 
###ANGELO 
This is a strange deception. Let’s see your face. 
###MARIANA 
My husband bids me to, so I’ll lift my veil. 
##Removing her veil.
This is the face, you cruel Angelo, that you once swore was well worth looking at. This is the hand that was locked in yours with a signed contract. This is the body that kept your appointment with Isabel, and satisfied you in your garden-house, pretending to be her. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Do you know this woman? 
###LUCIO 
Sexually, she says. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Quiet, you! 
###LUCIO 
Right, my lord. 
###ANGELO 
My lord, I must confess I know this woman. Five years ago, there was some talk of marriage between she and I. It was broken off, partly because her dowry fell short of the agreed amount, but mainly because she had a reputation for promiscuity. For the last five years, I haven’t spoken with her, seen her, or heard from her, I swear. 
###MARIANA 
Noble prince, as light comes from heaven and words from breath, as there is meaning in truth and truth in virtue, I am engaged to this man as strongly as words can make vows. And, my good lord, last Tuesday night in a garden house, he treated me as a wife. This being the truth, let me safely rise from my knees, or else let me be fixed here forever, like a marble monument! 
###ANGELO 
I was amused up until now, but now my patience is exhausted. My good lord, let me apply the full force of the law. I believe these poor, demented women are just tools of some more powerful person who has put them up to this. Give me the chance, my lord, to unravel this plot. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Yes, with all my heart, and punish them as much as you like. You foolish friar and you wicked woman, in collusion with that one we just took away—even if you swore by every single saint, do you think your oaths would mean anything against his worthiness and reputation, which are proven beyond a doubt? You, Lord Escalus, sit with my colleague. Do all you can to help him unravel this conspiracy and discover where it came from. There’s another friar who put them up to this. Send for him. 
###FRIAR PETER 
I wish he were here, my lord! Because he did encourage the women to make this accusation. Your provost knows where he lives and can go get him. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Go do it, immediately. 
##The Provost exits.
(to Angelo) And you, my noble and respected friend, who have a stake in seeing this matter to the end, deal with the crimes against you as you think best, with any form of punishment. I’ll leave you for a while, but don’t move until you have fully decided the fate of these slanderers. 
###ESCALUS 
My lord, we’ll do it thoroughly. 
## DUKE VINCENTO exits.
Signor Lucio, didn’t you say you knew this Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person? 
###LUCIO 
“A hood does not make a monk”—his friar’s clothes are the only holy thing about him. And he’s said very evil things about the duke. 
###ESCALUS 
We’ll ask you to stay here until he comes and we lay those charges against him. We think this friar’s a notorious character. 
###LUCIO 
As much as anyone in Vienna, on my word. 
###ESCALUS 
Call that Isabel here once again. I want to speak with her. 
##An attendant exits.
Please, my lord, let me do the questioning. You’ll see how I’ll handle her. 
###LUCIO 
Not better than he, according to her. 
###ESCALUS 
What did you say? 
###LUCIO 
Frankly, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she’d be more likely to confess. She might be ashamed to do it in public. 
###ESCALUS 
I’ll keep the matter out of the spotlight. 
###LUCIO 
That’s the way. Women are easiest in the dark. 
##Officers re-enter with ISABELLA. The Provost re-enters with DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar’s habit.
###ESCALUS 
(to Isabella) Listen, mi this woman contradicts everything you’ve said. 
###LUCIO 
My lord, here comes the rascal I was talking about, with the provost. 
###ESCALUS 
All in good time. Don’t speak to him until we summon you. 
###LUCIO 
Mum’s the word. 
###ESCALUS 
Now, sir, did you egg these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have confessed you did. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It’s a lie. 
###ESCALUS 
What! Do you know where you are? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
All due respect to your great office—even the devil gets some respect for being the king of Hell. Where’s the duke? He’s the one who should hear me speak. 
###ESCALUS 
We represent the duke, and we will hear you speak. See that you speak honestly. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Boldly, at least. But, oh, you poor souls, did you come to find your lambs in the fox’s den? Say goodnight to any justice, then. Is the duke gone? Then your case is gone too. The duke’s unjust, rejecting your accusation and turning your case over to the very villain you came here to accuse. 
###LUCIO 
This is the rascal I was talking about. 
###ESCALUS 
Why, you disrespectful and unholy friar, it’s not enough that you’ve enlisted these women to accuse this worthy man, but with your foul mouth you call him a villain within his earshot? And then to shift your attack from him to the duke himself, to accuse the duke of being unjust? Take him away, to the rack with him! We’ll tear you limb from limb, until we discover your motive. To call the duke “unjust”! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Don’t get so excited. The duke doesn’t dare to hurt my little finger any more than he’d torture his own. I’m not his subject, or a native of this province. My business in this state has made me an on-looker here in Vienna, where I’ve seen corruption boil and bubble until it overflows out of the brothels. You’ve got laws for all the crimes, but the crimes are so tolerated that the strong statutes are like those joke lists of “house rules” in stores—people look at them just to laugh. 
###ESCALUS 
Slandering the state! Take him away to prison! 
###ANGELO 
What evidence do you have against him, Signor Lucio? Is this the man you told us about? 
###LUCIO 
He’s the one, my lord. Come here, baldy. Do you know me? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the prison, back when the duke was away. 
###LUCIO 
Oh, you did? And do you remember what you said about the duke? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Definitely, sir. 
###LUCIO 
Do you, sir? And was the duke a pimp, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You must, sir, switch identities with me, before you claim those were my words. You were the one who said that about him, and much more, much worse. 
###LUCIO 
Damn you, fellow! Didn’t I smack you in the nose for your comments? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I swear I love the duke like I love myself. 
###ANGELO 
Look, how the villain would appease us now, after his treasonable slanders! 
###ESCALUS 
You can’t talk to this type of fellow. Take him away to prison! Where is the provost? Take him to prison! Put him in chains, gag him. Away with those loose women, too, and their co-conspirator. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(to the Provost) Wait, sir, stay a minute. 
###ANGELO 
Is he resisting arrest? Help the provost, Lucio. 
###LUCIO 
Come on, sir. Come on, sir. Come on, sir. Ugh! So, you bald, lying rascal, you want to keep your hood on, do you? Show your lowlife face, damn you! Show your thieving face, and be hanged in an hour! Won’t it come off? 
##He pulls off the friar’s hood, revealing DUKE VINCENTIO. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re the first lowlife to ever turn someone into a duke. First, provost, let me free these three gentle people. (to LUCIO) Don’t you sneak away, sir. The friar and you will have a chat later on. Hold him. 
###LUCIO 
This may turn out worse than hanging. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(to ESCALUS) I forgive the things you said to me. Sit down. We’ll take Angelo’s seat. (to ANGELO) Sir, if I may. Do you have any words, either intelligent or impudent, that can help you? If so, keep them until I tell my story. Don’t hold the truth back any longer. 
###ANGELO 
Oh my dreaded lord, I’d be even more guilty to think I could go undiscovered, now that I realize your grace, like some divine power, has seen my sins. So, good prince, stop inquiring about my shame. Let my confession count as my trial. I beg only for the mercy of an immediate sentence and then death. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Come here, Mariana. (to Angelo) Were you ever engaged to this woman? 
###ANGELO 
I was, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Take her and marry her at once. You perform the ceremony, friar, and when it’s done, bring him back here. Go with him, provost. 
## ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and the Provost exit. 
###ESCALUS 
My lord, I’m more amazed by Angelo’s dishonesty than by the strangeness of this situation. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Come here, Isabel. Your friar is now your prince, but my heart hasn’t changed with my clothes. I guided and devoted myself to your affairs then, and I’m still acting for you now. 
###ISABELLA 
Oh, forgive me! To think that I, your servant, unknowingly used and created problems for your royal person! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re forgiven, Isabel. And now, dear girl, be as generous to me. I know your brother’s death hurts you deeply. And you may be wondering why I disguised myself, working behind the scenes to save his life, and didn’t just use my authority rather than let him die. Sweet girl, it was the speed of his execution, which I thought would take longer, that ruined my plan. But, peace be with him! The afterlife is a better life, since you don’t have to fear death anymore. Try to take comfort in the fact that your brother has that happiness. 
###ISABELLA 
I do, my lord. 
## ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and the Provost re-enter.
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
For Mariana’s sake, you must forgive this newly married man, whose lecherous imagination wronged your well-defended honor. But after he condemned your brother, he committed two crimes, violating your virginity and breaking his promise about the pardon that your brother’s life depended on. Even the merciful part of the law cries out, “an Angelo for Claudio, death for death!” Haste always results in hasty decisions, and deliberation comes from slowness. One thing is rewarded by a similar thing, and the measure of justice you use will be the measure used against you. So, Angelo, your crime is clear for all to see, and it denies you the right to any preferential treatment, even if you yourself feel otherwise. I sentence you to be executed on the very block where Claudio knelt to die, and just as quickly. Take him away! 
###MARIANA 
Oh, my most gracious lord, please don’t make a mockery of my marriage! 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It’s your husband who’s made a mockery of your marriage. I thought it appropriate that you be married, to protect your honor. Otherwise, revealing that he’d slept with you would haunt your life and destroy your future prospects. As for his possessions, technically they belong to the state, but we are giving you a widow’s rights and bequeathing them to you, to buy you a better husband. 
###MARIANA 
Oh my dear lord, I don’t want any other man or any better man. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You shouldn’t want him. My decision is final. 
###MARIANA 
My gentle lord— 
##kneeling
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re just wasting your time. Take him to his death! 
##(to LUCIO)
Now, sir, about you. 
###MARIANA 
Oh, my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my side. Kneel with me, and for the rest of my life I’ll be at your service. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
It makes no sense to beg her. If she were to kneel and plead for mercy, her brother’s horrified ghost would break through his stone-covered grave and drag her away with him. 
###MARIANA 
Isabel, sweet Isabel, just kneel beside me, and hold out your hands. Don’t say anything, I’ll do all the talking. They say the best men are formed out of their faults, and most of them become much better for being a little bad. That might happen with my husband. Oh, Isabel, won’t you kneel? 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
He dies for Claudio’s death. 
###ISABELLA 
(kneeling) Generous sir, please look on this condemned man as if my brother were still alive. To some extent, I think his behavior was sincere, until he laid eyes on me. So, don’t let him die. My brother was justly treated, in the sense that he did the thing he was executed for. But Angelo didn’t actually fulfill his bad intentions, and his behavior should be considered with that fact in mind. Intentions are merely thoughts, and thoughts aren’t subject to our control. 
###MARIANA 
Merely, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Your pleading’s no use. Stand up, I say. Another crime has just occurred to me. Provost, why was Claudio beheaded at such an unusual hour? 
###PROVOST 
It was so ordered. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Did you have a special warrant? 
###PROVOST 
No, my good lord, it was a private message. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You’re fired for this. Turn in your keys. 
###PROVOST 
Forgive me, noble lord. I thought it might be wrong, but wasn’t sure. After further consideration, I did change my mind, and to prove I did, I kept alive another prisoner who was to be executed by a private order. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Who’s he? 
###PROVOST 
His name is Barnardine. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
I wish you had done the same with Claudio. Go get him. Let me see him. 
##The Provost exits.
###ESCALUS 
Lord Angelo, I am sorry that someone so educated and wise, as you always appeared to be, should slip so badly, both in the heat of desire and the lack of judgment afterward. 
###ANGELO 
I am sorry that I cause such sorrow, and it sticks so deeply in my penitent heart that it makes me crave death more than mercy. I deserve death, and beg for it. 
##The Provost re-enters, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO with his face covered, and JULIET. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Which one is this Barnardine? 
###PROVOST 
This one, my lord. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
A certain friar told me about this man. (to BARNARDINE) Fellow, you’re said to have a stubborn soul, one that can’t imagine an existence beyond this one, and shapes your life accordingly. You’re doomed. But I pardon you for all your crimes here on earth, and hope you’ll take advantage of this mercy to prepare for the better world to come. Friar, counsel him. I leave him in your hands. Who’s that covered-up fellow? 
###PROVOST 
This is another prisoner I saved, who should have died when Claudio lost his head. He looks almost exactly like Claudio. 
##He uncovers CLAUDIO. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
(to ISABELLA) If he resembles your brother, then for his sake, he’s pardoned. And for your own lovely sake, give me your hand and say you’ll be mine. He’s my brother, too, but there’ll be a more appropriate time for that. By the way Angelo is behaving, I think he realizes this means he’s safe. Well, Angelo, your evil has repaid you well. Make sure you love your wife since her worth is equal to yours. I’m feeling merciful, and yet here’s someone I can’t forgive. (to LUCIO) You, who called me a fool, a coward, a lecher, an ass, a madman. What did I ever do to you that you call me these things? 
###LUCIO 
I swear, my lord, I only spoke according to what people say of you. You can hang me for it, if you want, but I wouldn’t mind if you preferred to whip me. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
Whipping first, sir, and hanging afterward. Proclaim it, provost, around the city, that if this lecher wronged any woman, as I heard him swear himself he got someone pregnant, let her appear, and he’ll marry her. After the wedding, let him be whipped and hanged. 
###LUCIO 
I beg your highness, don’t marry me to a whore. Your highness just said I made you a duke. My good lord, don’t pay me back by making me husband of a cheating wife. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
By my honor, you will marry her. I forgive your slurs, and in so doing, lift your other punishments. Take him to prison, and see that my wishes are carried out. 
###LUCIO 
Marrying a whore, my lord, is like being pressed to death, whipped, and hanged. 
###DUKE VINCENTIO 
You deserve it for slandering a prince. 
##Officers exit with LUCIO. 
Claudio, the girl you wronged, make sure you marry her. Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo. I’ve heard her confession, and I know her virtue. Thanks, good friend Escalus, for being so good. A greater expression of my gratitude is yet to come. Thanks, provost, for your care and ability to keep secrets. I’m going to give you a better position. Forgive him, Angelo, for bringing you Ragozine’s head in place of Claudio’s. The crime redeems itself. Dear Isabel, I have a proposal that’s greatly to your benefit, if you’ll lend a willing ear. It’s along the lines of what’s mine is yours, and what’s yours is mine. So, accompany me to my palace, where I’ll show and tell you everything you ought to know. 
##All exit.

##Thunder and lightning. Three WITCHES enter
###FIRST WITCH
When should the three of us meet again? Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain? 
###SECOND WITCH
We’ll meet when the noise of the battle is over, when one side has won and the other side has lost. 
###THIRD WITCH
That will happen before sunset. 
###FIRST WITCH
Where should we meet? 
###SECOND WITCH
Let’s do it in the open field. 
###THIRD WITCH
We’ll meet Macbeth there. 
##The WITCHES hear the calls of their spirit friends or “familiars,” which look like animals—one is a cat and one is a toad.
###FIRST WITCH
(calling to her cat) I’m coming, Graymalkin! 
###SECOND WITCH
My toad, Paddock, calls me. 
###THIRD WITCH
(to her spirit) I’ll be right here! 
###ALL
Fair is foul, and foul is fair. Let’s fly away through the fog and filthy air. 
##They exit.
##Sounds of a trumpet and soldiers fighting offstage. KING DUNCAN enters with his sons MALCOLM and DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and a number of attendants. They meet a wounded and bloody CAPTAIN.
###DUNCAN
Who is this bloody man? Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt. 
###MALCOLM
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured. Hail, brave friend! Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it. 
###CAPTAIN
For a while you couldn’t tell who would win. The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move. The villainous rebel Macdonwald was supported by foot soldiers and horsemen from Ireland and the Hebrides, and Lady Luck was with him, smiling cruelly at his enemies as if she were his whore. But Luck and Macdonwald together weren’t strong enough. Brave Macbeth, laughing at Luck, chopped his way through to Macdonwald, who didn’t even have time to say good-bye or shake hands before Macbeth split him open from his navel to his jawbone and stuck his head on our castle walls. 
###DUNCAN
My brave relative! What a worthy man! 
###CAPTAIN
But in the same way that violent storms always come just as spring appears, our success against Macdonwald created new problems for us. Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons. 
###DUNCAN
Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? 
###CAPTAIN
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion. To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition. Maybe they wanted to take a bath in their enemies' blood, or make that battlefield as infamous as Golgotha, where Christ was crucified, I don’t know. But I feel weak. My wounds must be tended to. 
###DUNCAN
Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor. Take him to the surgeons. 
##The CAPTAIN exits, helped by attendants.
## ROSS and ANGUS enter.
Who is this? 
###MALCOLM
The worthy Thane of Ross. 
###LENNOX
His eyes seem frantic! He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell. 
###ROSS
God save the king! 
###DUNCAN
Where have you come from, worthy thane? 
###ROSS
Great king, I’ve come from Fife, where the Norwegian flag flies, mocking our country and frightening our people. Leading an enormous army and assisted by that disloyal traitor, the thane of Cawdor, the king of Norway began a bloody battle. But outfitted in his battle-weathered armor, Macbeth met the Norwegian attacks shot for shot, as if he were the goddess of war’s husband. Finally he broke the enemy’s spirit, and we were victorious. 
###DUNCAN
Great happiness! 
###ROSS
So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a treaty. We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars. 
###DUNCAN
The thane of Cawdor will never again betray me. Go announce that he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him. 
###ROSS
I’ll get it done right away. 
###DUNCAN
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won. 
##They all exit.
##Thunder. The three WITCHES enter.
###FIRST WITCH
Where have you been, sister? 
###SECOND WITCH
Killing pigs. 
###THIRD WITCH
And you, sister? 
###FIRST WITCH
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them. “Give me one,” I said. “Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman cried. Her husband has sailed off to Aleppo as master of a ship called the Tiger. I’ll sail there in a kitchen strainer, turn myself into a tailless rat, and do things to him— 
###SECOND WITCH
I’ll give you some wind to sail there. 
###FIRST WITCH
How nice of you! 
###THIRD WITCH
And I will give you some more. 
###FIRST WITCH
I already have control of all the other winds, along with the ports from which they blow and every direction on the sailor’s compass in which they can go. I’ll drain the life out of him. He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either at night or during the day. He will live as a cursed man. For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony. 
Although I can’t make his ship disappear, I can still make his journey miserable. Look what I have here. 
###SECOND WITCH
Show me, show me. 
###FIRST WITCH
Here I have the thumb of a pilot who was drowned while trying to return home. 
##A drum sounds offstage.
###THIRD WITCH
A drum, a drum! Macbeth has come. 
###ALL
(dancing together in a circle) We weird sisters, hand in hand, swift travelers over the sea and land, dance around and around like so. Three times to yours, and three times to mine, and three times again, to add up to nine. Enough! The charm is ready. 
## MACBETH and BANQUO enter.
###MACBETH
(to BANQUO) I have never seen a day that was so good and bad at the same time. 
###BANQUO
How far is it supposed to be to Forres? (he sees the WITCHES) What are these creatures? They’re so withered-looking and crazily dressed. They don’t look like they belong on this planet, but I see them standing here on Earth. (to the WITCHES) Are you alive? Can you answer questions? You seem to understand me, because each of you has put a gruesome finger to her skinny lips. You look like women, but your beards keep me from believing that you really are. 
###MACBETH
Speak, if you can. What kind of creatures are you? 
###FIRST WITCH
All hail, Macbeth! Hail to you, thane of Glamis! 
###SECOND WITCH
All hail, Macbeth! Hail to you, thane of Cawdor! 
###THIRD WITCH
All hail, Macbeth, the future king! 
###BANQUO
My dear Macbeth, why do you look so startled and afraid of these nice things they’re saying? (to the WITCHES) Tell me honestly, are you illusions, or are you really what you seem to be? You’ve greeted my noble friend with honors and talk of a future so glorious that you’ve made him speechless. But you don’t say anything to me. If you can see the future and say how things will turn out, tell me. I don’t want your favors and I’m not afraid of your hatred. 
###FIRST WITCH
Hail! 
###SECOND WITCH
Hail! 
###THIRD WITCH
Hail! 
###FIRST WITCH
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater. 
###SECOND WITCH
You are not as happy as Macbeth, yet much happier. 
###THIRD WITCH
Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo! 
###FIRST WITCH
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! 
###MACBETH
Wait! You only told me part of what I want to know. Stay and tell me more. I already know I am the thane of Glamis because I inherited the position when my father, Sinel, died. But how can you call me the thane of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor is alive, and he’s a rich and powerful man. And for me to be the king is completely impossible, just as it’s impossible for me to be thane of Cawdor. Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting? Speak, I command you. 
##The WITCHESvanish.
###BANQUO
The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth. Where did they disappear to? 
###MACBETH
Into thin air. Their bodies melted like breath in the wind. I wish they had stayed! 
###BANQUO
Were these things we’re talking about really here? Or are we both on drugs? 
###MACBETH
Your children will be kings. 
###BANQUO
You will be the king. 
###MACBETH
And thane of Cawdor too. Isn’t that what they said? 
###BANQUO
That’s exactly what they said. Who’s this? 
## ROSS and ANGUS enter.
###ROSS
The king was happy to hear of your success, Macbeth. Whenever he hears the story of your exploits in the fight against the rebels, he becomes so amazed it makes him speechless. He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you. Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country. 
###ANGUS
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him. Your real reward won’t come from us. 
###ROSS
And to give you a taste of what’s in store for you, he told me to call you the thane of Cawdor. So hail, thane of Cawdor! That title belongs to you now. 
###BANQUO
(shocked) Can the devil tell the truth? 
###MACBETH
The thane of Cawdor is still alive. Why are you giving me his title? 
###ANGUS
The man who was the thane of Cawdor is still alive, but he’s been sentenced to death, and he deserves to die. I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies. But his treason, which has been proven, and to which he’s confessed, means he’s finished. 
###MACBETH
(to himself) It’s just like they said—now I’m the thane of Glamis and the thane of Cawdor. And the best part of what they predicted is still to come. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Thank you for the news. (speaking so that only BANQUO can hear) Aren’t you beginning to hope your children will be kings? After all, the witches who said I was thane of Cawdor promised them nothing less. 
###BANQUO
If you trust what they say, you might be on your way to becoming king, as well as thane of Cawdor. But this whole thing is strange. The agents of evil often tell us part of the truth in order to lead us to our destruction. They earn our trust by telling us the truth about little things, but then they betray us when it will damage us the most. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Gentlemen, I’d like to have a word with you, please. 
## ROSS, ANGUS, and BANQUO move to one side.
###MACBETH
(to himself) So far the witches have told me two things that came true, so it seems like this will culminate in my becoming king. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Thank you, gentlemen. (to himself) This supernatural temptation doesn’t seem like it can be a bad thing, but it can’t be good either. If it’s a bad thing, why was I promised a promotion that turned out to be true? Now I’m the thane of Cawdor, just like they said I would be. But if this is a good thing, why do I find myself thinking about murdering King Duncan, a thought so horrifying that it makes my hair stand on end and my heart pound inside my chest? The dangers that actually threaten me here and now frighten me less than the horrible things I’m imagining. 
Even though it’s just a fantasy so far, the mere thought of committing murder shakes me up so much that I hardly know who I am anymore. My ability to act is stifled by my thoughts and speculations, and the only things that matter to me are things that don’t really exist. 
###BANQUO
Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze. 
###MACBETH
(to himself) If fate wants me to be king, perhaps fate will just make it happen and I won’t have to do anything. 
###BANQUO
(to ROSS and ANGUS) Macbeth is not used to his new titles. They’re like new clothes: they don’t fit until you break them in over time. 
###MACBETH
(to himself) One way or another, what’s going to happen is going to happen. 
###BANQUO
Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are. 
###MACBETH
I beg your pardon; I was distracted. Kind gentlemen, I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day. Let’s go to the king. (speaking so that only BANQUO can hear) Think about what happened today, and when we’ve both had time to consider things, let’s talk. 
###BANQUO
Absolutely. 
###MACBETH
Until then, we’ve said enough. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Let’s go, my friends. 
##They all exit.
##A trumpet fanfare sounds. KING DUNCAN, LENNOX, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, and their attendants enter.
###DUNCAN
Has the former thane of Cawdor been executed yet? Haven’t the people in charge of that come back? 
###MALCOLM
My king, they haven’t come back yet. But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply. He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died. He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage. 
###DUNCAN
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face. I trusted Cawdor completely. 
## MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS enter.
(to MACBETH) My worthiest kinsman! Just this moment I was feeling guilty for not having thanked you enough. You have done so much for me so fast that it has been impossible to reward you properly. If you deserved less, then perhaps my payment would have matched your deeds! All I can say is that I owe you more than I can ever repay. 
###MACBETH
The opportunity to serve you is its own reward. Your only duty, your highness, is to accept what we owe you. Our duty to you and your state is like the duty of children to their father or servants to their master. By doing everything we can to protect you, we’re only doing what we should. 
###DUNCAN
You are welcome here. By making you thane of Cawdor, I have planted the seeds of a great career for you, and I will make sure they grow. (to BANQUO) Noble Banquo, you deserve no less than Macbeth, and everyone should know it. Let me bring you close to me and give you the benefit of my love and good will. 
###BANQUO
Then if I accomplish anything great, it will be a credit to you. 
###DUNCAN
My joy is so overwhelming it brings tears to my eyes. My sons, relatives, lords, and all those closest to me, I want you to witness that I will bestow my kingdom on my eldest son, Malcolm. Today I name him the prince of Cumberland. But Malcolm isn’t going to be alone in receiving honors—titles of nobility will shine like stars on all of you who deserve them. (to MACBETH) And now, let’s go to your castle at Inverness, where I will become even more obliged to you because of your hospitality. 
###MACBETH
I’m not happy unless I can be working for you. I will go ahead and bring my wife the good news that you are coming. With that, I’ll be off. 
###DUNCAN
My worthy Cawdor! 
###MACBETH
(to himself) Malcolm is now the prince of Cumberland! To become king myself, I’m either going to have to step over him or give up, because he’s in my way. Stars, hide your light so no one can see the terrible desires within me. I won’t let my eye look at what my hand is doing, but in the end I’m still going to do that thing I’d be horrified to see. 
## MACBETH exits.
###DUNCAN
(to BANQUO, in the middle of a conversation we haven’t heard) You’re right, Banquo. Macbeth is every bit as valiant as you say, and I am satisfied with these praises of him. Let’s follow after him, now that he has gone ahead to prepare our welcome. He is a man without equal. 
##Trumpet fanfare. They exit.
## LADY MACBETH enters, reading a letter.
###LADY MACBETH
“The witches met me on the day of my victory in battle, and I have since learned that they have supernatural knowledge. When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air. While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!' I thought I should tell you this news, my dearest partner in greatness, so that you could rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us. Keep it secret, and farewell.” 
(she looks up from the letter) You are thane of Glamis and Cawdor, and you’re going to be king, just like you were promised. But I worry about whether or not you have what it takes to seize the crown. You are too full of the milk of human kindness to strike aggressively at your first opportunity. You want to be powerful, and you don’t lack ambition, but you don’t have the mean streak that these things call for. The things you want to do, you want to do like a good man. You don’t want to cheat, yet you want what doesn’t belong to you. There’s something you want, but you’re afraid to do what you need to do to get it. You want it to be done for you. Hurry home so I can persuade you and talk you out of whatever’s keeping you from going after the crown. After all, fate and witchcraft both seem to want you to be king. 
##A SERVANT enters.
What news do you bring? 
###SERVANT
The king is coming here tonight. 
###LADY MACBETH
You must be crazy to say that! Isn’t Macbeth with the king, and wouldn’t Macbeth have told me in advance so I could prepare, if the king were really coming? 
###SERVANT
I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. Macbeth is coming. He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message. 
###LADY MACBETH
Take good care of him. He brings great news. 
##The SERVANT exits.
So the messenger is short of breath, like a hoarse raven, as he announces Duncan’s entrance into my fortress, where he will die. Come, you spirits that asist murderous thoughts, make me less like a woman and more like a man, and fill me from head to toe with deadly cruelty! Thicken my blood and clog up my veins so I won’t feel remorse, so that no human compassion can stop my evil plan or prevent me from accomplishing it! Come to my female breast and turn my mother’s milk into poisonous acid, you murdering demons, wherever you hide, invisible and waiting to do evil! Come, thick night, and cover the world in the darkest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife can’t see the wound it cuts open, and so heaven can’t peep through the darkness and cry, “No! Stop!” 
## MACBETH enters.
Great thane of Glamis! Worthy thane of Cawdor! You’ll soon be greater than both those titles, once you become king! Your letter has transported me from the present moment, when who knows what will happen, and has made me feel like the future is already here. 
###MACBETH
My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight. 
###LADY MACBETH
And when is he leaving? 
###MACBETH
He plans to leave tomorrow. 
###LADY MACBETH
That day will never come. Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book. In order to deceive them, you must appear the way they expect you to look. Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words. You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower. The king is coming, and he’s got to be taken care of. Let me handle tonight’s preparations, because tonight will change every night and day for the rest of our lives. 
###MACBETH
We will speak about this further. 
###LADY MACBETH
You should project a peaceful mood, because if you look troubled, you will arouse suspicion. Leave all the rest to me. 
##They exit.
##The stage is lit by torches. Hautboyshautboy is a loud woodwind instrument—the ancestor of the modern oboe—used in outdoor ceremonies.Hautboys play. DUNCAN enters, together with MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and their attendants.
###DUNCAN
This castle is in a pleasant place. The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses. 
###BANQUO
The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are. There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed. I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest. 
## LADY MACBETH enters.
###DUNCAN
Look, here comes our honored hostess! Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love. In doing so, I’m teaching you to thank me for the incovenience I’m causing you by being here, because it comes from my love to you. 
###LADY MACBETH
Everything we’re doing for you, even if it were doubled and then doubled again, is nothing compared to the honors you have brought to our family. We gladly welcome you as our guests, with gratitude for both the honors you’ve given us before and the new honors you’ve just given us. 
###DUNCAN
Where is Macbeth, the thane of Cawdor? We followed closely after him. I hoped to arrive here before him, but he rides swiftly. And his great love, which is as sharp as his spur, helped him beat us here. Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight. 
###LADY MACBETH
We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours. 
###DUNCAN
Give me your hand. Bring me to my host, Macbeth. I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him. Whenever you’re ready, hostess. 
##They all exit.
##Hautboys play. The stage is lit by torches. A butler enters, and various servants carry utensils and dishes of food across the stage. Then MACBETH enters.
###MACBETH
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly. If the assassination of the king could work like a net, sweeping up everything and preventing any consequences, then the murder would be the be-all and end-all of the whole affair, and I would gladly put my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it. But for crimes like these there are still punishments in this world. By committing violent crimes we only teach other people to commit violence, and the violence of our students will come back to plague us teachers. Justice, being equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the poisoned cup that we serve to others. The king trusts me in two ways. First of all, I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should always try to protect him. Second, I am his host, so I should be closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to murder him myself. Besides, Duncan has been such a humble leader, so free of corruption, that his virtuous legacy will speak for him when he dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against the injustice of his murder. Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind with winged angels on invisible horses through the air to spread news of the horrible deed to everyone everywhere. People will shed a flood of tears that will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of rain. I can’t spur myself to action. The only thing motivating me is ambition, which makes people rush ahead of themselves toward disaster. 
## LADY MACBETH enters.
What news do you have? 
###LADY MACBETH
He has almost finished dinner. Why did you leave the dining room? 
###MACBETH
Has he asked for me? 
###LADY MACBETH
Don’t you know he has? 
###MACBETH
We can’t go on with this plan. The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people. I want to enjoy these honors while the feeling is fresh and not throw them away so soon. 
###LADY MACBETH
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before? Have you gone to sleep and woken up green and pale in fear of this idea? From now on this is what I’ll think of your love. Are you afraid to act the way you desire? Will you take the crown you want so badly, or will you live as a coward, always saying “I can’t” after you say “I want to”? You’re like the poor cat in the old story. 
###MACBETH
Please, stop! I dare to do only what is proper for a man to do. He who dares to do more is not a man at all. 
###LADY MACBETH
If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this? When you dared to do it, that’s when you were a man. And if you go one step further by doing what you dared to do before, you’ll be that much more the man. The time and place weren’t right before, but you would have gone ahead with the murder anyhow. Now the time and place are just right, but they’re almost too good for you. I have suckled a baby, and I know how sweet it is to love the baby at my breast. But even as the baby was smiling up at me, I would have plucked my nipple out of its mouth and smashed its brains out against a wall if I had sworn to do that the same way you have sworn to do this. 
###MACBETH
But if we fail— 
###LADY MACBETH
We, fail? If you get your courage up, we can’t fail. When Duncan is asleep—the day’s hard journey has definitely made him tired—I’ll get his two servants so drunk that their memory will go up in smoke through the chimneys of their brains. When they lie asleep like pigs, so drunk they’ll be dead to the world, what won’t you and I be able to do to the unguarded Duncan? And whatever we do, we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants. 
###MACBETH
May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine. Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits? 
###LADY MACBETH
Who could think it happened any other way? We’ll be grieving loudly when we hear that Duncan has died. 
###MACBETH
Now I’m decided, and I will exert every muscle in my body to commit this crime. Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess. Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart. 
##They exit.
## BANQUO enters with FLEANCE, who lights the way with a torch.
###BANQUO
How’s the night going, boy? 
###FLEANCE
The moon has set. The clock hasn’t struck yet. 
###BANQUO
The moon sets at twelve, right? 
###FLEANCE
I think it’s later than that, sir. 
###BANQUO
Here, take my sword. The heavens are being stingy with their light. Take this, too. I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep. Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest! 
## MACBETH enters with a SERVANT, who carries a torch.
Give me my sword. Who’s there? 
###MACBETH
A friend. 
###BANQUO
You’re not asleep yet, sir? The king’s in bed. He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants. This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality. (he hands MACBETH a diamond) 
###MACBETH
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to. 
###BANQUO
Everything’s OK. I had a dream last night about the three witches. At least part of what they said about you was true. 
###MACBETH
I don’t think about them now. But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing. 
###BANQUO
Whenever you like. 
###MACBETH
If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you. 
###BANQUO
I’ll do whatever you say, as long as I can do it with a clear conscience. 
###MACBETH
Rest easy in the meantime. 
###BANQUO
Thank you, sir. You do the same. 
## BANQUO and FLEANCE exit.
###MACBETH
(to the SERVANT) Go and tell your mistress to strike the bell when my drink is ready. Get yourself to bed. 
##The SERVANT exits.
### 
Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand? (to the dagger) Come, let me hold you. (he grabs at the air in front of him without touching anything) I don’t have you but I can still see you. Fateful apparition, isn’t it possible to touch you as well as see you? Or are you nothing more than a dagger created by the mind, a hallucination from my fevered brain? I can still see you, and you look as real as this other dagger that I’m pulling out now. (he draws a dagger) You’re leading me toward the place I was going already, and I was planning to use a weapon just like you. My eyesight must either be the one sense that’s not working, or else it’s the only one that’s working right. I can still see you, and I see blood splotches on your blade and handle that weren’t there before. (to himself) There’s no dagger here. It’s the murder I’m about to do that’s making me think I see one. Now half the world is asleep and being deceived by evil nightmares. Witches are offering sacrifices to their goddess Hecate. Old man murder, having been roused by the howls of his wolf, walks silently to his destination, moving like Tarquin, as quiet as a ghost. (speaking to the ground) Hard ground, don’t listen to the direction of my steps. I don’t want you to echo back where I am and break the terrible stillness of this moment, a silence that is so appropriate for what I’m about to do. While I stay here talking, Duncan lives. The more I talk, the more my courage cools. 
##A bell rings.
I’m going now. The murder is as good as done. The bell is telling me to do it. Don’t listen to the bell, Duncan, because it summons you either to heaven or to hell. 
## MACBETH exits.
## LADY MACBETH enters.
###LADY MACBETH
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold. The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up. Listen! Quiet! That was the owl that shrieked, with a scary “good night” like the bells they ring before they execute people. Macbeth must be killing the king right now. The doors to Duncan’s chamber are open, and the drunk servants make a mockery of their jobs by snoring instead of protecting the king. I put so many drugs in their drinks that you can’t tell if they’re alive or dead. 
###MACBETH
(from offstage) Who’s there? What is it? 
###LADY MACBETH
Oh no, I’m afraid the servants woke up, and the murder didn’t happen. For us to attempt murder and not succeed would ruin us. (She hears a noise.) Listen to that! I put the servants' daggers where Macbeth would find them. He couldn’t have missed them. If Duncan hadn’t reminded me of my father when I saw him sleeping, I would have killed him myself. 
## MACBETH enters carrying bloody daggers.
My husband! 
###MACBETH
I have done the deed. Did you hear a noise? 
###LADY MACBETH
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Didn’t you say something? 
###MACBETH
When? 
###LADY MACBETH
Just now. 
###MACBETH
As I came down? 
###LADY MACBETH
Yes. 
###MACBETH
Listen! Who’s sleeping in the second chamber? 
###LADY MACBETH
Donalbain. 
###MACBETH
(looking at his bloody hands) This is a sorry sight. 
###LADY MACBETH
That’s a stupid thing to say. 
###MACBETH
One of the servants laughed in his sleep, and one cried, “Murder!” and they woke each other up. I stood and listened to them, but then they said their prayers and went back to sleep. 
###LADY MACBETH
Malcolm and Donalbain are asleep in the same room. 
###MACBETH
One servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other replied, “Amen,” as if they had seen my bloody hands. Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” 
###LADY MACBETH
Don’t think about it so much. 
###MACBETH
But why couldn’t I say “Amen”? I desperately needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat. 
###LADY MACBETH
We can’t think that way about what we did. If we do, it’ll drive us crazy. 
###MACBETH
I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more! Macbeth is murdering sleep.” Innocent sleep. Sleep that soothes away all our worries. Sleep that puts each day to rest. Sleep that relieves the weary laborer and heals hurt minds. Sleep, the main course in life’s feast, and the most nourishing. 
###LADY MACBETH
What are you talking about? 
###MACBETH
The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house. “Macbeth has murdered sleep, and therefore Macbeth will sleep no more.” 
###LADY MACBETH
Who said that? Why, my worthy lord, you let yourself become weak when you think about things in this cowardly way. Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands. Why did you carry these daggers out of the room? They have to stay there. Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood. 
###MACBETH
I can’t go back. I’m afraid even to think about what I’ve done. I can’t stand to look at it again. 
###LADY MACBETH
Coward! Give me the daggers. Dead and sleeping people can’t hurt you any more than pictures can. Only children are afraid of scary pictures. If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood. We must make it seem like they’re guilty. 
## LADY MACBETH exits.
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
###MACBETH
Where is that knocking coming from? What’s happening to me, that I’m frightened of every noise? (looking at his hands) Whose hands are these? Ha! They’re plucking out my eyes. Will all the water in the ocean wash this blood from my hands? No, instead my hands will stain the seas scarlet, turning the green waters red. 
## LADY MACBETH enters.
###LADY MACBETH
My hands are as red as yours, but I would be ashamed if my heart were as pale and weak. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
I hear someone knocking at the south entry. Let’s go back to our bedroom. A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt. It’s so simple! You’ve lost your resolve. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
Listen! There’s more knocking. Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake. Snap out of your daze. 
###MACBETH
Rather than have to think about my crime, I’d prefer to be completely unconscious. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
Wake Duncan with your knocking. I wish you could! 
##They exit.
##A sound of knocking from offstage. A PORTERA porter is a doorkeeper.PORTER , who is obviously drunk, enters.
###PORTER
This is a lot of knocking! Come to think of it, if a man were in charge of opening the gates of hell to let people in, he would have to turn the key a lot. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
Knock, knock, knock! (pretending he’s the gatekeeper in hell) Who’s there, in the devil’s name? Maybe it’s a farmer who killed himself because grain was cheap. (talking to the imaginary farmer) You’re here just in time! I hope you brought some handkerchiefs; you’re going to sweat a lot here. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
Knock, knock! Who’s there, in the other devil’s name? Maybe it’s some slick, two-faced con man who lied under oath. But he found out that you can’t lie to God, and now he’s going to hell for perjury. Come on in, con man. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes. But now that tight pants are in fashion he can’t get away with it. Come on in, tailor. You can heat your iron up in here. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
Knock, knock! Never a moment of peace! Who are you? Ah, this place is too cold to be hell. I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore. I was going to let someone from every profession into hell. 
##A sound of knocking from offstage.
I’m coming, I’m coming! Please, don’t forget to leave me a tip. 
##The PORTER opens the gate.
## MACDUFF and LENNOX enter.
###MACDUFF
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now? 
###PORTER
That’s right sir, we were drinking until 3 A.M., and drink, sir, makes a man do three things. 
###MACDUFF
What three things does drink make a man do? 
###PORTER
Drinking turns your nose red, it puts you to sleep, and it makes you urinate. Lust it turns on but also turns off. What I mean is, drinking stimulates desire but hinders performance. Therefore, too much drink is like a con artist when it comes to your sex drive. It sets you up for a fall. It gets you up but it keeps you from getting off. It persuades you and discourages you. It gives you an erection but doesn’t let you keep it, if you see what I’m saying. It makes you dream about erotic experiences, but then it leaves you asleep and needing to pee. 
###MACDUFF
I believe drink did all of this to you last night. 
###PORTER
It did, sir. It got me right in the throat. But I got even with drink. I was too strong for it. Although it weakened my legs and made me unsteady, I managed to vomit it out and laid it flat on the ground. 
###MACDUFF
Is your master awake? 
## MACBETH enters.
Our knocking woke him up. Here he comes. 
###LENNOX
Good morning, noble sir. 
###MACBETH
Good morning to both of you. 
###MACDUFF
Is the king awake, worthy thane? 
###MACBETH
Not yet. 
###MACDUFF
He commanded me to wake him up early. I’ve almost missed the time he requested. 
###MACBETH
I’ll bring you to him. 
###MACDUFF
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a trouble just the same. 
###MACBETH
The work we enjoy is not really work. This is the door. 
###MACDUFF
I’ll wake him, because that’s my job. 
## MACDUFF exits.
###LENNOX
Is the king leaving here today? 
###MACBETH
He is. He told us to arrange it. 
###LENNOX
The night has been chaotic. The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping. People are saying they heard cries of grief in the air, strange screams of death, and terrible voices predicting catastrophes that will usher in a woeful new age. The owl made noise all night. Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever. 
###MACBETH
It was a rough night. 
###LENNOX
I’m too young to remember anything like it. 
## MACDUFF enters, upset.
###MACDUFF
Oh, horror, horror, horror! This is beyond words and beyond belief! 
###MACBETH & LENNOX
What’s the matter? 
###MACDUFF
The worst thing imaginable has happened. A murderer has broken into God’s temple and stolen the life out of it. 
###MACBETH
What are you talking about? “The life”? 
###LENNOX
Do you mean the king? 
###MACDUFF
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself. What’s in there will make you freeze with horror. Don’t ask me to talk about it. Go look and then do the talking yourselves. 
## MACBETH and LENNOX exit.
Wake up, wake up! Ring the alarm bell. Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm! Wake up! Shake off sleep, which looks like death, and look at death itself! Get up, get up, and look at this image of doomsday! Malcolm! Banquo! Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror. Ring the bell. 
##A bell rings. LADY MACBETH enters.
###LADY MACBETH
What’s going on? Why is that terrifying trumpet calling together everyone who’s sleeping in the house? Speak up and tell me! 
###MACDUFF
Oh gentle lady, my news isn’t fit for your ears. If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it. 
## BANQUO enters.
Oh Banquo, Banquo, the king has been murdered! 
###LADY MACBETH
How horrible! What, in our own house? 
###BANQUO
It would be a terrible event no matter where it happened. Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so. 
## MACBETH and LENNOX reenter, with ROSS.
###MACBETH
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life. Because from this moment on, there is nothing worth living for. Everything is a sick joke. The graceful and renowned king is dead. The wine of life has been poured out, and only the dregs remain. 
## MALCOLM and DONALBAIN enter.
###DONALBAIN
What’s wrong? 
###MACBETH
You are, but you don’t know it yet. The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped. 
###MACDUFF
Your royal father is murdered. 
###MALCOLM
Who did it? 
###LENNOX
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it. Their hands and faces were all covered with blood. So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped. They stared at us in confusion. No one’s life should have been entrusted to them. 
###MACBETH
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them. 
###MACDUFF
What did you do that for? 
###MACBETH
Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once? Nobody can do that. The violent rage inspired by my love for Duncan caused me to act before I could think rationally and tell myself to pause. There was Duncan, his white skin all splattered with his precious blood. The gashes where the knives had cut him looked like wounds to nature itself. Then right next to him I saw the murderers, dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered in gore. Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it? 
###LADY MACBETH
Help me out of here, quickly! 
###MACDUFF
Take care of the lady. 
###MALCOLM
(speaking so that only DONALBAIN can hear) Why are we keeping quiet? The two of us have the most to say in this matter. 
###DONALBAIN
(speaking so that only MALCOLM can hear) What are we going to say here, where danger may be waiting to strike at us from anywhere? Let’s get out of here. We haven’t even begun to weep yet—but there will be time for that later. 
###MALCOLM
(speaking so that only DONALBAIN can hear) And the time hasn’t come yet for us to turn our deep grief into action. 
###BANQUO
Take care of the lady. 
## LADY MACBETH is carried out.
When we’re properly dressed for the cold, let’s meet and discuss this bloody crime to see if we can figure anything out. Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts. I’m putting myself in God’s hands, and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder. 
###MACDUFF
So will I. 
###ALL
So will we all. 
###MACBETH
Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall. 
###ALL
Agreed. 
##Everyone exits except MALCOLM and DONALBAIN.
###MALCOLM
What are you going to do? Let’s not stay here with them. It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none. I’m going to England. 
###DONALBAIN
I’ll go to Ireland. We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways. Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding daggers. Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us. 
###MALCOLM
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely. With that in mind, let’s get on our horses. We’d better not worry about saying polite good-byes; we should just get away quickly. There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore. 
##They exit.
## ROSS and an OLD MAN enter.
###OLD MAN
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well, and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things. But last night’s horrors make everything that came before seem like a joke. 
###ROSS
Ah yes, old man. You can see the skies. They look like they’re upset about what mankind has been doing, and they’re threatening the Earth with storms. The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun. Is it because night is so strong, or because day is so weak, that darkness covers the earth when it’s supposed to be light? 
###OLD MAN
It’s unnatural, just like the murder that has been committed. Last Tuesday a falcon was circling high in the sky, and it was caught and killed by an ordinary owl that usually goes after mice. 
###ROSS
And something else strange happened. Duncan’s horses, which are beautiful and swift and the best of their breed, suddenly turned wild and broke out of their stalls. Refusing to be obedient as usual, they acted like they were at war with mankind. 
###OLD MAN
They say the horses ate each other. 
###ROSS
I saw it with my own eyes. It was an amazing sight. Here comes the good Macduff. 
## MACDUFF enters.
How are things going now? 
###MACDUFF
Can’t you see for yourself? 
###ROSS
Does anyone know who committed this horrible crime? 
###MACDUFF
The servants Macbeth killed. 
###ROSS
It’s too bad he killed them. What good would it have done those men to kill Duncan? 
###MACDUFF
They were paid to betray their master. Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, have run away and fled, which makes them the prime suspects. 
###ROSS
Everything about this is unnatural! What a stupid ambition, causing a son to kill the father who supports him. Then it looks like Macbeth will become king. 
###MACDUFF
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned. 
###ROSS
Where is Duncan’s body? 
###MACDUFF
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors, where their bones are kept safe. 
###ROSS
Are you going to Scone? 
###MACDUFF
No, cousin, I’m going to Fife. 
###ROSS
Well, I’ll go to Scone. 
###MACDUFF
I hope things go well there. Good-bye! And let’s hope things don’t get worse. 
###ROSS
Farewell, old man. 
###OLD MAN
May God’s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good, and enemies into friends! 
##They all exit.
## BANQUO enters.
###BANQUO
Now you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the weird women promised you. And I suspect you cheated to win these titles. But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead. If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too. But shhh! I’ll shut up now. 
##A trumpet plays. MACBETH enters dressed as king, and LADY MACBETH enters dressed as queen, together with LENNOX, ROSS, LORDS, LADIES, and their attendants
###MACBETH
(indicating BANQUO) Here’s our most important guest. 
###LADY MACBETH
If we forgot him, our big celebration wouldn’t be complete, and that wouldn’t be any good. 
###MACBETH
(to BANQUO) Tonight we’re having a ceremonial banquet, and I want you to be there. 
###BANQUO
Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it. 
###MACBETH
Are you going riding this afternoon? 
###BANQUO
Yes, my good lord. 
###MACBETH
We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow. Are you riding far? 
###BANQUO
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner. Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset. 
###MACBETH
Don’t miss our feast. 
###BANQUO
My lord, I won’t miss it. 
###MACBETH
We hear that the princes, those murderers, have hidden in England and Ireland. They haven’t confessed to cruelly murdering their own father, and they’ve been making up strange lies to tell their hosts. But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both. Hurry up and get to your horse. Good-bye, until you return tonight. Is Fleance going with you? 
###BANQUO
Yes, my good lord. It’s time we hit the road. 
###MACBETH
I hope your horses are fast and surefooted. And with that, I send you to them. Farewell. 
## BANQUO exits.
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight. In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime. Until then, God be with you! 
##Everyone exits except MACBETH and a SERVANT 
(to the SERVANT) You there, let me have a word with you. Are those men waiting for me? 
###SERVANT
They’re waiting outside the palace gate, my lord. 
###MACBETH
Bring them to me. 
##The SERVANT exits.
To be the king is nothing if I’m not safe as the king. I’m very afraid of Banquo. There’s something noble about him that makes me fear him. He’s willing to take risks, and his mind never stops working. He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely. I’m not afraid of anyone but him. Around him, my guardian angel is frightened, just as Mark Antony’s angel supposedly feared Octavius Caesar. Banquo chided the witches when they first called me king, asking them to tell him his own future. Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings. They gave me a crown and a scepter that I can’t pass on. Someone outside my family will take these things away from me, since no son of mine will take my place as king. If this is true, then I’ve tortured my conscience and murdered the gracious Duncan for Banquo’s sons. I’ve ruined my own peace for their benefit. I’ve handed over my everlasting soul to the devil so that they could be kings. Banquo’s sons, kings! Instead of watching that happen, I will challenge fate to battle and fight to the death. Who’s there! 
##The SERVANT comes back in with two MURDERERS 
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you. 
##The SERVANT exits.
Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other? 
###FIRST MURDERER
It was yesterday, your highness. 
###MACBETH
Well, did you think about what I said? You should know that it was Banquo who made your lives hell for so long, which you always thought was my fault. But I was innocent. I showed you the proof at our last meeting. I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” 
###FIRST MURDERER
You explained it all. 
###MACBETH
I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting. Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook? Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever? 
###FIRST MURDERER
We are men, my lord. 
###MACBETH
Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me. Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick. I’ll be healthy when he is dead. 
###SECOND MURDERER
My lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world, and I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I do. 
###FIRST MURDERER
I’m the same. I’m so sick of bad luck and trouble that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it would either fix my life or end it once and for all. 
###MACBETH
You both know Banquo was your enemy. 
###BOTH MURDERERS
It’s true, my lord. 
###MACBETH
He’s my enemy too, and I hate him so much that every minute he’s alive it eats away at my heart. Since I’m king, I could simply use my power to get rid of him. But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in common whom I need, so I have to be able to moan and cry over his death in public even though I’ll be the one who had him killed. That’s why I need your help right now. I have to hide my real plans from the public eye for many important reasons. 
###SECOND MURDERER
We’ll do what you want us to, my lord. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Though our lives— 
###MACBETH
(interrupts him) I can see the determination in your eyes. Within the next hour I’ll tell you where to go and exactly when to strike. It must be done tonight, away from the palace. Always remember that I must be free from suspicion. For the plan to work perfectly, you must kill both Banquo and his son, Fleance, who keeps him company. Getting rid of Fleance is as important to me as knocking off Banquo. Each of you should make up your own mind about whether you’re going to do this. I’ll come to you soon. 
###BOTH MURDERERS
We have decided, my lord. We’re in. 
###MACBETH
I’ll call for you soon. Stay inside. 
##The MURDERERS exit.
The deal is closed. Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night. 
##He exits.
## LADY MACBETH and a SERVANT enter.
###LADY MACBETH
Has Banquo left the court? 
###SERVANT
Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight. 
###LADY MACBETH
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes. 
###SERVANT
No problem, madam. 
##The SERVANT exits.
###LADY MACBETH
If you get what you want and you’re still not happy, you’ve spent everything and gained nothing. It’s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety. 
## MACBETH enters.
What’s going on, my lord? Why are you keeping to yourself, with only your sad thoughts to keep you company? Those thoughts should have died when you killed the men you’re thinking about. If you can’t fix it, you shouldn’t give it a second thought. What’s done is done. 
###MACBETH
We have slashed the snake but not killed it. It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again. But the universe can fall apart, and heaven and earth crumble, before I’ll eat my meals in fear and spend my nights tossing and turning with these nightmares I’ve been having. I’d rather be dead than endure this endless mental torture and harrowing sleep deprivation. We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace. Duncan lies in his grave, through with life’s troubles, and he’s sleeping well. We have already done the worst we can do to him with our treason. After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else. 
###LADY MACBETH
Come on, relax, dear. Put on a happy face and look cheerful and agreeable for your guests tonight. 
###MACBETH
That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same. Give Banquo your special attention. Talk to him and look at him in a way that will make him feel important. We’re in a dangerous situation, where we have to flatter him and hide our true feelings. 
###LADY MACBETH
You have to stop talking like this. 
###MACBETH
Argh! I feel like my mind is full of scorpions, my dear wife. You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive. 
###LADY MACBETH
But they can’t live forever. 
###MACBETH
That’s comforting. They can be killed, it’s true. So be cheerful. Before the bat flies through the castle, and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done. 
###LADY MACBETH
What are you going to do? 
###MACBETH
It’s better you don’t know about it until after it’s done, when you can applaud it. (to the night) Come, night, and blindfold the kindhearted day. Use your bloody and invisible hand to tear up Banquo’s lease on life, which keeps me in fear. (to himself) The sky’s getting dark, and the crow is returning home to the woods. The gentle creatures of the day are falling asleep, while night’s predators are waking up to look for their prey. (to LADY MACBETH) You seem surprised at my words, but don’t question me yet. Bad deeds force you to commit more bad deeds. So please, come with me. 
##They exit.
##The two MURDERERS enter with a third MURDERER.
###FIRST MURDERER
But who told you to come here and join us? 
###THIRD MURDERER
Macbeth. 
###SECOND MURDERER
We can trust this guy. He was given exactly the same orders we were. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Then stay with us. There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky. Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns. Banquo is almost here. 
###THIRD MURDERER
Listen! I hear horses. 
###BANQUO
(from offstage) Hey, give us some light here! 
###SECOND MURDERER
That must be him. The rest of the king’s guests are already inside. 
###FIRST MURDERER
You can hear his horses moving around as the servants take them to the stables. 
###THIRD MURDERER
It’s almost a mile to the palace gate, but Banquo, like everybody else, usually walks from here to the palace. 
## BANQUO and FLEANCE enter with a torch.
###SECOND MURDERER
Here comes a light! Here comes a light! 
###THIRD MURDERER
That’s him. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Prepare yourselves. 
###BANQUO
It will rain tonight. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Then let the rain come down. 
##The MURDERERS attack BANQUO.
###BANQUO
Oh, this is treachery! Get out of here, good Fleance, run, run, run! Someday you can get revenge.—Oh, you bastard! 
## BANQUO dies. FLEANCE escapes.
###THIRD MURDERER
Who put out the light? 
###FIRST MURDERER
Wasn’t that the best thing to do? 
###THIRD MURDERER
There’s only one body here. The son ran away. 
###SECOND MURDERER
We failed in half of our mission. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Well, let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish. 
##They exit.
##The stage is set for a banquet. MACBETH enters with LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, LORDS, and their attendants.
###MACBETH
You know your own ranks, so you know where to sit. Sit down. From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome. 
##The LORDS sit down.
###LORDS
Thanks to your majesty. 
###MACBETH
I will walk around and mingle with all of you, playing the humble host. My wife will stay in her royal chair, but at the appropriate time I will have her welcome you all. 
###LADY MACBETH
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome. 
##The FIRST MURDERER appears at the door.
###MACBETH
And they respond to you with their hearts as well. The table is full on both sides. I will sit here in the middle. Be free and happy. Soon we will toast around the table. 
(approaching the door and speaking to the MURDERER) There’s blood on your face. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Then it must be Banquo’s. 
###MACBETH
I’d rather see his blood splattered on your face than flowing through his veins. Did you finish him off? 
###FIRST MURDERER
My lord, his throat is cut. I did that to him. 
###MACBETH
You are the best of the cutthroats. But whoever did the same to Fleance must also be good. If you cut both their throats, then you are the absolute best. 
###FIRST MURDERER
Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped. 
###MACBETH
Now I’m scared again. Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself. But now I’m all tangled up with doubts and fears. But Banquo’s been taken care of? 
###FIRST MURDERER
Yes, my good lord. He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which would have been enough to kill him. 
###MACBETH
Thanks for that. The adult snake lies in the ditch. The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening, but for now he has no fangs. Get out of here. I’ll talk to you again tomorrow. 
##The FIRST MURDERER exits.
###LADY MACBETH
My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests. If you don’t make your guests know they’re welcome, they’ll feel like they’re paying for their meal. When you just want to eat, it’s better to do that at home. When you’re eating out with people, you need to have a little more ceremony. Otherwise dinner parties would be boring. 
###MACBETH
It’s nice of you to remind me. (raising a glass to toast his guests) Since good digestion requires a good appetite, and good health requires both of those, here’s to good appetites, good digestion, and good health! 
###LENNOX
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness? 
##The GHOST OF BANQUO enters and sits in MACBETH’s place.
###MACBETH
We would have all the nobility of Scotland gathered under one roof, if only Banquo were here. I hope it turns out that he’s late out of rudeness, and not because something bad has happened to him. 
###ROSS
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir. If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company? 
###MACBETH
The table’s full. 
###LENNOX
Here’s an empty seat, sir. 
###MACBETH
Where? 
###LENNOX
(pointing to where the GHOST sits) Here, my good lord. What’s wrong, your highness? 
###MACBETH
(seeing the GHOST) Which one of you did this? 
###LORDS
What, my good lord? 
###MACBETH
(to the GHOST) You can’t say I did it. Don’t shake your bloody head at me. 
###ROSS
Gentlemen, stand up. His highness is not well. 
###LADY MACBETH
Sit down, worthy friends. My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child. Please stay seated. This is just a brief fit. In a moment he’ll be well again. If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer. Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him. (speaking so that only MACBETH can hear) Are you a man? 
###MACBETH
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil. 
###LADY MACBETH
Oh, that’s nonsense! This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid. This is like that floating dagger you said was leading you toward Duncan. These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear. They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother. Shame on you! Why are you making these faces? When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool. 
###MACBETH
Please, just look over there. Look! Look! See! (to the GHOST) What do you have to say? What do I care? If you can nod, then speak too. If the dead are going to return from their graves, then there’s nothing to stop the birds from eating the bodies. So there’s no point in our burying people. 
##The GHOST vanishes.
###LADY MACBETH
What, has your foolishness paralyzed you completely? 
###MACBETH
As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him. 
###LADY MACBETH
Nonsense! 
###MACBETH
In ancient times, before there were laws to make the land safe and peaceful, a lot of blood was spilled. Yes, and since then murders have been committed that are too awful to talk about. It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it. But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools. This haunting business is even stranger than murder. 
###LADY MACBETH
My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company. 
###MACBETH
I forgot about them. (to the guests) Don’t be alarmed on my account, my most worthy friends. I have a strange disorder, which no longer shocks those who know me well. (raising his glass to toast the company) Come, let’s drink a toast: love and health to you all. Now I’ll sit down. Give me some wine. Fill up my cup. 
##The GHOST OF BANQUO reappears in MACBETH’s seat.
I drink to the happiness of everyone at the table, and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. I wish he were here! Let’s drink to everyone here, and to Banquo. Now, everybody, drink 
###LORDS
Hear, hear. 
##They drink.
###MACBETH
(to the GHOST) Go! And get out of my sight! Stay in your grave. There’s no marrow in your bones, and your blood is cold. You’re staring at me with eyes that have no power to see. 
###LADY MACBETH
Good friends, think of this as nothing more than a strange habit. It’s nothing else. Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight. 
###MACBETH
I am as brave as any other man. Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor-plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran. Take any shape other than the one you have now and I will never tremble in fear. Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place. If I tremble then, you can call me a little girl. Get out of here, you horrible ghost, you hallucination. Get out! 
##The GHOST vanishes.
I am a man again. Pray you sit still. 
Look, now that it’s gone, I’m a man again. Please, remain seated. 
###LADY MACBETH
You have ruined our good cheer and disrupted the gathering by making a spectacle of yourself. 
###MACBETH
(to the guests) Can things like this happen so suddenly without making us all astonished? You make me feel like I don’t know myself, when I see you looking at these terrible things and keeping a straight face, while my face has gone white with fear. 
###ROSS
What things, my lord? 
###LADY MACBETH
Please, don’t speak to him. He’s getting worse and worse. Talk makes him crazy. Everybody, please leave right now. Don’t bother exiting in the order of your rank, but just leave right away. 
###LENNOX
Good night. I hope the king recovers soon! 
###LADY MACBETH
A kind good night to all! 
##Everyone leaves except MACBETH and LADY MACBETH.
###MACBETH
There’s an old saying: the dead will have their revenge. Gravestones have been known to move, and trees to speak, to bring guilty men to justice. The craftiest murderers have been exposed by the mystical signs made by crows and magpies. How late at night is it? 
###LADY MACBETH
It’s almost morning. You can’t tell whether it’s day or night. 
###MACBETH
What do you think about the fact that Macduff refuses to come to me when I command him? 
###LADY MACBETH
Did you send for him, sir? 
###MACBETH
I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him. In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me. Tomorrow, while it’s still early, I will go see the witches. They will tell me more, because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen. My own safety is the only important thing now. I have walked so far into this river of blood that even if I stopped now, it would be as hard to go back to being good as it is to keep killing people. I have some schemes in my head that I’m planning to put into action. I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them. 
###LADY MACBETH
You haven’t slept. 
###MACBETH
Yes, let’s go to sleep. My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience. We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime. 
##They exit.
##Thunder. The three WITCHES enter, meeting HECATE.
###FIRST WITCH
What’s wrong, Hecate? You look angry. 
###HECATE
Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags? How dare you give Macbeth riddles and prophecies about his future without telling me? I am your boss and the source of your powers. I am the one who secretly decides what evil things happen, but you never called me to join in and show off my own powers. And what’s worse, you’ve done all this for a man who behaves like a spoiled brat, angry and hateful. Like all spoiled sons, he chases after what he wants and doesn’t care about you. But you can make it up to me. Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell. Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny. You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms, and everything else. I’m about to fly away. I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen. I have a lot to do before noon. An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon. I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground. When I work it over with magic spells, the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions. 
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate, he will mock death, and he will think he is above wisdom, grace, and fear. As you all know, overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy. 
##Music plays offstage, and voices sing a song with the words “Come away, come away.”
Listen! I’m being called. Look, my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me. 
## HECATE exits.
###FIRST WITCH
Come on, let’s hurry. She’ll be back again soon. 
##They all exit.
## LENNOX and another LORD enter.
###LENNOX
What I’ve already said shows you we think alike, so you can draw your own conclusions. All I’m saying is that strange things have been going on. Macbeth pitied Duncan—after Duncan was dead. And Banquo went out walking too late at night. If you like, we can say that Fleance must have killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the crime. Clearly, men should not go out walking too late! And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father? Such a heinous crime—how it saddened Macbeth! Wasn’t it loyal of him to kill those two servants right away, while they were still drunk and asleep? That was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Yes, and it was the wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth has handled things well. If he had Duncan’s sons in prison—which I hope won’t happen—they would find out how awful the punishment is for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance. But enough of that. I hear that Macduff is out of favor with the king because he speaks his mind too plainly, and because he failed to show up at Macbeth’s feast. Can you tell me where he’s hiding himself? 
###LORD
Duncan’s son Malcolm, whose birthright and throne Macbeth has stolen, lives in the English court. There, the saintly King Edward treats Malcolm so well that despite Malcolm’s misfortunes, he’s not deprived of respect. Macduff went there to ask King Edward for help. He wants Edward to help him form an alliance with the people of Northumberland and their lord, Siward. Macduff hopes that with their help—and with the help of God above—he may once again put food on our tables, bring peace back to our nights, free our feasts and banquets from violent murders, allow us to pay proper homage to our king, and receive honors freely. Those are the things we pine for now. Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for war. 
###LENNOX
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland? 
###LORD
He did, but Macduff told the messenger, “No way.” The messenger scowled and rudely turned his back on Macduff, as if to say, “You’ll regret the day you gave me this answer.” 
###LENNOX
That might well keep Macduff away from Scotland. Some holy angel should go to the court of England and give Macduff a message. He should return quickly to free our country, which is suffering under a tyrant! 
###LORD
I’ll send my prayers with him. 
##They exit.
##A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder. The three WITCHES enter.
###FIRST WITCH
The tawny cat has meowed three times. 
###SECOND WITCH
Three times. And the hedgehog has whined once. 
###THIRD WITCH
My spirit friend, Harpier, is yelling, “It’s time, it’s time!” 
###FIRST WITCH
Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails. (holding up a toad) You’ll go in first—a toad that sat under a cold rock for a month, oozing poison from its pores. 
###ALL
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. 
###SECOND WITCH
(holding something up) We’ll boil you in the cauldron next—a slice of swamp snake. All the rest of you in too: a newt’s eye, a frog’s tongue, fur from a bat, a dog’s tongue, the forked tongue of an adder, the stinger of a burrowing worm, a lizard’s leg, an owl’s wing. (speaking to the ingredients) Make a charm to cause powerful trouble, and boil and bubble like a broth of hell. 
###ALL
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble. 
###THIRD WITCH
Here come some more ingredients: the scale of a dragon, a wolf’s tooth, a witch’s mummified flesh, the gullet and stomach of a ravenous shark, a root of hemlock that was dug up in the dark, a Jew’s liver, a goat’s bile, some twigs of yew that were broken off during a lunar eclipse, a Turk’s nose, a Tartar’s lips, the finger of a baby that was strangled as a prostitute gave birth to it in a ditch. (to the ingredients) Make this potion thick and gluey. (to the other WITCHES) Now let’s add a tiger’s entrails to the mix. 
###ALL
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble. 
###SECOND WITCH
We’ll cool the mixture with baboon blood. After that the charm is finished. 
## HECATE enters with three other WITCHES.
###HECATE
Well done! I admire your efforts, and all of you will share the rewards. Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies, enchanting everything you put in. 
##Music plays and the six WITCHES sing a song called “Black Spirits.” HECATE leaves.
###SECOND WITCH
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs. Doors, open up for whoever is knocking! 
## MACBETH enters.
###MACBETH
What’s going on here, you secret, evil, midnight hags? What are you doing? 
###ALL
Something there isn’t a word for. 
###MACBETH
I don’t know how you know the things you do, but I insist that you answer my questions. I command you in the name of whatever dark powers you serve. I don’t care if you unleash violent winds that tear down churches, make the foamy waves overwhelm ships and send sailors to their deaths, flatten crops and trees, make castles fall down on their inhabitants' heads, make palaces and pyramids collapse, and mix up everything in nature. Tell me what I want to know. 
###FIRST WITCH
Speak. 
###SECOND WITCH
Demand. 
###THIRD WITCH
We’ll answer. 
###FIRST WITCH
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master’s? 
###MACBETH
Call them. Let me see them. 
###FIRST WITCH
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring. Take the sweat of a murderer on the gallows and throw it into the flame. 
###ALL
Come, high or low spirits. Show yourself and what you do. 
##Thunder. The FIRST APPARITION appears, looking like a head with an armored helmet.
###MACBETH
Tell me, you unknown power— 
###FIRST WITCH
He can read your thoughts. Listen, but don’t speak. 
###FIRST APPARITION
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff. Beware the thane of Fife. Let me go. Enough. 
##The FIRST APPARITION descends.
###MACBETH
Whatever you are, thanks for your advice. You have guessed exactly what I feared. But one word more— 
###FIRST WITCH
He will not be commanded by you. Here’s another, stronger than the first. 
##Thunder. The SECOND APPARITION appears, looking like a bloody child.
###SECOND APPARITION
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! 
###MACBETH
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three. 
###SECOND APPARITION
Be violent, bold, and firm. Laugh at the power of other men, because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth. 
The SECOND APPARITION descends. 
###MACBETH
Then I don’t need to kill Macduff. I have no reason to fear him. But even so, I’ll make doubly sure. I’ll guarantee my own fate by having you killed, Macduff. That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night. 
##Thunder. The THIRD APPARITION appears, in the form of a child with a crown on his head and a tree in his hand.
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head? 
###ALL
Listen but don’t speak to it. 
###THIRD APPARITION
Be brave like the lion and proud. Don’t even worry about who hates you, who resents you, and who conspires against you. Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill. 
##The THIRD APPARITION descends.
###MACBETH
That will never happen. Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth? These were sweet omens! Good! My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves, and I will be king for my entire natural life. But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing. Tell me, if your dark powers can see this far: will Banquo’s sons ever reign in this kingdom? 
###ALL
Don’t try to find out more. 
###MACBETH
I demand to be satisfied. If you refuse, let an eternal curse fall on you. Let me know. Why is that cauldron sinking? And what is that music? 
##Hautboys play music for a ceremonial procession.
###FIRST WITCH
Show. 
###SECOND WITCH
Show. 
###THIRD WITCH
Show. 
###ALL
Show him and make him grieve. Come like shadows and depart in the same way! 
##Eight kings march across the stage, the last one with a mirror in his hand, followed by the GHOST OF BANQUO.
###MACBETH
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo. Go away!     (to the first) Your crown hurts my eyes. (to the second) Your blond hair, which looks like another crown underneath the one you’re wearing, looks just like the first king’s hair. Now I see a third king who looks just like the second. Filthy hags! Why are you showing me this? A fourth! My eyes are bulging out of their sockets! Will this line stretch on forever? Another one! And a seventh! I don’t want to see any more. And yet an eighth appears, holding a mirror in which I see many more men. And some are carrying double balls and triple scepters, meaning they’re kings of more than one country! Horrible sight! Now I see it is true, they are Banquo’s descendants. Banquo, with his blood-clotted hair, is smiling at me and pointing to them as his. 
##The spirits of the kings and the GHOST OF BANQUO vanish.
What? Is this true? 
###FIRST WITCH
Yes, this is true, but why do you stand there so dumbfounded? Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up and show him our talents. I will charm the air to produce music while you all dance around like crazy, so this king will say we did our duty and entertained him. 
##Music plays. The WITCHES dance and then vanish.
###MACBETH
Where are they? Gone? Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed. (calls to someone offstage) You outside, come in! 
## LENNOX enters.
###LENNOX
What does your grace want? 
###MACBETH
Did you see the weird sisters? 
###LENNOX
No, my lord. 
###MACBETH
Didn’t they pass by you? 
###LENNOX
No, indeed, my lord. 
###MACBETH
The air on which they ride is infected. Damn all those who trust them! I heard the galloping of horses. Who was it that came here? 
###LENNOX
Two or three men, my lord, who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England. 
###MACBETH
Fled to England? 
###LENNOX
Yes, my good lord. 
###MACBETH
Time, you thwart my dreadful plans. Unless a person does something the second he thinks of it, he’ll never get a chance to do it. From now on, as soon as I decide to do something I’m going to act immediately. In fact, I’ll start following up my thoughts with actions right now. I’ll raid Macduff’s castle, seize the town of Fife, and kill his wife, his children, and anyone else unfortunate enough to stand in line for his inheritance. No more foolish talk. I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose. But no more spooky visions!—Where are the messengers? Come, bring me to them. 
##They exit.
## LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS enter.
###LADY MACDUFF
What did he do that made him flee this land? 
###ROSS
You have to be patient, madam. 
###LADY MACDUFF
He had no patience. He was crazy to run away. Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away. 
###ROSS
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee. 
###LADY MACDUFF
How could it be wisdom! To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it! He doesn’t love us. He lacks the natural instinct to protect his family. Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest. His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love. And since it’s so unreasonable for him to run away, it has nothing to do with wisdom either. 
###ROSS
My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together. As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require. It’s not safe for me to say much more than this, but times are bad when people get denounced as traitors and don’t even know why. In times like these, we believe frightening rumors but we don’t even know what we’re afraid of. It’s like being tossed around on the ocean in every direction, and finally getting nowhere. I’ll say good-bye now. It won’t be long before I’m back. When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before. My young cousin, I put my blessing upon you. 
###LADY MACDUFF
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless. 
###ROSS
I have to go. If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying. I’m leaving now. 
## ROSS exits.
###LADY MACDUFF
Young man, your father’s dead. What are you going to do now? How are you going to live? 
###SON
I will live the way birds do, Mother. 
###LADY MACDUFF
What? Are you going to start eating worms and flies? 
###SON
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do. 
###LADY MACDUFF
You’d be a pitiful bird. You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps. 
###SON
Why should I be afraid of them, Mother? If I’m a pitiful bird, like you say, hunters won’t want me. No matter what you say, my father is not dead. 
###LADY MACDUFF
Yes, he is dead. What are you going to do for a father? 
###SON
Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a husband? 
###LADY MACDUFF
Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market. 
###SON
If so, you’d be buying them to sell again. 
###LADY MACDUFF
You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway. 
###SON
Was my father a traitor, Mother? 
###LADY MACDUFF
Yes, he was. 
###SON
What is a traitor? 
###LADY MACDUFF
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it. 
###SON
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor? 
###LADY MACDUFF
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged. 
###SON
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged? 
###LADY MACDUFF
Everyone. 
###SON
Who should hang them? 
###LADY MACDUFF
The honest men. 
###SON
Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them. 
###LADY MACDUFF
(laughing) Heaven help you for saying that, boy! (sad again) But what will you do without a father? 
###SON
If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him. If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father. 
###LADY MACDUFF
Silly babbler, how you talk! 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Bless you, fair lady! You don’t know me, but I know you’re an important person. I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you. If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives. Go away and take your children. I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm. And harm is getting close! Heaven keep you safe! 
##The MESSENGER exits.
###LADY MACDUFF
Where should I go? I haven’t done anything wrong. But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake. So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent? 
##The MURDERERS enter.
Who are these men? 
###FIRST MURDERER
Where is your husband? 
###LADY MACDUFF
I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him. 
###FIRST MURDERER
He’s a traitor. 
###SON
You’re lying, you shaggy-haired villain! 
###FIRST MURDERER
What’s that, you runt? (stabbing him) Young son of a traitor! 
###SON
He has killed me, Mother. Run away, I beg you! 
##The SON dies. LADY MACDUFF exits, crying “Murder!” The MURDERERS exit, following her.
## MALCOLM and MACDUFF enter.
###MALCOLM
Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out. 
###MACDUFF
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men. Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain. 
###MALCOLM
I will avenge whatever I believe is wrong. And I’ll believe whatever I’m sure is true. And I’ll put right whatever I can when the time comes. What you just said may perhaps be true. This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man. You were one of his favorites. He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet. I’m inexperienced, but maybe you’re planning to win Macbeth’s favor by betraying me to him. It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth. 
###MACDUFF
I am not treacherous. 
###MALCOLM
But Macbeth is. Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command. But I beg your pardon. My fears can’t actually make you evil. Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven. Even though everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good too. 
###MACDUFF
I have lost my hope of convincing you to fight against Macbeth. 
###MALCOLM
Maybe you lost your hopes about me where I found my doubts about you. Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious things in your life, those strong bonds of love? How could you leave them behind? But I beg you, don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against you. You must understand that I want to protect myself. You may really be honest, no matter what I think. 
###MACDUFF
Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyrant, go ahead and build yourself up, because good people are afraid to stand up to you. Enjoy everything you stole, because your title is safe! Farewell, lord. I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too. 
###MALCOLM
Don’t be offended. I don’t completely distrust you. I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression. Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds. I also think there would be many people willing to fight for me. The English have promised me thousands of troops. But even so, when I have Macbeth’s head under my foot, or stuck on the end of my sword, then my poor country will be plagued by worse evil than it was before. It will suffer worse and in more ways than ever under the reign of the king who follows Macbeth. 
###MACDUFF
Who are you talking about? 
###MALCOLM
I’m talking about myself. I know I have so many vices that when people see all of them exposed, evil Macbeth will seem as pure as snow in comparison, and poor Scotland will call him a sweet lamb when they compare him to me and my infinite evils. 
###MACDUFF
Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than Macbeth. 
###MALCOLM
I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name. But there is no end, absolutely none, to my sexual desires. Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust. My desire would overpower all restraints and anyone who stood in my way. It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me. 
###MACDUFF
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny. It has caused the downfall of many kings. But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you. You can find a way to satisfy your desires in secret, while still appearing virtuous. You can deceive everyone. There are more than enough willing women around. Your lust can’t possibly be so strong that you’d use up all the women willing to give themselves to the king once they find out he wants them. 
###MALCOLM
Along with being full of lust, I’m also incredibly greedy. If I became king, I would steal the nobles' lands, taking jewels from one guy and houses from another. The more I had, the greedier I would grow, until I’d invent false quarrels with my good and loyal subjects, destroying them so I could get my hands on their wealth. 
###MACDUFF
The greed you’re talking about is worse than lust because you won’t outgrow it. Greed has been the downfall of many kings. But don’t be afraid. Scotland has enough treasures to satisfy you out of your own royal coffers. These bad qualities are bearable when balanced against your good sides. 
###MALCOLM
But I don’t have any good sides. I don’t have a trace of the qualities a king needs, such as justice, truth, moderation, stability, generosity, perseverance, mercy, humility, devotion, patience, courage, and bravery. Instead, I overflow with every variation of all the different vices. No, if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell. 
###MACDUFF
Oh Scotland, Scotland! 
###MALCOLM
If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know. I really am exactly as I have described myself to you. 
###MACDUFF
(to MALCOLM) Fit to be king? You’re not fit to live!—Oh miserable nation, ruled by a usurping, murderous tyrant, when will you see peaceful days again? The man who has a legal right to the throne is, by his own admission, a cursed man and a disgrace to the royal family.—Your royal father Duncan was a virtuous king. Your mother spent more time on her knees in prayer than she did standing up, and she lived a life of absolute piety. Good-bye. The evils you have described inside yourself have driven me out of Scotland forever. Oh my heart, your hope is dead! 
###MALCOLM
Macduff, this passionate outburst, which proves your integrity, has removed my doubts about you and made me realize that you really are trustworthy and honorable. That devil Macbeth has tried many times to trick me and lure me into his power, and prudence prevents me from believing people too quickly. But with God as my witness, I will let myself be guided by you, and I take back my confession. I take back all the bad things I said about myself, because none of those flaws are really part of my character. I’m still a virgin. I have never told a lie. I barely care about what I already own, let alone feel jealous of another’s possessions. I have never broken a promise. I wouldn’t betray the devil himself. I love truth as much as I love life. The lies I told about my character are actually the first false words I have ever spoken. The person who I really am is ready to serve you and our poor country. 
Indeed, before you arrived here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle, was making his way here. Now we will fight Macbeth together, and may the chances of our success be as great as the justice of our cause! Why are you silent? 
###MACDUFF
It’s hard to make sense of such different stories. 
##A DOCTOR enters.
###MALCOLM
Well, we’ll speak more soon. (to the DOCTOR) Is King Edward coming out? 
###DOCTOR
Yes, sir. A crowd of sick people is waiting for him to heal them. Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine, but when he touches them, they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven. 
###MALCOLM
Thank you, doctor. 
##The DOCTOR exits.
###MACDUFF
What disease is he talking about? 
###MALCOLM
It’s called the evil. Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England. How he receives these gifts from heaven, only he can say. But he cures people with strange conditions—all swollen, plagued by ulcers, and pitiful to look at, patients who are beyond the help of surgery—by placing a gold coin around their necks and saying holy prayers over them. 
They say that he bequeaths this ability to heal to his royal descendants. Along with this strange power, he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities. All of these signs mark him as a man graced by God. 
## ROSS enters.
###MACDUFF
Who’s that coming over here? 
###MALCOLM
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I don’t recognize him. 
###MACDUFF
My noble kinsman, welcome. 
###MALCOLM
I recognize him now. May God alter the circumstances that keep us apart! 
###ROSS
Hello, sir. 
###MACDUFF
Is Scotland the same as when I left it? 
###ROSS
Alas, our poor country! It’s too frightened to look at itself. Scotland is no longer the land where we were born; it’s the land where we’ll die. Where no one ever smiles except for the fool who knows nothing. Where sighs, groans, and shrieks rip through the air but no one notices. Where violent sorrow is a common emotion. When the funeral bells ring, people no longer ask who died. Good men die before the flowers in their caps wilt. They die before they even fall sick. 
###MACDUFF
Oh, your report is too poetic, but it sounds so true! 
###MALCOLM
What is the most recent news? 
###ROSS
Even news an hour old is old news. Every minute another awful thing happens. 
###MACDUFF
How is my wife? 
###ROSS
She’s well. 
###MACDUFF
And all my children? 
###ROSS
They’re well too. 
###MACDUFF
Macbeth hasn’t attacked them? 
###ROSS
They were at peace when I left them. 
###MACDUFF
Don’t be stingy with your words. What’s the news? 
###ROSS
While I was coming here to tell you my sad news, I heard rumors that many good men are arming themselves to rebel against Macbeth. When I saw Macbeth’s army on the move, I knew the rumors must be true. Now is the time when we need your help. Your presence in Scotland would inspire people to fight. Even the women would fight to rid themselves of Macbeth’s oppression. 
###MALCOLM
Let them be comforted—I’m returning to Scotland. Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers. There is no soldier more experienced or successful than Siward in the entire Christian world. 
###ROSS
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own. But I have some news that should be howled in a barren desert where nobody can hear it. 
###MACDUFF
What is this news about? Does it affect all of us? Or just one of us? 
###ROSS
No decent man can keep from sharing in the sorrow, but my news affects you alone. 
###MACDUFF
If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me. Let me have it now. 
###ROSS
I hope you won’t hate me forever after I say these things, because I will soon fill your ears with the most dreadful news you have ever heard. 
###MACDUFF
I think I can guess what you’re about to say. 
###ROSS
Your castle was attacked. Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered. If I told you how they were killed, it would cause you so much pain that it would kill you too, and add your body to the pile of murdered corpses. 
###MALCOLM
Merciful heaven! (to MACDUFF) Come on, man, don’t keep your grief hidden. Put your sorrow into words. The grief you keep inside you will whisper in your heart until it breaks. 
###MACDUFF
They killed my children too? 
###ROSS
They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they could find. 
###MACDUFF
And I had to be away! My wife was killed too? 
###ROSS
I said she was. 
###MALCOLM
Take comfort. Let’s cure this awful grief by taking revenge on Macbeth. 
###MACDUFF
He doesn’t have children. All my pretty little children? Did you say all? Oh, that bird from hell! All of them? What, all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop? 
###MALCOLM
Fight it like a man. 
###MACDUFF
I will. But I also have to feel it like a man. I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me. Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help? Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you! As wicked as I am, they were slaughtered because of me, not because of anything they did. May God give their souls rest. 
###MALCOLM
Let this anger sharpen your sword. Transform your grief into anger. Don’t block the feelings in your heart; let them loose as rage. 
###MACDUFF
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them! But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting. Bring me face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland. Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he escapes, may heaven forgive him as well! 
###MALCOLM
Now you sound like a man. Come on, let’s go see King Edward. The army is ready. All we have to do now is say goodbye to the king. Macbeth is ripe for the picking. We’ll be acting as God’s agents. Cheer up as much as you can. A new day will come at last. 
##They exit.
##A DOCTOR and a waiting- GENTLEWOMANThe waiting-gentlewoman is an upperclass woman whose job is to wait on the queen.GENTLEWOMAN enter.
###DOCTOR
I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about. When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking? 
###GENTLEWOMAN
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time. 
###DOCTOR
It’s unnatural to be asleep and act as if you’re awake. When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything? 
###GENTLEWOMAN
She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you. 
###DOCTOR
You can tell me. You really should. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech. 
## LADY MACBETH enters, holding a candle.
Look, here she comes! This is exactly how she always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep. Watch her. Keep hidden. 
###DOCTOR
How did she get that candle? 
###GENTLEWOMAN
It stands by her bedside. She always has to have a light next to her. Those are her orders. 
###DOCTOR
You see, her eyes are open. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
Yes, but they don’t see anything. 
###DOCTOR
What’s she doing now? Look how she rubs her hands. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
She often does that. She looks like she’s washing her hands. I’ve seen her do that before for as long as fifteen minutes. 
###LADY MACBETH
There’s still a spot here. 
###DOCTOR
Listen! She’s talking. I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better. 
###LADY MACBETH
(rubbing her hands) Come out, damned spot! Out, I command you! One, two. OK, it’s time to do it now.—Hell is murky!—Nonsense, my lord, nonsense! You are a soldier, and yet you are afraid? Why should we be scared, when no one can lay the guilt upon us?—But who would have thought the old man would have had so much blood in him? 
###DOCTOR
Did you hear that? 
###LADY MACBETH
The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that. You’ll ruin everything by acting startled like this. 
###DOCTOR
Now look what you’ve done. You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that. Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping. 
###LADY MACBETH
I still have the smell of blood on my hand. All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better. Oh, oh, oh! 
###DOCTOR
What a heavy sigh! Her heart is carrying a heavy weight. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen. 
###DOCTOR
Well, well, well. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir! 
###DOCTOR
This disease is beyond my medical skills. But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything. 
###LADY MACBETH
Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Don’t look so frightened. I tell you again, Banquo is buried. He cannot come out of his grave. 
###DOCTOR
Is this true? 
###LADY MACBETH
To bed, to bed! There’s a knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed! 
## LADY MACBETH exits.
###DOCTOR
Will she go to bed now? 
###GENTLEWOMAN
Yes, right away. 
###DOCTOR
Evil rumors are going around. Unnatural acts will cause supernatural things to happen. People with guilty and deranged minds will confess their secrets to their pillows as they sleep. This woman needs a priest more than a doctor. God forgive us all! (to the waiting- GENTLEWOMAN) Look after her. Remove anything she might hurt herself with. Watch her constantly. And now, good-night. She has bewildered my mind and amazed my eyes. I have an opinion, but I don’t dare to say it out loud. 
###GENTLEWOMAN
Good night, good doctor. 
##They exit.
## MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and soldiers enter with a drummer and flag.
###MENTEITH
The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff. They burn for revenge. The wrongs they have suffered would make dead men rise up and fight. 
###ANGUS
We’ll meet them near Birnam Wood. They are coming that way. 
###CAITHNESS
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother? 
###LENNOX
He is definitely not there, sir. I have a list of all the important men. Siward’s son is there, as well as many boys too young to have beards who will become men by joining in this battle. 
###MENTEITH
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing? 
###CAITHNESS
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses. Some say he’s insane. Those who hate him less call it brave anger. One thing is certain: he’s out of control. 
###ANGUS
Now Macbeth feels the blood of his murdered enemies sticking to his hands. Now, rebel armies punish him every minute for his treachery. The soldiers he commands are only following orders. They don’t fight because they love Macbeth. Now he seems too small to be a great king, like a midget trying to wear the robes of a giant. 
###MENTEITH
Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done? 
###CAITHNESS
Well, let’s keep marching and give our loyalty to someone who truly deserves it. We’re going to meet Malcolm, the doctor who will cure our sick country. We’ll pour out our own blood to help him. 
###LENNOX
However much blood we need to give to water the royal flower and drown the weeds—to make Malcolm king and get rid of Macbeth. Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam. 
##They exit, marching.
## MACBETH, a DOCTOR, and attendants enter.
###MACBETH
Don’t bring me any more reports. I don’t care if all the thanes desert me. Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear. What’s the boy Malcolm? Wasn’t he born from a woman? The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth. No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English! My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear. 
##A SERVANT enters.
May the devil turn you black, you white-faced fool! Why do you look like a frightened goose? 
###SERVANT
There are ten thousand— 
###MACBETH
Geese, you idiot? 
###SERVANT
Soldiers, sir. 
###MACBETH
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face, you cowardly boy. What soldiers, fool? Curse you! That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well. What soldiers, milk-face? 
###SERVANT
The English army, sir. 
###MACBETH
Get out of my sight. 
##The SERVANT exits.
Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne. I have lived long enough. The course of my life is beginning to wither and fall away, like a yellowing leaf in autumn. The things that should go along with old age, like honor, love, obedience, and loyal friends, I cannot hope to have. Instead, I have passionate but quietly whispered curses, people who honor me with their words but not in their hearts, and lingering life, which my heart would gladly end, though I can’t bring myself to do it. Seyton! 
## SEYTON enters.
###SEYTON
What do you want? 
###MACBETH
Is there more news? 
###SEYTON
All the rumors have been confirmed. 
###MACBETH
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones. Give me my armor. 
###SEYTON
You don’t need it yet. 
###MACBETH
I’ll put it on anyway. Send out more cavalry. Scour the whole country and hang anyone spreading fear. Give me my armor. (to the DOCTOR) How is my wife, doctor? 
###DOCTOR
She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping. 
###MACBETH
Cure her of that. Can’t you treat a diseased mind? Take away her memory of sorrow? Use some drug to erase the troubling thoughts from her brain and ease her heart? 
###DOCTOR
For that kind of relief, the patient must heal herself. 
###MACBETH
Medicine is for the dogs. I won’t have anything to do with it. (to SEYTON) Come, put my armor on me. Give me my lance. Seyton, send out the soldiers. (to the DOCTOR) Doctor, the thanes are running away from me. (to SEYTON) Come on, sir, hurry. (to the DOCTOR) Can you figure out what’s wrong with my country? If you can diagnose its disease by examining its urine, and bring it back to health, I will praise you to the ends of the Earth, where the sound will echo back so you can hear the applause again.—(to SEYTON) Pull it off, I tell you. (to the DOCTOR) What drug would purge the English from this country? Have you heard of any? 
###DOCTOR
Yes, my good lord. Your preparation for war sounds like something. 
###MACBETH
(to SEYTON) Bring the armor and follow me. I will not be afraid of death and destruction until Birnam forest picks itself up and moves to Dunsinane. 
###DOCTOR
(to himself) I wish I were far away from Dunsinane. You couldn’t pay me to come back here. 
##They exit.
## MALCOLM, old SIWARD and his SON, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and SOLDIERS enter marching, with a drummer and flag.
###MALCOLM
Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms. 
###MENTEITH
We don’t doubt it. 
###SIWARD
What’s the name of this forest behind us? 
###MENTEITH
Birnam Wood. 
###MALCOLM
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him. That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports. 
###SOLDIERS
We’ll do it. 
###SIWARD
We have no news except that the overconfident Macbeth is still in Dunsinane and will allow us to lay siege to the castle. 
###MALCOLM
He wants us to lay siege. Wherever his soldiers have an opportunity to leave him, they do, whatever rank they are. No one fights with him except men who are forced to, and their hearts aren’t in it. 
###MACDUFF
We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal. Let’s go fight like hardworking soldiers. 
###SIWARD
Soon we’ll find out what’s really ours and what isn’t. It’s easy for us to get our hopes up just sitting around thinking about it, but the only way this is really going to be settled is by violence. So let’s move our armies forward. 
##They exit, marching.
## MACBETH, SEYTON, and SOLDIERS enter with a drummer and flag.
###MACBETH
Hang our flags on the outer walls. Everyone keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige. They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease. If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England. 
##A sound of women crying offstage.
What’s that noise? 
###SEYTON
It’s women crying, my good lord. 
## SEYTON exits.
###MACBETH
I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like. There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story. But now I’ve had my fill of real horrors. Horrible things are so familiar that they can’t startle me. 
## SEYTON comes back in.
What was that cry for? 
###SEYTON
The queen is dead, my lord. 
###MACBETH
She would have died later anyway. That news was bound to come someday. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. The days creep slowly along until the end of time. And every day that’s already happened has taken fools that much closer to their deaths. Out, out, brief candle. Life is nothing more than an illusion. It’s like a poor actor who struts and worries for his hour on the stage and then is never heard from again. Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
You’ve come to tell me something. Tell me quickly. 
###MESSENGER
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it. 
###MACBETH
Just say it. 
###MESSENGER
As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move. 
###MACBETH
Liar and slave! 
###MESSENGER
Punish me if it’s not true. Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest. 
###MACBETH
If you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger. If what you say is true, you can do the same to me. (to himself) My confidence is failing. I’m starting to doubt the lies the devil told me, which sounded like truth. “Don’t worry until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.” And now a wood is coming to Dunsinane. Prepare for battle, and go! If what this messenger says is true, it’s no use running away or staying here. I’m starting to grow tired of living, and I’d like to see the world plunged into chaos. Ring the alarms! Blow, wind! Come, ruin! At least we’ll die with our armor on. 
##They exit.
## MALCOLM, old SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their army enter carrying branches, with a drummer and flag.
###MALCOLM
We’re close enough now. Throw down these branches and show them who you really are. Uncle Siward, you and your son will lead the first battle. Brave Macduff and I will do the rest, according to our battle plan. 
###SIWARD
Good luck. If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight. 
###MACDUFF
Blow all the trumpets. They loudly announce the news of blood and death. 
##They exit.
##Trumpets and the noise of battle. MACBETH enters.
###MACBETH
They have me tied to a stake. I can’t run away. I have to stand and fight, like a bear.Where’s the man who wasn’t born from a woman? He’s the only one I’m afraid of, nobody else. 
## YOUNG SIWARD enters.
###YOUNG SIWARD
What’s your name? 
###MACBETH
You’ll be afraid to hear it. 
###YOUNG SIWARD
No I won’t, even if you were one of the worst demons in hell. 
###MACBETH
My name’s Macbeth. 
###YOUNG SIWARD
The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more. 
###MACBETH
No, nor could the devil’s name be more frightening. 
###YOUNG SIWARD
You lie, you disgusting tyrant. I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you. 
##They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is killed.
###MACBETH
You were born from a woman. Swords don’t frighten me. I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman. 
## MACBETH exits.
##Trumpets and battle sounds. MACDUFF enters.
###MACDUFF
The noise is coming from over there. Tyrant, show your face! If someone other than me kills you, the ghosts of my wife and children will haunt me forever. I can’t be bothered to fight these lame soldiers who only fight for money. I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused. You must be over there. By the great noise, it sounds like one of the highest-ranking men is being announced. I hope I find him! I ask for nothing more than that. 
## MACDUFF exits. More battle noises.
## MALCOLM and old SIWARD enter.
###SIWARD
Come this way, my lord. The castle has been surrendered without a fight. Macbeth’s soldiers are fighting on both sides. Our noblemen are battling bravely. The victory is almost yours, and it seems like there’s not much left to do. 
###MALCOLM
Our enemies fight as if they’re trying not to hurt us. 
###SIWARD
Sir, enter the castle. 
##They exit. Battle noises continue.
## MACBETH enters.
###MACBETH
Why should I commit suicide like one of the ancient Romans? As long as I see enemies of mine alive, I would rather see my sword wound them than me. 
## MACDUFF enters.
###MACDUFF
Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around! 
###MACBETH
You are the only man I have avoided. But go away now. I’m already guilty of killing your whole family. 
###MACDUFF
I have nothing to say to you. My sword will talk for me. You are too evil for words! 
##They fight.
###MACBETH
You’re wasting your time trying to wound me. You might as well try to stab the air with your sword. Go fight someone who can be harmed. I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman. 
###MACDUFF
You can forget about your charm. The evil spirit you serve can tell you that I was not born. They cut me out of my mother’s womb before she could bear me naturally. 
###MACBETH
Curse you for telling me this. You’ve fightened away my courage. I don’t believe those evil creatures anymore. They tricked me with their wordgames, raising my hopes and then destroying them. I won’t fight you. 
###MACDUFF
Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals. We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come see the tyrant!” 
###MACBETH
I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people. Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end. I’ll put up my shield and battle you. Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop! Enough!' 
##They exit fighting. Trumpets and battle noises. The trumpet of one army sounds a call to retreat. The other army’s trumpet sounds a call of victory. The victorious army enters, led by MALCOLM, old SIWARD, ROSS, the other THANES, and soldiers, with a drummer and flag.
###MALCOLM
I wish all of our friends could have survived this battle. 
###SIWARD
In every battle, some people will always be killed, but judging from the men I see around us, our great victory didn’t cost us very much. 
###MALCOLM
Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son. 
###ROSS
My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death. He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died. 
###SIWARD
So he’s dead? 
###ROSS
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field. Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end. 
###SIWARD
Were his wounds on his front side? 
###ROSS
Yes, on his front. 
###SIWARD
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now! If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did. And that’s all there is to it. 
###MALCOLM
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him. 
###SIWARD
He is worth no more than that. They tell me he died well, and settled his scores. With that, I hope God is with him! Here comes better news. 
## MACDUFF enters, carrying MACBETH’s head.
###MACDUFF
Hail, king! Because that’s what you are now. Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head. We are free from his tyranny. I see that you have the kingdom’s noblemen around you, and they’re thinking the same thing as me. I want them to join me in this loud cheer, Hail, King of Scotland! 
###ALL
Hail, King of Scotland! 
##Trumpets play.
###MALCOLM
It won’t be long before I reward each of you as he deserves. My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had. We have a lot to do at the dawn of this new era. We must call home all of our exiled friends who fled from the grip of Macbeth’s tyranny, and we must bring to justice all the evil ministers of this dead butcher and his demon-like queen, who, rumor has it, committed suicide. This, and whatever else we are called to do by God, we will do at the right time and in the right place. So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone. 
##Trumpets play. They all exit.

## KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND enter.
###KENT
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall. 
###GLOUCESTER
We used to think so too. But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more. He’s split the kingdom so evenly that it’s impossible to see any indication of favoritism. 
###KENT
(pointing to EDMUND) Isn’t this your son, my lord? 
###GLOUCESTER
Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing. I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment. 
###KENT
I can’t conceive of what you mean. 
###GLOUCESTER
You can’t conceive? Well, this guy’s mother could conceive him all to well. She grew a big belly and had a baby for her crib before she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell something naughty? 
###KENT
Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well. 
###GLOUCESTER
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard. Edmund may have snuck into the world a little before his time, but his mother was pretty, we had a fun time making him, and now I have to acknowledge the guy as my son.—Do you know this gentleman, Edmund? 
###EDMUND
No, I don’t, my lord. 
###GLOUCESTER
(to EDMUND) This is Lord Kent. Remember him as my friend and an honorable man. 
###EDMUND
Very pleased to meet you, my lord. 
###KENT
I look forward to getting to know you better. 
###EDMUND
I’ll try to make myself worth your knowledge. 
###GLOUCESTER
He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon. 
##Trumpets announce the arrival of King LEAR.
The king is coming. 
##A man bearing a crown enters, followed by KING LEAR, the Dukes of CORNWALL and ALBANY, then GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and attendants.
###LEAR
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester. 
###GLOUCESTER
Yes, my lord. 
##GLOUCESTER exits.
###LEAR
In the meantime I’ll get down to my real business.—Hand me that map over there.—I hereby announce that I’ve divided my kingdom into three parts, which I’m handing over to the younger generation so I can enjoy a little rest and peace of mind in my old age.—Cornwall and Albany, my loving sons-in-law, I now want to announce publicly what each of my daughters will inherit, to avoid hostilities after I die. The two 
great princes of France and Burgundy, vying for the hand of my youngest Cordelia, have been at my court a long time and will soon have their answers.—My daughters, since I’m about to give up my throne and the worries that go along with it, tell me which one of you loves me most, so that I can give my largest gift to the one who deserves it most.—Goneril, my oldest daughter, you speak first. 
###GONERIL
Sir, I love you more than words can say. I love you more than eyesight, space, and freedom, beyond wealth or anything of value. I love you as much as life itself, and as much as status, health, beauty, or honor. I love you as much as any child has ever loved her father, with a love too deep to be spoken of. I love you more than any answer to the question “How much?” 
###CORDELIA
(to herself) What will I say? I can only love and be silent. 
###LEAR
I give you all this land, from this line to that one—dense forests, fertile fields, rivers rich with fish, wide meadows. This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say? Tell me. 
###REGAN
Sir, I’m made of the same stuff as my sister and consider myself just as good as she is. She’s described my feelings of love for you precisely, but her description falls a little short of the truth. I reject completely any 
joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy. 
###CORDELIA
(to herself) Poor me, what am I going to say now? But I’m not poor in love—my love is bigger than my words are. 
###LEAR
You and your heirs hereby receive this large third of our lovely kingdom, no smaller in area or value than what I gave Goneril.—Now, you, my youngest daughter, my joy, courted by the rich rulers of France and Burgundy, what can you tell me that will make me give you a bigger part of my kingdom than I gave your sisters? Speak. 
###CORDELIA
Nothing, my lord. 
###LEAR
Nothing? 
###CORDELIA
Nothing. 
###LEAR
Come on, “nothing” will get you nothing. Try again. 
###CORDELIA
I’m unlucky. I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words. I love you as a child should love her father, neither more nor less. 
###LEAR
What are you saying, Cordelia? Revise your statement, or you may damage your inheritance. 
###CORDELIA
My lord, you brought me up and loved me, and I’m giving back just as I should: I obey you, love you, and 
honor you. How can my sisters speak the truth when they say they love only you? Don’t they love their husbands too? Hopefully when I get married, I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty. I’m sure I’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married, loving their father only. 
###LEAR
But do you mean what you’re saying? 
###CORDELIA
Yes, my lord. 
###LEAR
So young and so cruel? 
###CORDELIA
So young, my lord, and honest. 
###LEAR
Then that’s the way it’ll be. The truth will be all the inheritance you get. I swear by the sacred sun, by the mysterious moon, and by all the planets that rule our lives, that I disown you now as my daughter. As of now, there are no family ties between us, and I consider you a stranger to me. Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you, ex-daughter of mine. 
###KENT
But sir— 
###LEAR
Be quiet, Kent. Don’t get in my way when I’m angry. I loved Cordelia most of all and planned to spend my old age with her taking care of me. (to CORDELIA) Go 
away! Get out of my sight!—I guess if she doesn’t love her father, then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead.—Call the King of France. Why is nobody doing anything? Call the Duke of Burgundy. 
##Several attendants exit.
Cornwall and Albany, you and your wives can divide this last third of my kingdom between you. If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride. I hereby grant to you two my crown and all the privileges that kingship brings. I’ll live one month with one of you, the next month with the other one. All I ask is that you provide me with a hundred knights for my own entourage. I’ll keep only the title of king, but you’ll have everything else: all the authority and income that come with kingship. To confirm all this, take this crown to share between yourselves. (he gives CORNWALL and ALBANY the crown) 
###KENT
King Lear, I’ve always honored you as king, loved you as my father, obeyed you as my master, and thanked you in my prayers— 
###LEAR
I’m furious and ready to snap. Stay away or else I’ll take my anger out on you. 
###KENT
Let your anger fall on me then, even if its sharpness pierces my heart. Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad. What are you doing, old man? When powerful kings cave in to flatterers, do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it? When a majestic king starts acting silly, then it’s my duty to be blunt. 
Hold on to your crown and use your better judgment to rethink this rash decision. On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least. A loud mouth often points to an empty heart, and just because she’s quiet doesn’t mean she’s unloving. 
###LEAR
Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking. 
###KENT
I never considered my life as anything more than a chess pawn for you to play off against your enemies. I’m not afraid to lose it if it helps protect you. 
###LEAR
Get out of my sight! 
###KENT
Learn to see better, Lear, and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice. 
###LEAR
Now, I swear by Apollo… 
###KENT
By Apollo, King, you’re taking the names of the gods in vain. 
###LEAR
Oh, you lowlife! Scum! 
###ALBANY, CORNWALL
Please stop, sir. 
###KENT
Sure, kill the doctor who’s trying to cure you and pay your disease. Take back your gift to Albany and Cornwall. If you don’t, then as long as I’m able to speak I’ll keep telling you you’ve done a bad, bad thing. 
###LEAR
Listen to me, you traitor. You’ll pay the price for trying to make me go back on the vow I made when I bequeathed my kingdom to them. I’ve never broken a vow yet. You tried to make me revise my judgment on my youngest daughter, disrespecting my power as 
king—which I can’t put up with either as a ruler or as a person. This is your punishment: I’ll give you five days to gather together what you need to survive, then on the sixth day you’ll leave this kingdom that hates you. If the day after that you’re found in my kingdom, you die. Now get out of here! I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment. 
###KENT
Farewell, King. If this is how you act, it’s clear that freedom has been banished from this kingdom.(to CORDELIA) I hope the gods will protect you, my dear girl, for thinking fairly and speaking correctly. (to REGAN and GONERIL) And you two, I hope your actions carry out your grand promises of love, so that big words can bring big results. Farewell to all of you. I’ll carry on my old life in a new land. 
## KENT exits.
##Trumpets play. GLOUCESTER enters with the King of FRANCE, the Duke of BURGUNDY, and attendants.
###GLOUCESTER
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy, my lord. 
###LEAR
My lord the ruler of Burgundy, I’ll speak to you first. You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter. What’s the least that you will settle for as a dowry? 
###BURGUNDY
Your highness, I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered. I know you’ll offer nothing less than that. 
###LEAR
Burgundy, I valued her highly when I cared about her. But now her price has fallen. There she is, over there. If there’s anything you like about that worthless little thing, then go for it. She’s all yours. But what you see is what you get—her only dowry is my disapproval. There she is. 
###BURGUNDY
I don’t know what to say. 
###LEAR
She’s got big flaws. She has no friends or protectors. I no longer love her. Her only dowry is my curse and banishment. So do you take her or leave her? 
###BURGUNDY
I’m sorry, sir, but nobody can make a choice like this in such circumstances. 
###LEAR
Then leave her, sir. I swear to God she’s not worth anything more than what I told you. (to FRANCE) And as for you, great King of France, I’d never insult our friendship by encouraging you to marry a girl I hate. So I beg you to look around for a better match than this wretched creature that you can barely call human. 
###FRANCE
This is very odd. Until very recently she was your favorite, the object of all your praise and the delight of your old age. It’s strange that someone so dear to you could do anything so horrible as to warrant this sudden 
hatred. Her crime must be extreme and monstrous, or else your earlier love for her wasn’t as true as it seemed. But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible. 
###CORDELIA
(to LEAR) Please, your majesty, I don’t have a glib way with words and I only say what I mean. If I decide to do something, then I do it instead of talking about it. So I beg your majesty to let people know that it wasn’t because I did something atrocious that I fell from your favor. I didn’t murder or commit any immoral or lustful act. I’m out of favor simply because I’m not a fortune-hunter and I don’t have a smooth way with words—and I’m a better person because of it, even though it has cost me your love. 
###LEAR
Enough. It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did. 
###FRANCE
You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady? Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters. Will you marry her? She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be. 
###BURGUNDY
(to LEAR) King, just give me the dowry you promised me, and I’ll make Cordelia the Duchess of Burgundy right away. 
###LEAR
No, I’ll give nothing. I won’t budge on that. 
###BURGUNDY
(to CORDELIA) In that case, I’m sorry you have to lose me as a husband because you lost the king as a father. 
###CORDELIA
Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy. Since you love money and power so much, I won’t be your wife. 
###FRANCE
Beautiful Cordelia, you’re all the richer now that you’re poor. You’re more valuable now that you’re rejected and more loved now that you’re hated. I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away. It’s so strange that in neglecting you so cruelly, the gods have made me love you so dearly.—King, the daughter you’ve rejected is now mine, as Queen of France. No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you. You’ll find a much better place in France than what you’re giving up here. 
###LEAR
She’s yours, King of France. Take her. She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again. (to CORDELIA) So get out of here. Leave without any blessing or love from me.—Come with me, Burgundy. 
##Trumpets play.
##Everyone exits except FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA.
###FRANCE
Say goodbye to your sisters. 
###CORDELIA
Sisters, you whom our father loves so dearly, I leave you now with tears in my eyes. I know you for what you really are, but as your sister I’m reluctant to criticize you. Take good care of our father and show him the love that you have professed. I leave him in your care—but oh, if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him. Goodbye to you both. 
###REGAN
Don’t tell us what our duty is. 
###GONERIL
You should focus instead on pleasing your husband, who’s taken you in as an act of charity. You’ve failed to obey your father and you deserve to be deprived of everything that’s been taken away from you. 
###CORDELIA
Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve. You can be deceitful in the short term, but eventually truth will come out. Have a good life. 
###FRANCE
Come with me, my dear Cordelia. 
## FRANCE and CORDELIA exit.
###GONERIL
Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both. I think that our father will leave here tonight. 
###REGAN
Yes, I’m sure he will—to stay with you. Next month he’ll stay with us. 
###GONERIL
He’s so flighty in his old age, as we keep noticing. He has always loved Cordelia best, and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious. 
###REGAN
He’s going senile. But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well. 
###GONERIL
Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life. Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age. 
###REGAN
We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent. 
###GONERIL
There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony. Let’s put our heads together. If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us. 
###REGAN
We’ll have to think about it carefully. 
###GONERIL
We have to strike while the iron’s hot. 
##They exit.
## EDMUND enters with a letter.
###EDMUND
I only worship what’s natural, not what’s manmade. Why should I let myself be tortured by manmade social customs that deprive me of my rights simply because I was born twelve or fourteen months later than my older brother? Why do they call me “bastard” and “lowlife” when I’m just as gifted in mind and body as legitimate children? Why do they call us bastards “lowlifes”? Always “lowlife,” “bastard,” “lowlife,” “lowlife.” At least we bastards were conceived in a moment of passionate lust rather than in a dull, tired marriage bed, where half-sleeping parents monotonously churn out a bunch of sissy kids. All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands. Our father loves me just as much as the legitimate Edgar. What a nice word that is, “legitimate”! Well, my legitimate Edgar, if this letter works and my plan succeeds, Edmund the lowlife will beat the legitimate. Look out, I’m on my way up. Three cheers for bastards! 
## GLOUCESTER enters. EDMUND looks over his letter.
###GLOUCESTER
Kent’s been banished just like that? And the King of France gone in a huff? And King Lear’s abdicated his authority, making his kingship a ceremonial title only? All this so suddenly?—Edmund, what’s going on? What’s the news? 
###EDMUND
(pocketing the letter) No news, my lord. 
###GLOUCESTER
Why are you hiding that letter? 
###EDMUND
I don’t have any news to report, my lord. 
###GLOUCESTER
What’s that paper you were reading? 
###EDMUND
It’s nothing, my lord. 
###GLOUCESTER
No? Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry? If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it. Let’s see it. Come on, if it’s nothing, I won’t need glasses to read it. 
###EDMUND
Please, sir, I beg you. It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet. But judging from the bit I have read, it’s not fit for you to see. 
###GLOUCESTER
Give me that letter, sir. 
###EDMUND
Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not. The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell. 
###GLOUCESTER
(taking the letter) Let’s see, let’s see. 
###EDMUND
I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor. 
###GLOUCESTER
(reads) “The custom of respecting the elderly makes it hard for the young and healthy to live well, and keeps us without our inheritance until we are so old we can’t enjoy our happiness anyway. The power of the elderly is starting to feel like a silly and foolish slavery to me, and they only enjoy that power because we let them have it. 
Come talk to me about this. If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,      Edgar.” Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy? “If our father were dead, you’d receive half of his revenue forever”—my son Edgar? How did he bring himself to write such a thing? How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart? How did you get this letter? Who delivered it? 
###EDMUND
Nobody delivered it, my lord. That’s what’s clever about it. It was tossed into the window of my room. 
###GLOUCESTER
You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s? 
###EDMUND
If he’d written nice things, I’d swear yes right away. But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t. 
###GLOUCESTER
But it is his handwriting? 
###EDMUND
It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote. 
###GLOUCESTER
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before? 
###EDMUND
Never, my lord. But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining, the sons should be their fathers' guardians and manage their fathers' money. 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, what a villain! That’s just what he said in the letter. Evil villain! Monstrous, hateful, bestial villain! Worse 
than a beast! Go look for him. I’ll arrest him. Horrid villain! Where is he? 
###EDMUND
I’m not sure, my lord. But it may be a good idea to restrain your rage until you find out exactly what he meant. If you go after him and then find out that you made a mistake, it would damage your reputation and greatly undermine his loyalty to you. I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason. 
###GLOUCESTER
Do you think so? 
###EDMUND
If you agree, I’ll hide you somewhere where you can eavesdrop on us talking about it, and hear how he feels with your own ears. You won’t have to wait longer than until tonight. 
###GLOUCESTER
He can’t possibly be such a monster— 
###EDMUND
And I’m sure he isn’t. 
###GLOUCESTER
—toward his own father who loves him so completely. Oh, God! Edmund, go find him. Gain his confidence for me, please. Manage him however you think best. I’d give up my rank and fortune to be free from my doubts. 
###EDMUND
I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can. Then I’ll let you know what’s happening. 
###GLOUCESTER
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us. Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses. Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies. Riots 
break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps. This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father. The king acts unnaturally—father against child. We’ve seen the best our age has to offer. Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die. Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund. You won’t lose any respect. Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth! It’s strange, strange. 
## GLOUCESTER exits.
###EDMUND
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid. As if we become thieves and traitors according to astrological signs or obey planetary influences to become drunks, liars, and adulterers! As if some universal power pushed us into evil deeds! What a sneaky trick it is for lustful mankind to blame our horniness on some star! My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed. Christ! I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception. Edgar— 
## EDGAR enters.
and, speak of the devil, here he comes, right on cue. I’ve got to play the role and sigh like a poor beggar.—Oh, these eclipses predict such disorder. Fa, sol, la, mi. 
###EDGAR
Hello, brother Edmund. What are you thinking about so seriously? 
###EDMUND
I was thinking about what an astrologer predicted the other day. He wrote about what these eclipses mean. 
###EDGAR
Are you spending your valuable time on that? 
###EDMUND
Oh, I assure you the things he writes about are wretched —things like divisions between parents and children, death, famine, broken friendships, political rebellion, treason against the king and noblemen, exiled friends, dissolved armies, adultery, and I don’t know what else. 
###EDGAR
How long have you believed in astrology? 
###EDMUND
Come on. When was the last time you saw my father? 
###EDGAR
Why, last night. 
###EDMUND
Did you speak to him? 
###EDGAR
Yes, we talked for a couple of hours. 
###EDMUND
Did you leave on good terms? Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face? 
###EDGAR
No, none at all. 
###EDMUND
Try to remember how you might have offended him, and try to avoid spending time with him until his anger has cooled a little. Right now he’s so angry that even if he harmed you physically, he’d still be raging. 
###EDGAR
Some villain has told lies about me. 
###EDMUND
That’s what I’m afraid of. I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little. In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him. Please go. Here’s my key. If you go outside, arm yourself. 
###EDGAR
Arm myself? 
###EDMUND
Brother, I’m giving you good advice. Arm yourself. I’d be a liar if I told you nobody wanted to hurt you. I’ve told you what I’ve seen and heard, but I’ve toned it down a lot. I’ve spared you you the full extent of the horror that threatens you. Now please go. 
###EDGAR
Will I hear from you soon? 
###EDMUND
I’ll help you through this business. 
## EDGAR exits.
A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work. I know exactly how to proceed. If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever. Any trick that works is good for me. 
##He exits.
## GONERIL enters with her stewardsteward = person responsible for running the householdsteward, OSWALD.
###GONERIL
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool? 
###OSWALD
Yes, ma'am. 
###GONERIL
He constantly offends me. Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge. I won’t stand for it. His knights are getting out of control, and he himself reprimands us about every little detail. When he comes back from hunting, I’m not going to speak to him. Tell him I’m sick. And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be, that’ll be good. I’ll take responsibility for it. 
###OSWALD
He’s coming, ma'am. I hear him. 
##Hunting horns play offstage.
###GONERIL
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him—you and the other servants. I want it to become an issue. If he doesn’t like it, he can go live with my sister. I know she feels the same way about him that I do, and she’ll stand her ground. That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away. I swear, old fools become like babies again. You can’t just flatter them; you also have to discipline them when you see that they’re misguided. Remember what I’ve told you. 
###OSWALD
Very well, ma'am. 
###GONERIL
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights. Don’t worry about the consequences. Tell your men as much. I want this to provoke confrontations, so I can give him a piece of my mind. I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans. Now go, set up for dinner. 
##They exit in opposite directions.
## KENT enters in disguise.
###KENT
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly. I was banished, but hopefully I can serve the very king who condemned me. I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working. 
##Trumpets play offstage. LEAR enters with his attendant knights.
###LEAR
Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment. Get it ready immediately. 
##An attendant exits.
(to KENT) Well now, who are you? 
###KENT
A man, sir. 
###LEAR
What’s your profession? What do you want from me? 
###KENT
I profess that I’m as good as I seem—I’ll faithfully serve a master who trusts me, love those who are honest, talk with those who are wise and don’t talk too much. I’m God-fearing, I fight if I must, and I don’t eat fish. 
###LEAR
But who are you? 
###KENT
An honest guy who’s as poor as the king. 
###LEAR
If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor. What do you want? 
###KENT
To work as a servant. 
###LEAR
Who do you want to work for? 
###KENT
You. 
###LEAR
Do you know me? 
###KENT
No, sir, but there’s something about your face that makes me want to serve you. 
###LEAR
What do you see in my face? 
###KENT
Authority. 
###LEAR
What work can you do? 
###KENT
I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly. I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do. The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking. 
###LEAR
How old are you? 
###KENT
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason. I’m forty-eight. 
###LEAR
Follow me. You’ll work for me. If I still like you after dinner, I won’t send you away yet.—Hey, dinnertime! Dinner! Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here. 
##An attendant exits.
## OSWALD enters.
You, sir, where’s my daughter? 
###OSWALD
I beg your pardon, sir— 
## OSWALD exits.
###LEAR
What did that guy say? Call the numbskull back in here. 
##The FIRST KNIGHT exits.
Where’s my fool? You’d think everyone was asleep. 
##The FIRST KNIGHT enters again.
So what’s going on? Where’s that dog? 
###FIRST KNIGHT
He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord. 
###LEAR
Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him? 
###FIRST KNIGHT
Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it. 
###LEAR
Didn’t feel like it? 
###FIRST KNIGHT
My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before. The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly. 
###LEAR
Huh! Do you really mean that? 
###FIRST KNIGHT
Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted. 
###LEAR
No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed. I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind. I’ll look into it further. But where’s my fool? I haven’t seen him for two days. 
###FIRST KNIGHT
Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed. 
###LEAR
Let’s not talk about it. I’ve noticed it myself. Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her. 
##An attendant exits.
And you, go call my fool. 
##Another attendant exits.
## OSWALD enters.
You there, sir, come here please. Who am I, sir? 
###OSWALD
The father of the lady of the house, sir. 
### LEAR
“The father of the lady of the house”? You scoundrel! You lowlife son-of-a-bitch! You dog, you peasant! 
###OSWALD
I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not any of those things. 
###LEAR
Are you making faces at me, you scoundrel? (he hits OSWALD) 
###OSWALD
I won’t be hit, my lord. 
###KENT
(tripping OSWALD) Or tripped, you lowlife football player? 
###LEAR
(to KENT) Thank you, sir. You serve me well, and I’ll love you for it. 
###KENT
(to OSWALD) Come on, sir, get up and get out of here! I’ll teach you to respect your betters. If you want me to trip you again, then stick around. If not, get going. Go on. Do you know what’s good for you? There you go. 
## OSWALD exits.
###LEAR
Now, my friendly servant, thank you. 
##The FOOLThe fool is a professional court jester. Unlike other people, he doesn’t have to be polite and may say whatever he wants, as long as he’s funny.FOOL enters.
(giving KENT money) Here’s a token of my gratitude. 
###FOOL
Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude. (he offers KENT his cap) 
###LEAR
Well hello, my good boy. How are you doing? 
###FOOL
(to KENT) Guy, you’d better take my cap. 
###LEAR
Why, Fool? 
###FOOL
Why? For standing up for this unpopular king. No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it. There, take my fool’s cap. This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to. If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle? I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters. 
###LEAR
Why, my boy? 
###FOOL
If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself. Here’s mine. Ask your daughters for another one. 
###LEAR
Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you. 
###FOOL
I get whipped like a dog for telling the truth, while Lady Bitch gets to stand around the fire and stink the place up with her false words. 
###LEAR
A constant pain to me! 
###FOOL
I’ll recite something for you, guy. 
###LEAR
Yes, do that. 
###FOOL
Listen up, uncle. Have more than you show, Speak less than you know, Lend less than you owe. Ride more than you walk, Don’t believe everything you hear, Don’t bet everything on one throw of the dice, Leave behind your booze and your whore, And stay indoors, And you’ll end up with more Than two tens to a twenty. 
###KENT
That makes no sense, Fool. It’s nothing. 
###FOOL
In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer. You paid me nothing for it. Can’t you make any use of nothing, uncle? 
###LEAR
Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing. 
###FOOL
(to KENT) Please tell him that his income is nothing, now that he’s given his lands away. He won’t believe a fool. 
###LEAR
You’re a bitter fool. 
###FOOL
Do you know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one? 
###LEAR
No, son. Tell me. 
###FOOL
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land. You can stand in his place. The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away. The sweet fool in a fool’s costume—that’s me. The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEAR 
###LEAR
Are you calling me a fool, boy? 
###FOOL
Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles. The title of “fool” is the only one left. 
###Kent
This isn’t entirely a joke, your highness. 
###FOOL
No. I wish I could be a complete joker—but so many lords and important men are also playing fools that I can’t have a monopoly on it. Ladies too—they’re always snatching away my role as the biggest fool.—Uncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give you two crowns. 
###LEAR
Which two crowns would those be? 
###FOOL
Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns. When you cut your own crown and kingdom in half and gave away both parts, you were as foolish as the old man in the old story who carries his donkey on his back instead of letting the donkey carry him. You didn’t have much brains inside the bald crown of your head when you gave away the gold crown of your kingdom. If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish. (he sings) Fools have had a hard time this year. They’ve been displaced by wise men who’ve grown foolish. These men no longer know how to use their brains, And they don’t know how to behave except by foolishly imitating others. 
###LEAR
When did you become so fond of singing, boy? 
###FOOL
I’ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power. That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down, (he sings) Then your daughters wept for joy, And I sang in sadness, Seeing such a king become A child and a fool. Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie. I want to learn how to lie. 
###LEAR
If you lie, boy, we’ll have you whipped. 
###FOOL
I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are. They want to whip me for telling the truth, you want to whip me for lying, and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet. I’d rather be anything besides a fool. And yet I wouldn’t want to be you, uncle. When you gave away pieces of your kingdom, it’s as if you cut off pieces on both sides of your brain and left nothing in the middle. Here comes the owner of one piece. 
## GONERIL enters.
###LEAR
What’s going on, daughter? Why are you frowning like that? I think you’ve been frowning too much recently. 
###FOOL
(to LEAR) You were better off when you didn’t have to care whether she frowned or not. Now you’re a big zero, with no digit in front of it to give it value. I’m better than you are—I’m a fool and you’re nothing. (to GONERIL) Yes, I promise I’ll shut up. That’s what you’re telling me with that expression on your face, even though you don’t say anything. Mum, mum, The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back. (pointing at LEAR) That guy is an empty pea pod. 
###GONERIL
(to LEAR) It’s not just your fool here who can say whatever he wants, but your whole obnoxious entourage keeps whining and arguing, bursting out in intolerably vicious riots. Sir, I thought you could put an end to all this if I told you about it. But judging by what you’ve said and done recently, I’m worried that you don’t mind this chaos, and even approve of it. If that’s true, it’s shameful. I realize that restraining your knights 
will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre. However, this is an extreme situation, and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look. 
###FOOL
You know, uncle, A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off. So the candle went out and now we’re all in the dark. 
###LEAR
Are you my daughter? 
###GONERIL
Come on, sir. I know you’re very wise, and I wish you would use some of that wisdom to snap out of this mood you’ve been in lately and be your true self again. 
###FOOL
Even an idiot knows when the normal order has been inverted and the cart is pulling the horse. Whoo-hoo, honey, I love you! 
###LEAR
Does anyone here know who I am? I’m not Lear. Does Lear walk and talk like this? Where are his eyes? Either his mind is losing its grip or his judgment is screwy.—Hey, am I awake? I don’t think so. Who can tell me who I am? 
###FOOL
You’re Lear’s shadow. 
###LEAR
I’d like to find out who I am, since the obvious signs around me wrongly indicate that I’ve got daughters. 
###FOOL
Daughters who can make you obey them. 
###LEAR
(to GONERIL) What’s your name, my dear lady? 
###GONERIL
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks. I’m asking you to understand my point of view. Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise. But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel. They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace. It’s shameful, and we have to make some changes right away. Please, as a favor to me—and if you don’t do it for me, I’ll do it myself—reduce the number of your knights a little. Keep the ones who are older, like you, and who act their age. 
###LEAR
Hell and damnation! Saddle up my horses. Call my knights together. I won’t bother you any more, you monstrous bastard. You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left. 
###GONERIL
You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants. 
## ALBANY enters.
###LEAR
You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late. (to ALBANY) Oh, sir, are you here now? You decided to come? Answer me, sir. (to attendants) Get my horses ready. 
##An attendant exits.
Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster! 
###ALBANY
Please, sir, be patient. 
###LEAR
(to GONERIL) You disgusting vulture, you’re a liar! My knights are the finest men who can attend a king, and they meticulously uphold their reputation. Oh, how ugly did Cordelia’s small flaw appear! And now Cordelia’s small flaw has bent me completely out of shape and sucked all the love out of my heart. Oh, Lear, Lear, Lear! (he hits himself on the head) Let me beat this portal that let my good sense out and my foolishness in!— Go, go, people. 
###ALBANY
My lord, I have no idea what’s upset you, but whatever it is, I had nothing to do with it. 
###LEAR
That may be true, my lord. Ah, dear Nature, my goddess, listen to me! Change your plans if you ever intended for this woman to have children. Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her. If she must give birth, make her child a bad seed who will torment her, give her a forehead wrinkled with worry, make her cry until her cheeks are sunken. 
Let it be a wicked child who mocks the mother who cares for it. Make my daughter feel—make her feel how an ungrateful child hurts worse than a snakebite.—Now let’s leave. Go! 
## LEAR, the FOOL, KENT, FIRST KNIGHT, and attendant knights exit.
###ALBANY
Dear gods in heaven, what’s the reason for this? 
###GONERIL
Don’t even bother to ask the reasons. Just let him rant and rave. He’s senile. 
## LEAR enters with the FOOL.
###LEAR
What, fifty of my knights dismissed all at once? In only two weeks? 
###ALBANY
What are you talking about, sir? 
###LEAR
I’ll tell you. (to GONERIL) I’m ashamed that you have the power to upset me like this, as though you’re worth the tears you’re making me shed. Damn you! May you feel every pain a father’s curse can bring! If I cry again because of you, I’ll rip my eyes out of their sockets and throw them and their wet tears down to moisten the earth. Has it come to this? Then so be it. I have one more daughter who I’m sure is kind. When 
she hears what you’ve done to me, she’ll tear up your wolflike face with her fingernails. And then you’ll see that despite what you thought, I’ll be as powerful as I was before. You’ll see, I promise you. 
## LEAR exits.
###GONERIL
Did you hear that? 
###ALBANY
Goneril, you know how much I love you, but still I have to say— 
###GONERIL
Shush, please. Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here! (to FOOL) And you, sir, you’re more of a rascal than a fool. Go follow your master. 
###FOOL
Uncle Lear, uncle Lear, wait. Take your fool with you. A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered, If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them. So the fool follows you. 
##The FOOL exits.
###GONERIL
My father can’t think straight—a hundred knights! Just imagine the risk we run in letting him keep a hundred knights around! He could use them to strong-arm us into bowing to every little whim of his, and keep us at his mercy.—Oswald, where are you? 
###ALBANY
You may be exaggerating the risks. 
###GONERIL
That’s better than exaggerating our trust. It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid. I know how his mind works. I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said. If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved— 
## OSWALD enters.
###OSWALD
Here, ma'am. 
###GONERIL
Well, Oswald? Have you written that letter to my sister yet? 
###OSWALD
Yes, ma'am. 
###GONERIL
Take some men and horses and go to her. Tell her everything that worries me. Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying. Now go, and hurry back. 
## OSWALD exits.
No, no, my husband, I’m not angry that you urge me to deal more gently with my father. But you’re showing a lack of wisdom that that is much more noticeable than your tenderness toward him. 
###ALBANY
Maybe you know more than I do. But people often screw things up trying to make them better. 
###GONERIL
No, not at all— 
###ALBANY
All right, all right. Time will tell. 
##They exit.
## LEAR enters with KENT in disguise, and the FOOL.
###LEAR
(to KENT, giving him letters) Go ahead of us and deliver these letters to the Earl of Gloucester. Answer my daughter’s questions about the letter, but don’t tell her anything else you know. If you’re not quick enough, I’ll get there before you. 
###KENT
I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord. 
## KENT exits.
###FOOL
If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite? 
###LEAR
Yes, boy. 
###FOOL
In that case, cheer up. Your brains won’t need slippers to protect them from frostbite, since your brains aren’t in your feet—if they were you wouldn’t take this useless journey to see Regan. 
###LEAR
Ha, ha, ha! 
###FOOL
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly, you’ll see. Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know. 
###LEAR
And what do you know, boy? 
###FOOL
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples. Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face? 
###LEAR
No. 
###FOOL
Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out. 
###LEAR
I was wrong to her— 
###FOOL
Do you know how an oyster makes its shell? 
###LEAR
No. 
###FOOL
Me neither. But I know why a snail carries its house on its back. 
###LEAR
Why? 
###FOOL
So that he always has a roof over his head. He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter. 
###LEAR
I want to forget what I am. Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready? 
###FOOL
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready. There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it. 
###LEAR
Because it doesn’t have eight? 
###FOOL
That’s right. You’d make a good fool. 
###LEAR
I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude! 
###FOOL
If you were my fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time. 
###LEAR
How’s that? 
###FOOL
You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise. 
###LEAR
Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad! Keep me balanced and sane. I don’t want to go mad. 
##A GENTLEMAN enters.
So, are the horses ready? 
###GENTLEMAN
They’re ready, my lord. 
###LEAR
Come on, boy. 
## LEAR and the GENTLEMAN exit.
###FOOL
(speaking to the audience) Any girl who laughs because I’m going with the king is too foolish to remain a virgin very long. 
##He exits.
## EDMUND and CURAN enter from different directions.
###EDMUND
Hello, Curan. 
###CURAN
Hello, sir. I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight. 
###EDMUND
Why is that? 
###CURAN
I don’t know. Have you heard the latest news?—I mean the whispered rumors, since that’s all they are at this point. 
###EDMUND
No, I haven’t. What’s going on? 
###CURAN
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany? 
###EDMUND
Not a word. 
###CURAN
You may hear about it soon. Goodbye, sir. 
## CURAN exits.
###EDMUND
The duke will be here tonight? All the better—in fact it’s the best that could happen. His arrival fits perfectly into my plan. My father’s ready to arrest my brother, and I have one risky thing to do. Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you? Come down, brother. 
## EDGAR enters.
Father is on the lookout. Get out of here quickly! It has leaked out that you’re hiding here. If you leave now, you can take advantage of the darkness and sneak away. You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you? He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him. Have you said anything against Cornwall or Albany? Think about it. 
###EDGAR
I’m sure of it. I haven’t said a word. 
###EDMUND
I hear my father coming. Forgive me. I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword. Draw your sword too, as if you’re defending yourself. Be convincing. (loudly) Give up! Go see my father.—Bring in some light!(speaking so that only EDGAR can hear) Run, brother. (loudly) Torches, bring in the torches! (speaking so that only EDGAR can hear) Goodbye, then. 
## EDGAR exits.
If I had some blood on me it would look like I’d fought more fiercely. (he cuts his own arm) I’ve seen drunk men do worse than this just fooling around.—Father, father!—Stop, stop!—Won’t anyone help me? 
## GLOUCESTER enters along with servants carrying torches.
###GLOUCESTER
Edmund, where’s your wicked brother? 
###EDMUND
He was standing here in the dark with his sword pointing at me. He was mumbling some black magic spells, appealing to the moon to help him in his evil plans— 
###GLOUCESTER
But where is he? 
###EDMUND
Look, sir, I’m bleeding. 
###GLOUCESTER
Where is the villain, Edmund? 
###EDMUND
He ran out that way, sir, when he couldn’t— 
###GLOUCESTER
Follow him, now! Go. 
##Some servants exit.
When he couldn’t what? 
###EDMUND
When he couldn’t persuade me to kill you. I told him that the gods hate men who kill their fathers and unleash all their thunder on them, and that the bond between father and child was sacred. In short, when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan, he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body, cutting my arm. Bolstered by righteousness, I prepared to fight, and when he saw my excitement—or perhaps because my shouting scared him—he ran away suddenly. 
###GLOUCESTER
Let him run far away. If he stays in this country he’ll be found. And if he’s caught, he’ll be executed. The Duke of Cornwall, my master and patron, is arriving tonight. On his authority I’ll proclaim that whoever finds Edgar and helps bring the murderous coward to 
justice will be rewarded. Whoever helps Edgar hide will die. 
###EDMUND
After I urged him not to kill you, I saw that he was still determined to do it. Enraged, I threatened to expose him. He answered, “You penniless bastard! Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours, anyone would believe you? No. I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery. And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.” 
##Trumpets play offstage.
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, how monstrously evil! He said he would deny that he wrote his letter? He cannot truly be my son.—Listen. The duke’s trumpets. I don’t know why he’s come here. I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors. The villain won’t escape. The duke will agree with me on that. And I’ll send his picture everywhere so that the whole kingdom will know what he looks like.—And as for you, my loyal and true son, I’ll find some way to make you my heir. 
##The Duke of CORNWALL enters with REGAN and attendants.
###CORNWALL
How are you, my friend? Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors. 
###REGAN
If they’re true, no punishment is harsh enough for the criminal. How are you, my lord? 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, madam, my old heart is broken, broken. 
###REGAN
Did my father’s godson try to kill you? The one whom my father named, your son Edgar? 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, my lady, I’m ashamed to admit it. 
###REGAN
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father? 
###GLOUCESTER
I don’t know, madam. Oh, it’s too terrible. 
###EDMUND
To answer your question, ma'am—yes, he was friendly with those knights. 
###REGAN
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him. They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money. Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house. 
###CORNWALL
And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father. 
###EDMUND
I just did my duty, sir. 
###GLOUCESTER
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him. 
###CORNWALL
Are your men searching for him? 
###GLOUCESTER
Yes, my lord. 
###CORNWALL
If he’s caught, he’ll never make trouble for anyone again. Feel free to use my authority however you wish in order to apprehend him.—As for you, Edmund, you’ve been so loyal and virtuous throughout this whole business. I’d like you to work for me. I need people as trustworthy as you. 
###EDMUND
I’ll always be loyal to you, sir. 
###GLOUCESTER
(to cornwall) Thank you, my lord, for your kindness to Edmund. 
###CORNWALL
You don’t know why we came to visit you— 
###REGAN
Yes, and so unexpectedly, at night. There are some important matters we need your advice on, Gloucester. My father and my sister have both recently written to me about arguments between them. I realized it would be inconvenient to answer them from home, especially since the king may be on his way there. Their messengers are ready, waiting to deliver our response in these matters. So please, old friend, give us some good advice. We need it desperately and immediately. 
###GLOUCESTER
I’m at your service, madam. Both of you are very welcome here. 
##Trumpets play. They all exit.
## KENT enters in disguise. OSWALD enters from elsewhere.
###OSWALD
Good morning to you, friend. Do you work in this house? 
###KENT
Yes, I do. 
###OSWALD
Where should we stable our horses? 
###KENT
In the mud. 
###OSWALD
Please, sir, be kind to me and tell me. 
###KENT
I won’t be kind to you. 
###OSWALD
In that case, I don’t much care for you either. 
###KENT
If I could get my hands on you, I’d make you care. 
###OSWALD
Why are you talking to me like this? I don’t even know you. 
###KENT
Ah, but I know you. 
###OSWALD
Who am I then? 
###KENT
You’re a lowlife, a rascal who eats leftover scraps. You’re an ignoble, arrogant, shallow, vulgar, pretentious, conceited, filthy third-rate servant who thinks he’s something special. You’re a cowardly lawyer-loving bastard; a vain, brown-nosing, prissy scoundrel who’d pimp himself out to advance his career; a bag lady. You’re nothing but a lowlife, a beggar, a coward, and a pimp, the son and heir of a mutt bitch. I’ll beat you until you whine and cry if you deny the least bit of this. 
###OSWALD
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you! 
###KENT
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me! It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king. Draw your sword, scoundrel. It may be nighttime, but there’s enough moonlight to fight by. I’ll make ground beef out of you. (he draws his sword) Draw, you affected, preening son of a bitch! Draw your sword! 
###OSWALD
Get away from me! I’ve got nothing to do with you. 
###KENT
Draw your sword, you jerk! You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness. Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak. Draw your sword! Come on! 
###OSWALD
Help! Murderer! Help! 
###KENT
Fight, peasant. Don’t run away, scoundrel. Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight! (he hits OSWALD) 
###OSWALD
Help! Murder, murder! 
## EDMUND enters with his sword drawn, followed by the Duke of CORNWALL, the Duchess REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and servants.
###EDMUND
What’s going on here? Get away from each other. 
###KENT
(to EDMUND) Well, kid, let’s see you fight. Come on, I’ll show you how. 
###GLOUCESTER
You have weapons? What’s going on here? 
###CORNWALL
Stop it, I order you. The next person to strike again dies. What’s going on here? 
###REGAN
These are the messengers from my sister and the king. 
###CORNWALL
What are you fighting about? Tell me. 
###OSWALD
I’m out of breath, sir. 
###KENT
No wonder, with all your exertions, you cowardly rascal. You’re not worth being called a man. The only thing manly about you are your clothes. A tailor made you. 
###CORNWALL
That’s an odd thing to say. How can a tailor make a person? 
###KENT
Definitely a tailor, sir. A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice. 
###CORNWALL
But tell me what you’re fighting about. 
###OSWALD
This old ruffian here, whom I didn’t kill because he’s so old— 
###KENT
You useless bastard—you’re like the letter “z,” a totally unnecessary addition to the alphabet.—My lord, please let me grind this lumpy lowlife into a powder and use it to plaster up the bathroom walls.—You didn’t kill me because I’m so old, you fawning dog? 
###CORNWALL
Calm down. Don’t you have any manners, you savage? 
###KENT
Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged. 
###CORNWALL
Why are you enraged? 
###KENT
I’m angry that a dishonorable lowlife like this wears a sword like a gentleman. Smiling swindlers such as he undo the sacred bonds that unite people together, and only encourage the unreasonable passions of their masters. They foster both rage and apathy. They say “Yes” and “No,” turning their noses whichever way the wind blows without taking a firm stance on anything. They blindly follow their masters' impulses, like dogs.—Damn your ugly stinking face! Are you laughing at what I say, as if I were a fool? If I had my way with you right now, I’d send you to back to where you came from. 
###CORNWALL
Are you insane, old man? 
###GLOUCESTER
(to KENT) What did you start quarreling over? Just tell us. 
###KENT
I couldn’t hate that jerk over there any more than I do. 
###CORNWALL
Why are you calling him a jerk? What did he do to you? 
###KENT
I don’t like his face. 
###CORNWALL
But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either. 
###KENT
I’m used to telling the truth, sir, and I have to say that I’ve seen better faces than those I see here. 
###CORNWALL
This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness, and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words. No flattery for him, no sir! He’s honest, he’s got to speak the truth. If people take what he says, fine. If not, he’s got truth on his side! I know his type. He’s sneaky behind all his so-called bluntness, sneakier than twenty brown-nosing bootlickers who only tell you what you want to hear. 
###KENT
Dearest, kindest, most honorable sir, may I say, with your esteemed approval, which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus, that— 
###CORNWALL
What do you mean by that? 
###KENT
I tried to stop speaking plainly, since you dislike plain speech so much. Sir, I know I’m not a flatterer. The guy who tricked you with plain language was just a plain crook—which I’m not, however much I may displease you by not being one. 
###CORNWALL
(to OSWALD) How did you offend him? 
###OSWALD
I never offended him at all. Recently, the king hit me because of a misunderstanding. This man took sides with the king and tripped me. When I was down on the ground he insulted me, and then started acting tough to seem courageous in front of the king. The king praised him, even though I had never offered any resistance at all. Now he pulled out his sword on me again, still riled up from our first encounter. 
###KENT
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men. 
###CORNWALL
Bring out the stocks !—We’ll teach you, you stubborn old bastard, you arrogant show-off. 
###KENT
Sir, I’m too old to be taught anything. Don’t put me in the stocks. I serve the king, who sent me here. If you put me in the stocks you’ll insult him both as a king and as a man. 
###CORNWALL
Bring out the stocks! I swear on my life and honor, he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon. 
###REGAN
Only until noon, my lord? No, the whole day, and all night too. 
###KENT
Ma'am, you wouldn’t treat me like this if I were your father’s dog. 
###REGAN
But since you’re his scoundrel servant, I will. 
##The stocks are brought out.
###CORNWALL
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about.—Come on, bring in the stocks, now! 
###GLOUCESTER
I beg you not to do this, my lord. He’s done wrong, and his master the king will punish him for it. But the kind 
of punishment you propose is more suited to petty shoplifters than to royal attendants. The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated. 
###CORNWALL
I’ll take responsibility for that. 
###REGAN
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks. 
## KENT is put in the stocks.
###CORNWALL
(to GLOUCESTER) Let’s go, my lord. 
##Everyone exits except GLOUCESTER and KENT.
###GLOUCESTER
I’m sorry, my friend. The duke always gets it his way, and everyone knows you can’t budge him once he’s made up his mind. I’ll try talking to him again. 
###KENT
Please don’t, sir. I’ve been up for a long time and have done a lot of traveling recently. This punishment will be a good chance to catch up on my sleep. The rest of the time I’ll whistle to entertain myself. Even good men have bad luck. Have a good morning. 
###GLOUCESTER
It’s wrong for the duke to do this. The king will be angry with him. 
## GLOUCESTER exits.
###KENT
Oh, good King Lear, you’re proving that, just as they say, everything goes from good to bad. (he takes out a letter) Rise and shine, sun, so I can read this letter. Only those who are truly miserable see miracles. I know this letter is from Cordelia, who knows that I’m serving the king in disguise. (looking at the letter) She says that she will have time, now that she’s away from the monstrous conditions here, to find a way to fix things. I’m exhausted. I’ve been awake too long. This fatigue gives me an excuse to shut my eyes so I can’t see myself humiliated in the stocks. Good night, Lady Luck. Smile and spin your wheel of fortune again. (he sleeps) 
## EDGAR enters.
###EDGAR
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree. Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout, waiting to capture me. But I’ll survive while I can. I’ve decided to disguise myself as the lowliest and rattiest beggar that mankind has ever seen. I’ll smear my face with filth, put on a loincloth, make my hair matted and tangled, and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing. I’ve seen beggars out of insane asylums who stick pins and nails into their numb arms. They pray or roar lunatic curses, horrifying farmers and villagers into giving them alms. “Poor crazy Tom!” they call themselves. Well, at least that’s something. As Edgar, I’m nothing at all. 
##He exits.
## KENT is in the stocks. LEAR enters with the FOOL and the GENTLEMAN.
###LEAR
It’s strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger. 
###GENTLEMAN
According to what I heard, they had no travel plans as of last night. 
###KENT
(to LEAR) Hail, noble master! 
###LEAR
What’s this? Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself? 
###KENT
No, my lord. 
###FOOL
Ha, ha! That’s a nasty garter belt. You tie up horses by their heads, dogs and bears by their necks, monkeys by their waists, and humans by their legs. When a person’s prone to wanderlust, he has to wear wooden socks, like a chastity belt around his ankles. 
###LEAR
(to KENT) Who could have misunderstood your assigment so completely as to lock you up like this? 
###KENT
Your daughter and son-in-law. 
###LEAR
No. 
###KENT
Yes. 
###LEAR
I’m telling you “No.” 
###KENT
And I’m telling you “Yes.” 
###LEAR
No, no, they wouldn’t. 
###KENT
Yes, they have. 
###LEAR
By the god Jupiter above, I swear “No.” 
###KENT
By Jupiter’s wife Juno, I swear “Yes.” 
###LEAR
They wouldn’t dare. They couldn’t, they wouldn’t. It’s worse than murder to humiliate a king’s messenger like this. Tell me as quickly and clearly as you can what you did to deserve this punishment, or what made them think they could inflict it on you. 
###KENT
My lord, when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter. Before I had a chance to get up from my respectful kneeling position, Goneril’s messenger arrived, stinky, sweaty, and out of breath. He interrupted me, spouted out greetings from her, and delivered her letter, which they opened immediately. After reading it, they gathered their entourage together and got on their horses to go. They glared at me and ordered me to follow them and wait for their answer. After we arrived here, I ran into that other messenger who made them give me the cold shoulder—the very same guy who was so rude to you, King. I admit it was foolish to draw my sword on him, but I had to act like a man. He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams. That’s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully. 
###FOOL
This story bodes more stormy weather. Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them. But fathers who are rich Make their children kind. Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break. But despite all this, your daughters will give you a lot of money—or do I mean pain?—in the coming year. 
###LEAR
I’m getting hysterical. I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart. Calm down, you belong lower down!—Where is this daughter of mine? 
###KENT
Inside, sir, with the earl. 
###LEAR
Don’t follow me. Stay here. 
##He exits.
###GENTLEMAN
You didn’t do anything else to earn this punishment? 
###KENT
Nothing. Tell me, why did the king arrive with such a small entourage? 
###FOOL
If they’d put you in the stocks for asking that question, you would’ve deserved it. 
###KENT
Why, Fool? 
###FOOL
You need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit. Serving the king will get you nowhere. Everyone can see that, and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now. When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill, you shouldn’t try to hold on to it or it’ll break your neck. 
But if you see a wheel going uphill, latch on for the ride. And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did, give me my advice back again. I only want idiots following my advice, the advice of a fool. The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm. But I’ll linger. The fool will stay. And let the wise man run away. The servant who runs away is a fool. But this fool is no scoundrel, by God. 
###KENT
Where did you learn that song, Fool? 
###FOOL
Not in the stocks, fool. 
## LEAR and GLOUCESTER enter.
###LEAR
How can they refuse to speak with me? How can they say that they’re sick or exhausted or that they have traveled all night!? They’re playing with me. These are tricks. This is rebellion. Go ask them again and make them see me this time. 
###GLOUCESTER
My dear lord, you know how passionately stubborn the duke is. He never changes his mind. 
###LEAR
Hell! Damn it all to hell! “Passionately”? What “passion”? Gloucester, Gloucester, I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife. 
###GLOUCESTER
My lord, I informed them as much. 
###LEAR
“Informed them”? Do you understand what I’m saying, man? 
###GLOUCESTER
Yes, my lord. 
###LEAR
The king wants to speak with Cornwall. The father wants to speak with his daughter. He orders them—he begs them. Did you inform them of that? This is unbelievable! “Passionate”? The “passionate” duke? Tell the hot-headed duke that I… But no, not yet. Maybe he’s not feeling well. When we’re ill we can’t carry out our duties as well as when we’re healthy. When our bodies are out of order, our minds can’t function properly. I’ll hold off, and subdue my impulsive temper, which makes me judge a sick man as if he were well. (he notices KENT again) A curse on my royal power! Why should he sit here like this? The fact that they punished him convinces me that Regan and the duke are avoiding me on purpose. I want my servant released. Go tell the duke and his wife I’ll speak to them right now, at once. Tell them to come here and hear me out, or else I’ll beat a drum at their bedroom door until they can’t sleep any more. 
###GLOUCESTER
I just want everything to be all right between you. 
## GLOUCESTER exits.
###LEAR
Oh, my heart, my heart is rising into my throat! Stay down, heart. 
###FOOL
That’s right, uncle, talk to your heart, like the housewife who yelled at the eels she was putting in her pie. She hit 'em on the head with a stick and shouted, “Down, you naughty things, down!” That was the woman whose brother wanted to be nice to his horse, and buttered its hay. 
##The Duke of CORNWALL, REGAN, and GLOUCESTER enter with their servants.
###LEAR
Good morning to you both. 
###CORNWALL
Hail to your majesty. 
## KENT is set free.
###REGAN
I’m glad to see your highness. 
###LEAR
I believe you are, Regan. You know why I think so? Because if you weren’t glad, I’d divorce your dead mother, because I’d know she cheated on me. Any true daughter of mine would definitely be glad to see me. (to KENT) Oh, are you free? We’ll talk about it later. 
## KENT exits.
My dear Regan, your sister’s not worth anything. Oh, Regan, she’s torn me apart with unkindness, like a vulture, right here. (points to his heart) I can hardly speak. You’ll never believe how monstrously—oh, Regan! 
###REGAN
Calm down, sir, please. I hope there’s been a misunderstanding. It’s more likely that you don’t know how to appreciate her than that she’d ever fail in her duties as a daughter. 
###LEAR
How do you mean? 
###REGAN
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way. If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it. 
###LEAR
I curse her. 
###REGAN
Sir, you’re old. Your life is stretched to its limit. You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you. Please go back to Goneril’s house. Admit you were wrong. 
###LEAR
Apologize? Do you think this kind of thing is appropriate for the royal family? (he kneels) “Dear daughter, I admit I’m old. Old people are useless. I’m begging you, on my knees, to give me food, clothes, and a bed.” 
###REGAN
No more, please. These are ugly antics. Go back to my sister’s. 
###LEAR
(getting up) Never, Regan. She’s sent away half my knights, glared at me, and aimed her venomous insults straight at my heart. She and her ingratitude can go to hell! I hope she gets sick and becomes lame! 
###CORNWALL
Shush, sir, please! 
###LEAR
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes! I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion! 
###REGAN
Oh, dear gods! That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood. 
###LEAR
No, Regan. I’ll never curse you. You’re so gentle, you’d never be harsh like her. Her eyes are vicious, but yours are comforting. You’d never deny me my pleasures, downsize my entourage, insult me thoughtlessly, reduce my allowance, or lock me out of the house. You know better than she does how important the duties of a child to a parent are, and the responsibilities that come from gratitude. You haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you. 
###REGAN
Sir, let’s get to the point. 
###LEAR
Who put my messenger in the stocks? 
##Trumpets play offstage.
###CORNWALL
What’s that trumpet? 
## OSWALD enters.
###REGAN
I know it. It’s my sister’s. She’ll be here soon, just like her letter said. (to OSWALD) Has my sister arrived? 
###LEAR
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for.—Get out of my sight, scoundrel! 
###CORNWALL
What do you mean, your highness? 
## GONERIL enters.
###LEAR
Who put my servant in the stocks? Regan, I hope you didn’t know anything about that.—Ah, who’s this? Dear gods, if you love old men like me, if you believe in obedience, if you yourselves are old, then please send me down some help! (to GONERIL) Aren’t you ashamed to look at me after the way you’ve treated me in my old age?—Oh, Regan, are you taking her by the hand? 
###GONERIL
Why shouldn’t she take my hand, father? How exactly have I offended you? Just because a senile man with poor judgment calls something an insult doesn’t necessarily mean it is one. 
###LEAR
Oh, how can the sides of my body hold in my grieving heart?—How did my messenger wind up in the stocks? 
###CORNWALL
I sent him there, sir, but his crimes deserved a worse punishment. 
###LEAR
You! You did it? 
###REGAN
Please, father, since you’re weak, act like it. Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister. Afterward, you can stay with me. Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care. 
###LEAR
Go back with her? Send away fifty of my knights? No. I’d rather renounce living in a house, and wander in the open air in the hardships of poverty, as a friend of the wolf and the owl. Go back with her? I might as well go before the King of France, who took my youngest daughter without a dowry, kneel before his throne, and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive. Go back with her? I’d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here. (he points to OSWALD) 
###GONERIL
As you wish, sir. 
###LEAR
I beg you, daughter, don’t make me crazy. I won’t bother you. We’ll never see each other again. But you’re still my child, my flesh and blood—or rather you’re a disease in my flesh, a disease I still have to call my own. You’re a pustule, a sore, a tumor digesting my bloodline. But I’ll stop rebuking you. You’ll feel shame when the time is right, and I don’t urge you to be ashamed now. I won’t beg the gods to punish you, or caution you to fear their judgment. Become a better 
person when you’re ready, if you’re inclined. I’ll wait patiently. Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights. 
###REGAN
It’s not quite that simple. I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you. Please hear what Goneril is saying. We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset, and we understand that you’re old, and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing. 
###LEAR
Do you mean what you’ve just said? 
###REGAN
Yes, I do. Isn’t fifty knights enough for you? Why would you need more than that? Or even that many. Fifty knights are expensive to maintain, and there’s always a risk they’ll rebel. How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof? It would be hard, almost impossible. 
###GONERIL
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s? 
###REGAN
Yes, why not, my lord? Then if they’re negligent, we could control them. Now that I think about the danger of these knights, if you come to stay with me, please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you. I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof. 
###LEAR
I gave you everything— 
###REGAN
And it was about time too. 
###LEAR
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own. Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five? Regan, is that what you said? 
###REGAN
Yes, I’ll say it again, my lord. No more than twenty-five. 
###LEAR
Bad people start to look better in comparison with worse people. Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise, I guess. (to GONERIL) I’ll go stay with you, then. Your fifty is twice her twenty-five, so you must love me twice as much as she does. 
###GONERIL
Hear me out, my lord. Why do you need twenty-five knights, or ten, or even five, when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service? 
###REGAN
Why do you need even one? 
###LEAR
Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them! Even the poorest beggars have some meager possessions they don’t really “need.” If you allow people no more than what they absolutely need to survive, then a human life is no better than an animal’s. You’re a well-dressed lady. If you dressed only to stay warm, you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing—which don’t keep you warm at all. If you want to talk about true needs, what I really need is patience. Oh, gods, give me patience! You see me here, gods, a grieving old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age. If you’re the ones setting my daughters against me, don’t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down. Give me noble anger, and don’t let any womanly tears fall down my 
man’s cheeks. No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating. You expect me to cry? Well, I won’t. 
##A storm breaks out.
I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad! 
##King LEAR, the GENTLEMAN, and the FOOL exit with GLOUCESTER.
###CORNWALL
Let’s go inside. There’s going to be a storm. 
###REGAN
This is a small house. There’s no room for the old man and his followers. 
###GONERIL
It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this. He has to pay the price for his foolish actions. 
###REGAN
I’ll be happy to keep him in my house, but not a single knight. 
###GONERIL
That’s what I intend to do too. Where is Gloucester? 
###CORNWALL
He followed the old man. Here he comes back. 
## GLOUCESTER returns.
###GLOUCESTER
The king is enraged. 
###CORNWALL
Where’s he going? 
###GLOUCESTER
He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed. 
###CORNWALL
It’s best just to let him go. He won’t listen to anyone’s advice. 
###GONERIL
(to GLOUCESTER) My lord, don’t try to persuade him to stay. 
###GLOUCESTER
Ah, but it’s getting dark, and the winds are strong and stormy. There’s hardly a bush for miles around. He’ll have no shelter. 
###REGAN
Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions. Lock the doors. His attendants are desperate, violent men. I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in. 
###CORNWALL
Lock the doors, my lord. It’s a wild night. Regan gives good advice. Come in out of the storm. 
##They all exit.
##The storm continues to rage. KENT enters in disguise. The GENTLEMAN enters from a different direction.
###KENT
Who’s there, aside from this foul weather? 
###GENTLEMAN
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled. 
###KENT
I know you. Where’s the king? 
###GENTLEMAN
Struggling with the wind and rain. He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos. He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness. Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth. He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide. 
###KENT
But who’s with him? 
###GENTLEMAN
Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes. 
###KENT
Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you. There’s a feud between Albany and Cornwall, although they’ve been clever enough to hide it thus far. Like other powerful rulers, they have servants who are actually French spies in disguise. These spies have noticed something, perhaps in the squabbles between Albany and Cornwall, or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king, or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems—The point is that the King of France has sent troops into our divided kingdom. Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war. Now this is where you come in. If you trust me enough to hurry to Dover, you’ll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king’s suffering. I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you. 
###GENTLEMAN
Let’s discuss it some more. 
###KENT
(giving the GENTLEMAN a purse and a ring) No, there’s no need. To assure you that I am a nobleman in disguise, here is some money. If you see Cordelia—as I’m sure you will—show her this ring. She’ll tell you who I am. Damn this storm! I’ll go find the king. 
###GENTLEMAN
Let me shake your hand. Do you have anything else to tell me? 
###KENT
Only a few more words, but they’re the most important. Let me go this way, and you go that way. When one of us finds the king, he’ll call out to the other one. 
##They exit in opposite directions.
##The storm continues. LEAR and the FOOL enter.
###LEAR
Blow, winds! Blow until your cheeks crack! Rage on, blow! Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned. Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head. Let thunder flatten the spherical world, crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings, and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow! 
###FOOL
Oh, uncle, it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here. Please, uncle, let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you. This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools. 
###LEAR
Let thunder rumble! Let lightning spit fire! Let the rain spray! The rain, the wind, the thunder and lightning are not my daughters. Nature, I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness. I never gave you a kingdom or raised you as my child, and you don’t owe me any obedience. So go ahead and have your terrifying fun. Here I am, your slave—a poor, sick, weak, hated old man. But I can still accuse you of kowtowing, taking my daughters' side against me, ancient as I am. Oh, it’s foul! 
###FOOL
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders. The guy who finds a place to put his penis Before he has a house of his own Will wind up dirt poor and covered with lice 
With a crowd of slut daughters to add to the slut wife. The man who kicks away The person he should love Will bring himself pain And sleepless nights. For there never was a pretty woman who didn’t like to preen in the mirror. 
## KENT enters in disguise.
###LEAR
No, I’ll be patient. I won’t say a word. 
###KENT
Who’s there? 
###FOOL
A wise man and a fool. 
###KENT
(to LEAR) Ah, sir, you’re here? Even creatures of the night aren’t out tonight in this storm. The angry skies terrify the animals that usually prowl in the dark, making them stay in their caves. Never in my life have I heard such horrible blasts of thunder, such a roaring downpour, such groaning winds. It’s too trying and terrifying for humans to bear. 
###LEAR
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light. Any wretched person who has committed secret crimes and escaped justice should tremble in fear now. Better hide now, you murderers, you perjurers, you incest-practicing people who pretend to be virtuous. Tremble and shake, villain, for secretly plotting against human lives. Let all your bottled-up crimes come flooding out at last, as you beg for 
mercy from the gods who summon these terrifying winds and thunderbolts. Other people have sinned against me more than I have sinned against them. 
###KENT
Why, you’re not even wearing a hat? My lord, there’s a hut nearby. It will give you some protection from this storm. Rest there while I go back to the unfriendly house where your sisters are staying, and ask them for help. They are harder than the stones the house is made of. Just now, when I asked them if they knew where you were, they wouldn’t let me in. But I’ll go back and force them to be polite. 
###LEAR
I’m starting to lose my mind. (to the FOOL) Come on, my boy. How are you? Are you cold? I’m cold myself. (to KENT) Where’s this hut, man? Odd how when you’re desperate, even shoddy things like this hut can seem precious. Show me where that hut is. Poor fool, part of me still feels sorry for you. 
###FOOL
(singing) The stupid man— Hey-hoy, the wind and the rain— Must take what he can get, Since the rain comes every day. 
###LEAR
That’s true, my good boy.—Come on, take us to that hut. 
## LEAR and KENT exit.
###FOOL
This would be a great night to satisfy a whore’s lust. I’ll recite a prophecy before I go. One day, when priests don’t practice what they preach, When brewers dilute their beer with water, When noblemen teach their tailors how to sew, When instead of heretics being burned at the stake, lovers are burned by syphilis, When every law case is tried fairly, When no gentleman is in debt, When no one slanders anyone else, And thieves don’t snatch wallets in crowds, When moneylenders count their gold in the open air, And pimps and whores build fine churches— Then the kingdom of England Will come to ruin. And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet. This is the prophecy that the wizard Merlin will make one day. I’m a little ahead of my time in saying it now. 
##He exits.
## GLOUCESTER and EDMUND enter with torches.
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, oh, Edmund, I don’t like this monstrous business. When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm, they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him, lobby for him, or support him in any way. 
###EDMUND
That’s uncivilized and unnatural! 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, be quiet. There’s a feud between the two dukes. And there’s something even worse than that. I got a letter tonight. It’s dangerous to talk about it. I’ve locked it up in my room. The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly. Armed forces have already landed. We have to take the king’s side. I’ll look for him and secretly help him. You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king. If he asks to see me, tell him I’m sick and went to bed. Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king. Strange things are about to happen, Edmund. Please be careful. 
## GLOUCESTER exits.
###EDMUND
I’ll tell the duke right away that you’re going to see the king, which is forbidden. And I’ll tell him about the letter too. You’ll get what you deserve, and I’ll be rewarded with everything you lose—in other words, all your lands. The young generation rises while the old one falls. 
##He exits.
## LEAR enters with KENT in disguise and the FOOL.
###KENT
Here’s the hut, my lord. Please go inside. The night’s too rough for humans to bear. 
##The storm continues.
###LEAR
Leave me for a bit. 
###KENT
My lord, here is the entrance. 
###LEAR
Will you break my heart? 
###KENT
I’d rather break my own heart. Now please go in. 
###LEAR
You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin. It’s a big deal to you. But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears. You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear. When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements. But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are! Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it? But I’ll punish them thoroughly. No, I won’t cry any more. Imagine them locking me out on a night like this! But let it rain; I’ll survive. On a night like this! Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad. I want to avoid that. No more of these thoughts. 
###KENT
My lord, please go inside here. 
###LEAR
Go inside yourself. Make yourself comfortable. This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more. But I’ll go in. (to FOOL) You go in first, boy. Oh, you suffering homeless people—No, you go in. I’ll pray first, then I’ll sleep. 
##The FOOL exits.
Poor homeless creatures suffering this storm, wherever you are, how will you survive a night like this with no roof over your heads, no fat on your sides to keep you warm, and only rags for clothes? When I was king I didn’t do enough to help you. Powerful men, take your medicine by learning about hardship. Go out and feel what the impoverished feel. Then you can give them your extra wealth and make the world more fair. 
###EDGAR
(from inside) The water in here is nine feet deep! Poor Tom! 
##FOOL enters.
###FOOL
Don’t come in here, uncle! There’s a spirit in here! Help me, help me! 
###KENT
Give me your hand. Who’s there? 
###FOOL
A ghost, a ghost! He says his name’s Poor Tom. 
###KENT
Who are you, moaning in the hut like that? Come out. 
## EDGAR enters disguised.
###EDGAR
Go away! The devil’s after me! The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees. Ha! Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up. 
###LEAR
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this? 
###EDGAR
Whoever gave a thing to Poor Tom? The devil has chased him through fires, across rivers and whirlpools, and over swamps. The devil has put knives under Tom’s pillow and hangman’s ropes in his church pew, encouraging him to kill himself. The devil has put rat poison next to Poor Tom’s oatmeal and made him gallop his horse over narrow bridges, chasing his own shadow as if it were a traitor. Bless your five senses! Tom’s chilly. Oh do-de, do-de, do-de. God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases! Take pity on Poor Tom, who is persecuted by the devil. I can almost catch him. There!… And over there!… And over there! 
##The storm continues.
###LEAR
Have his daughters made him crazy like this?—Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself? Did you have to give them everything? 
###FOOL
No, he kept a blanket to cover himself with. If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him. 
###LEAR
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners! 
###KENT
He doesn’t have any daughters, sir. 
###LEAR
Like hell! Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this. Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity? That’s a fair punishment! I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters. 
###EDGAR
Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill. La, la, la, la! 
###FOOL
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen. 
###EDGAR
Beware of the devil. Obey your parents, keep your word, don’t swear, don’t sleep with another man’s wife, and don’t covet flashy clothes. Tom’s chilly. 
###LEAR
What were you before this? 
###EDGAR
I used to be an honorable devoted servant who curled his hair, wore his mistress’s glove in his hat as a token of her affection, and slept with his mistress whenever she wanted. I swore oaths with every other word out of my mouth, and broke the oaths shamelessly. I used to dream of having sex and wake up to do it. I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem. I was disloyal and violent. I eavesdropped. I was as lazy as a hog, as sneaky as a fox, as greedy as a wolf, as mad as a dog, and as ruthless as a lion. Don’t ever let a woman know what you’re thinking. Stay away from whores, don’t chase skirts, don’t borrow money, and resist the devil. The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree. (speaking to an imaginary horse) Dauphin, my boy, stop that.—Let the horse go by. 
##The storm continues.
###LEAR
You’d be better off dead than facing the storm as naked as you are. Is this all a human being is? Look at him. (to EDGAR) You are not indebted to animals for your clothes since don’t wear silk, leather, or wool—not even perfume. Ha! The three of us are sophisticated compared to you. You’re the real thing. The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you. Off with these clothes borrowed from animals! Let me unbutton this. (he tears at his clothes) 
## GLOUCESTER enters with a torch.
###FOOL
Please calm down, uncle. This is a nasty night to go swimming. On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body. Look, here comes a walking fire. 
###EDGAR
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet. He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn. He can make your eyes squint and film over and give you a harelip. He rots ripened wheat and hurts the poor creatures of the earth. Saint Withold crossed the field three times, He met a she-demon and her nine kids, He told her to promise To stop doing harm. And go away, witch, go away. 
###KENT
How are you, your highness? 
###LEAR
(pointing at GLOUCESTER) Who’s that? 
###KENT
Who are you? What do you want? 
###GLOUCESTER
Who are you? What are your names? 
###EDGAR
Poor Tom, who eats frogs, toads, tadpoles, lizards, and newts. When the devil tells me to, I eat cow dung for salads, I swallow old rats and dead dogs, I drink pond scum. In every village I’m whipped and put in the stocks, punished and imprisoned. But I used to be a respectable servant, with three suits and six shirts. Once I had a horse to ride and a sword to wear, but now poor Tom’s been eating rats and mice for seven long years. Beware of the devil who follows me around. Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend! 
###GLOUCESTER
(to LEAR) Don’t you have anyone more respectable with you, your highness? 
###EDGAR
Oh, the devil is quite a gentleman. He’s called Modo and Mahu. 
###GLOUCESTER
(to LEAR) My lord, our children have become so beastly that they hate their own parents. 
###EDGAR
Poor Tom’s chilly. 
###GLOUCESTER
Come back to my house with me. I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders. They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food. 
###LEAR
First let me talk with this philosopher here.—(to EDGAR) What causes thunder? 
###KENT
(to LEAR) Sir, please take him up on his offer and go back with him. 
###LEAR
I want to chat a bit with this wise Greek man.—What kind of philosophy do you study? 
###EDGAR
How to keep the devil away and kill rats. 
###LEAR
Let me ask you something in private. 
## LEAR and EDGAR talk privately.
###KENT
(speaking so that only GLOUCESTER can hear) Ask him again to return with you, my lord. He’s beginning to lose his mind. 
###GLOUCESTER
Can you blame him? 
##The storm continues.
His daughters want to kill him. Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man. You say the king is losing his mind. Let me tell you, my friend, I’m almost insane myself. I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned. He tried to kill me recently, very recently. I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son. To tell you the truth, I’m crazed with grief. 
What a storm! (to LEAR) Your highness, please, I’m begging you— 
###LEAR
Excuse me, sir.—(to EDGAR) Noble philosopher, come talk to me. 
###EDGAR
Tom’s chilly. 
###GLOUCESTER
Get into the hut, man. Stay warm. 
###LEAR
Come on, let’s all go inside. 
###KENT
This way, my lord. 
###LEAR
(pointing to EDGAR) I’ll go with him. I want to stay with my philosopher. 
###KENT
(to GLOUCESTER) My lord, calm him down. Let him take that guy inside too. 
###GLOUCESTER
All right, bring him along. 
###KENT
(to EDGAR) Boy, come along with us. 
###LEAR
Come on, my dear Greek philosopher. 
###GLOUCESTER
Hush, don’t talk. 
###EDGAR
The young knight Roland came to the dark tower. He said, “Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.” 
##They all exit.
## CORNWALL enters with EDMUND.
###CORNWALL
I’ll get my revenge before I leave this house. 
###EDMUND
I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you. 
###CORNWALL
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man, but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself. 
###EDMUND
How unlucky am I, having to apologize for doing the right thing! (giving CORNWALL a letter) This is the letter he was talking about, and it confirms he was a spy for France. Oh God, I wish he had never betrayed us, or that I hadn’t been the one to discover his treason. 
###CORNWALL
Come with me to see the duchess. 
###EDMUND
If this letter’s right, you’ve got a lot to deal with. 
###CORNWALL
Right or not, it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester. Go find your father and let him know we’re going to arrest him. 
###EDMUND
(to himself) If I catch my father helping the king, he’ll seem even more guily. (to CORNWALL) I’ll do what I must loyally, even though it pains me to take action against my father. 
###CORNWALL
I put my trust in you. You’ll see that I’m a better father to you than Gloucester. 
##They exit.
## GLOUCESTER enters with LEAR, the FOOL, and KENT and EDGAR, both in disguise.
###GLOUCESTER
It’s better here than outside. Be happy about it. I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable. I won’t be gone long. 
###KENT
He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind. May God reward you for your kindness! 
## GLOUCESTER exits.
###EDGAR
The devil Frateretto is telling me that the diabolical Roman emperor Nero likes to go fishing in hell. Pray to the gods, you fool, and beware the foul devil. 
###FOOL
Here’s a riddle, uncle. Is the lunatic a gentleman or an ordinary guy? 
###LEAR
He’s a king, a king! 
###FOOL
No, he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son, since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself. 
###LEAR
I see Regan and Goneril in hell—A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them! 
###EDGAR
The nasty devil’s biting my butt. 
###FOOL
You’ve got to be crazy to trust a wolf that pretends to be tame, a horse that seems healthy, a teenager in love, or a whore who swears she’ll be faithful. 
###LEAR
I’ll do it. I’ll put them on trial right now. (to EDGAR) Come sit here, our able judge. (to FOOL) And you sit here, wise sir.—Now, you she-foxes— 
###EDGAR
There he is, standing and glaring at me!—Hey, lady, can’t you see how the judge is? (sings) Come over the stream to me, dear Bessy— 
###FOOL
(sings) She’s getting her period, And she won’t tell you Why she won’t come see you. 
###EDGAR
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom. The demon Hoppedance is in Tom’s belly, crying for some fish to eat. Stop whining, devil. I’ve got no food to give you. 
###KENT
(to LEAR) How are you, sir? Please don’t stand there in a daze. Wouldn’t you like to lie down on the pillows? 
###LEAR
No, I want to see their trial first. Let’s have the evidence. (to EDGAR) Take your place, honorable judge. (to FOOL) And you, his fellow justice of the peace, sit next to him. (to KENT) You can also be a judge. Sit down as well. 
###EDGAR
Let’s give a fair verdict. 
(sings) Are you asleep or awake, happy shepherd? Your sheep are running around the cornfield. But if you blow your cute little horn, Your sheep will be fine. Purr! The devil-cat is gray. 
###LEAR
Let’s put Goneril on trial first. There she is. I hereby swear before this honored assembly that she kicked her father when he was down. 
###FOOL
Come here, ma'am. Is your name Goneril? 
###LEAR
She can’t deny it. 
###FOOL
I’m so sorry, ma'am, I thought you were a good person, a well-made chair instead of a crude stool. 
###LEAR
And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart. Stop her! Guards, guards, use your weapons. Fire! The courtroom is in chaos. You corrupt judge, why did you let her escape? 
###EDGAR
Bless your heart. 
###KENT
(to LEAR) How sorrowful! Sir, where’s the self-control you used to be so proud of? 
###EDGAR
(to himself) I feel so sorry for him that my tears are starting to ruin my disguise. 
###LEAR
Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me. 
###EDGAR
Tom will chase them off.—Go away, you mongrels! Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt, 
Hound or spaniel, bitch or dog, Whether your tail is short or curly— Tom will make you cry and wail. With one little toss of his head, He can scare you off for good. Whether your mouth is black or white, Do-dee, dee-dee da. Stop! Run off, go visit fairs and festivals! Poor Tom, your cup is empty. 
###LEAR
Now let them dissect Regan and her hard heart. Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart? (to EDGAR) Sir, you can serve me as one of my hundred knights. But I don’t like your style of clothes. I’m sure you’ll tell me they’re fabulous, but I think you should change them anyway. 
###KENT
Please lie down and rest a while, my lord. 
###LEAR
Be quiet, be quiet. Draw the curtains, just like that. We’ll have supper in the morning. That’s right. (he falls asleep) 
###FOOL
And I’ll go to bed at noon. 
## GLOUCESTER enters.
###GLOUCESTER
(to KENT) Come here, my friend. Where’s my master the king? 
###KENT
He’s here, sir, but please don’t bother him. He’s out of his right mind. 
###GLOUCESTER
Please get him, my friend, I beg you. I’ve overheard people plotting to kill him. I have a carriage ready. Put 
him inside and take him to Dover, where you’ll find people who’ll welcome and protect him. Carry your master out. If you waste even half an hour, he’ll be killed, along with you and everyone else helping him. Bring him here, carry him and follow me. I’ll quickly take you to where you can find supplies. 
###KENT
Lear’s suffering has finally put him to sleep. (to the sleeping LEAR) This rest might have calmed your shattered nerves. It will be difficult for you to get better now that rest is impossible. (to FOOL) Come on, help me carry your master. You can’t stay here. 
###GLOUCESTER
Come on, come on. 
##Everyone exits except EDGAR.
###EDGAR
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do, we can almost forget our own misery. The person who suffers alone suffers the most. Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief. My troubles seem so easy to bear now that I see the king collapsing under a similar sorrow. His children have done the same to him as my father has to me. Let’s go, Tom. We’ll pay attention to the political situation, and you’ll be able to reveal your true identity when you’re proven innocent. Whatever else happens tonight, I hope the king escapes safely! Lurk out of sight. 
##He exits.
## CORNWALL enters with REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and servants.
###CORNWALL
(to GONERIL) Hurry to your husband. Show him this letter. The French army has landed.—Find the traitor Gloucester. 
##Some servants exit.
###REGAN
Hang him immediately. 
###GONERIL
Gouge out his eyes! 
###CORNWALL
Leave him to my wrath.—Edmund, go with my sister-in-law. You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father. Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately. We will do the same. We’ll keep the lines of communication open between us. (to GONERIL) Goodbye, my dear sister-in-law. (to EDMUND) Goodbye, lord Gloucester. 
## OSWALD enters.
Hello. Where’s the king? 
###OSWALD
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave. Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate, and together with some others they’ve set off for Dover, where they claim to have powerful friends. 
###CORNWALL
Prepare the horses for your lady. 
## OSWALD exits.
###GONERIL
Goodbye, my sweet lord.—Goodbye, my sister. 
###CORNWALL
Goodbye, Edmund. 
## GONERIL and EDMUND exit.
Go find the traitor Gloucester. Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me. 
##Some servants exit.
I can’t condemn him to death without a formal trial, but I’m powerful enough that I can still do something to express my anger. Some men may blame me for doing this, but they won’t be able to do anything about it.—Who’s there? Is that the traitor? 
##Two or three servants bring in GLOUCESTER.
###REGAN
Ungrateful traitor! That’s him. 
###CORNWALL
Tie up his withered old arms. 
###GLOUCESTER
What are you doing? My friends, remember that you’re my guests here. Don’t play any nasty tricks on me. 
###CORNWALL
Tie him up, I tell you. 
##Servants tie up GLOUCESTER.
###REGAN
Tie him up harder.—You filthy traitor! 
###GLOUCESTER
I’m not a traitor, unfair lady. 
###CORNWALL
Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— 
## REGAN pulls GLOUCESTER’s beard.
###GLOUCESTER
By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard. 
###REGAN
As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor? 
###GLOUCESTER
Wicked woman, these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing. You are my guests. This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house. What do you think you’re doing? 
###CORNWALL
Tell us about the letters that you got from France. 
###REGAN
Get to the point, since we already know the truth. 
###CORNWALL
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently? 
###REGAN
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to. Tell us. 
###GLOUCESTER
I got a letter that made some guesses about what was going on, without any proof. It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you. 
###CORNWALL
How clever of you. 
###REGAN
Clever lies. 
###CORNWALL
Where have you sent the king? 
###GLOUCESTER
To Dover. 
###REGAN
Why Dover? Weren’t you ordered, on penalty of— 
###CORNWALL
Why Dover?—Let him answer that question first. 
###GLOUCESTER
I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run. 
###REGAN
Why Dover? 
###GLOUCESTER
Because I didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails, or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh. You left him out in the storm in the black night, bareheaded, a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea, the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars. And the poor old man just wept, mixing his tears with the rain. If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm, you would’ve told your doorman to let them in, despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world. But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father. 
###CORNWALL
You won’t be seeing anything.—Hold his chair still, men.—I’m going to put my foot on his eyes. 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, help me, anyone who wants to live long! 
## CORNWALL gouges out one of GLOUCESTER’s eyes and steps on it.
Oh, so cruel! Oh dear gods! 
###REGAN
Now he’s a little crooked. Gouge out the other eye too. 
###CORNWALL
If you see vengeance— 
###FIRST SERVANT
Stop, my lord! I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop. 
###REGAN
What’s this, you dog? 
###FIRST SERVANT
I am willing to fight you if I must. What do you mean by all this? 
###CORNWALL
My peasant, acting like this? 
###FIRST SERVANT
Come on then. Over my dead body. 
##The FIRST SERVANT and CORNWALL draw swords and fight. CORNWALL is wounded.
###REGAN
(to another servant) Give me your sword.—A lowly peasant defying his lord like this? She takes a sword and stabs the FIRST SERVANT from behind, killing him. 
###FIRST SERVANT
I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished. Oh!(he dies) 
###CORNWALL
We’ll just have to stop him from seeing ever again. Out, vile jelly, pop out of your eye sockets! 
(he gouges out GLOUCESTER’s other eye) Where’s your sparkle now? 
###GLOUCESTER
Nothing but darkness and horror. Where’s my son Edmund? Edmund, let your love for me ignite your bloodlust to avenge this horrible crime! 
###REGAN
Wrong, evil traitor. You’re appealing to a son who hates you. He was the one who revealed your treason to us. He’s too good to have any compassion for you. 
###GLOUCESTER
What a fool I’ve been! This means I’ve mistreated Edgar. Dear God, forgive me. Let him be well! 
###REGAN
Kick him out of the gate. He can sniff his way to Dover. 
##Some servants exit with GLOUCESTER.
(to CORNWALL) What is it, my lord? Why do you look like that? 
###CORNWALL
I’m wounded. Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside. And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—Regan, I’m bleeding. It’s a bad time for such an injury. Give me your arm. 
## CORNWALL and REGAN exit.
###SECOND SERVANT
If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore. 
###THIRD SERVANT
If she lives a long and happy life, then all women may as well turn into monsters. 
###SECOND SERVANT
Let’s follow the old earl, and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go. As a wandering lunatic, he can do whatever he wants. 
###THIRD SERVANT
Go ahead. I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face. Heaven help him! 
##They exit in different directions.
## EDGAR enters in disguise.
###EDGAR
Still, I’m better off now, as a beggar who is openly hated, than when I was flattered to my face hated in secret. The lowliest and most dejected creatures live without fear and still harbor hope. The worst kind of change is when good fortune turns sour. At the bottom, any change is for the better. So I welcome this wind freely. I’ve sunk as far down as I can go, so I’ve got nothing more to fear from the weather. 
## GLOUCESTER enters, led by an OLD MAN.
But who is this? My father, led by a poor peasant? Oh, life is full of surprises! We age and die because they wear us out. 
###OLD MAN
(to GLOUCESTER) My good lord, I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years. 
###GLOUCESTER
Away, get out of here. Leave me, my friend. There’s nothing you can do to help me now, and being with me puts your life in danger. 
###OLD MAN
But you can’t see where you’re going, sir. 
###GLOUCESTER
I don’t have anywhere to go, so I don’t need to see. When I could see, I didn’t always see clearly. I made 
mistakes, I stumbled and fell. It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled, while not having it turns out to be advantageous. So may it be with my eyesight. Oh, my dear son Edgar, how enraged I was at you when I was deceived. If I live long enough to touch you again, that would be as good as having my eyesight back. 
###OLD MAN
Who’s that? Who’s there? 
###EDGAR
(to himself) Oh, gods! Who can ever say, “This is as bad as it can get”? I’m worse off now than ever before. 
###OLD MAN
(to GLOUCESTER) It’s poor crazy Tom. 
###EDGAR
(to himself) And my life could still be worse. If you have the presence of mind to say, “This is the worst,” then it’s not the worst yet. 
###OLD MAN
(to EDGAR) Where are you going, man? 
###GLOUCESTER
Is it a beggar? 
###OLD MAN
Yes, he’s both crazy and a beggar. 
###GLOUCESTER
Well, he can’t be completely crazy, or he wouldn’t be able to beg. Last night during the storm I saw a man who was both poor and crazy. He made me think that men are as weak and insignificant as worms. I was reminded of my son, even though I despised my son at that time. Now I know better. The gods play around with us as cruelly as schoolboys who pull the wings off flies. 
###EDGAR
(to himself) What’s going on? I hate pretending I’m a wandering beggar when all I want to do now is comfort my poor father.—Bless you, master. 
###GLOUCESTER
Is that the naked guy? 
###OLD MAN
Yes, my lord. 
###GLOUCESTER
(to the OLD MAN) Then please go. If you’re willing to do me a favor, as an old friend, then catch up to us a mile or two further on the way to Dover, and bring some clothes for this poor beggar. I’ll ask him to be my guide. 
###OLD MAN
But sir, he’s crazy. 
###GLOUCESTER
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind. Do as I asked you. Or rather, do what you feel like doing. But above all, get out of here. 
###OLD MAN
I’ll bring the crazy beggar the best clothes I have, no matter what happens. 
##He exits.
###GLOUCESTER
Hey, naked guy— 
###EDGAR
Poor Tom’s chilly. (to himself) I can’t play this role any longer. 
###GLOUCESTER
Come here, man. 
###EDGAR
(to himself) But I must.—Bless you, sir. Your dear eyes are bleeding. 
###GLOUCESTER
Do you know the way to Dover? 
###EDGAR
I know it like the back of my hand, every step of the way. Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind. Bless you, good man, and stay away from the devil. Five devils haunted Poor Tom at the same time: Obidicut, the devil of lust; Hobbididence, the devil of mutes; Mahu, the devil of stealing; Modo, the devil of murder; and Flibbertigibbet, the devil of mockery, who causes chambermaids to make silly faces. Bless you, master. 
###GLOUCESTER
(giving EDGAR a purse) Here, take some money. The torments of heaven have brought you down to this humble state. My misery makes you more fortunate in comparison. It should always work like that. The spoiled man who has everything, who can’t see the misery around him because he doesn’t feel it himself, should be made to feel agony so he can learn to share his wealth. That way wealth would be redistributed until everyone has enough to survive. Are you familiar with Dover? 
###EDGAR
Yes, sir. 
###GLOUCESTER
There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea. Take me to the edge of it, and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable. Once I’m there, I won’t need a guide anymore. 
###EDGAR
Give me your arm. Poor Tom will take you there. 
##They exit.
## GONERIL enters with EDMUND.
###GONERIL
Welcome, my lord. I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here. 
## OSWALD enters.
Where’s your master? 
###OSWALD
He’s inside, ma'am, but he has changed dramatically since you last saw him. When I told him that the invading army has landed, he just smiled at me. When I told him you were on your way, he replied, “Too bad.” When I told him about Gloucester’s betrayal and his son Edmund’s loyal service, he called me an idiot and said I had it all wrong. He was delighted by the bad news and disgusted by the good news. 
###GONERIL
(to EDMUND) Then don’t come in with me. He’s a coward and can’t commit himself to doing anything risky. He chooses not to be insulted rather than challenge those who offend him. But what we talked about with longing on the way may soon come true. Edmund, go back to see my brother-in-law. Gather his soldiers and organize his troops. I plan to take charge of my household. From now on I will wear the pants, and my husband can play the housewife. We can trust Oswald to carry messages between us. If you act boldly, you will soon obey me as your true mistress. Take this as a token of my esteem. Don’t speak. Lean down. This kiss should encourage you. (she kisses EDMUND ) I hope you understand me. Goodbye, and good luck. 
###EDMUND
I’m at your service until death. 
###GONERIL
My dear Gloucester! 
## EDMUND exits.
What a man!—especially compared to my husband. Edmund, you deserve me to be your woman. There’s a fool sharing my bed now. 
###OSWALD
Ma'am, my master’s coming. 
##He exits.
## ALBANY enters.
###GONERIL
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions. 
###ALBANY
Goneril, you aren’t worth the dust the wind blows in your face. I don’t trust you. You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father, her flesh and blood. A woman who breaks off relations with her bloodline is like a branch that tries to break away from the tree. She will wither and come to a bad end. 
###GONERIL
Oh, shut up. Your words are idiotic. 
###ALBANY
Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness. They only like things as bad as themselves. What have you two sisters done? You’re tigers, not daughters. Barbaric degenerates, you’ve driven insane a kindly old father, whom even an angry bear would treat gent-ly. Could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the 
king gave half his kingdom—have allowed you to do it? If the heavens don’t punish these crimes immediately, the end will come. Human beings will become cannibals, like ravenous sea fishes. 
###GONERIL
Coward! You take everything lying down, you just turn the other cheek—you can’t even see the difference between being honored and being taken advantage of! If we punish criminals before they have a chance to commit their crimes, you’re a fool to pity them. Why aren’t you preparing for war? The French have invaded our peaceful country. Your territory is at risk, and all you can do is sit around like a preachy fool and whine, “Ah, why is he doing that?” 
###ALBANY
Look at yourself, devilish shrew! A woman deformed by hatred and rage is more horrifying than the devil!—at least the devil is supposed to look that way. 
###GONERIL
You useless fool! 
###ALBANY
Shame on you, warped hag! Your true demonic features are distorting your body. If I let myself do what I yearn to, I’d rip the flesh off your bones. But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon. 
###GONERIL
I sneeze on your manhood. Ha! 
##The FIRST MESSENGER enters.
###ALBANY
What news do you bring? 
###FIRST MESSENGER
Oh my lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead. He was killed by his servant as he about to gouge out Glouces-ter’s other eye. 
###ALBANY
Gloucester’s eyes? 
###FIRST MESSENGER
A servant Gloucester had raised in his house, full of compunction, opposed the blinding and turned his sword on the Duke of Cornwall. Enraged, Cornwall attacked and killed the servant, but not without receiving his own wound, of which he later died. 
###ALBANY
There’s justice in heaven after all! That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof. But oh, poor Glou-cester! Did he lose his other eye? 
###FIRST MESSENGER
He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer. 
###GONERIL
(to herself) In a way I’m glad to hear that Cornwall is dead. But on the other hand, Edmund is traveling with Regan, who is now a widow. If something happens between them on the road, it would shatter my hopes of having Edmund for myself and escaping this hateful life. Still, there are benefits to having Cornwall out of the way.—I’ll read this letter and answer it. 
##She exits.
###ALBANY
Where was Gloucester’s son Edmund when they gouged his eyes out? 
###FIRST MESSENGER
He was on his way here with your wife. 
###ALBANY
But he isn’t here now. 
###FIRST MESSENGER
No, my lord. I met him going back again. 
###ALBANY
Does he know about this wicked crime? 
###FIRST MESSENGER
Yes, my lord. He was the one who denounced his father. He then left the house specifically so that the punishment might be carried out without concern for their father-son bond. 
###ALBANY
Gloucester, I’ll thank you forever for the love you’ve shown the king. I’ll get revenge for what they did to your eyes.—Come here, my friend. What else you do know? 
##They exit.
## KENT enters in disguise, along with the GENTLEMAN.
###KENT
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home? 
###GENTLEMAN
He’d left some unfinished business, which he remembered after arriving here. It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence. 
###KENT
Whom did he leave in charge here? 
###GENTLEMAN
The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far. 
###KENT
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered? 
###GENTLEMAN
Yes, sir. She took the letters and read them in front of me. Now and then a large tear trickled down her delicate cheek. She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her. 
###KENT
So she was moved by it? 
###GENTLEMAN
There were no outbursts. She was struggling between emotion and self-control. You’ve seen how it can rain while the sun shines? That’s how she was, smiling and crying at once, only more lovely. The little smile on her full lips didn’t seem aware of the tears that were dropping like diamonds from her pearly eyes. If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized. 
###KENT
She didn’t ask anything? 
###GENTLEMAN
Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest. Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you! Kent, father, sisters! What, out in a storm in the middle of the night? I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water. Then she ran away to grieve alone. 
###KENT
It must be fate that makes us who we are—otherwise someone as good as Cordelia could not possibly be related to those two witches. Have you not spoken to her since then? 
###GENTLEMAN
No. 
###KENT
Did this happen before the King of France returned home? 
###GENTLEMAN
No, afterward. 
###KENT
Well, sir, poor delirious Lear is in town. Sometimes when he’s lucid he remembers why we’re here, and absolutely refuses to see his daughter. 
###GENTLEMAN
Why, good sir? 
###KENT
He’s too overwhelmed with shame. He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters. All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia. 
###GENTLEMAN
Oh, the poor man! 
###KENT
Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops? 
###GENTLEMAN
I have. They’re on the march. 
###KENT
Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while. I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer. When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out. Please come with me. 
##They exit.
## CORDELIA enters with a DOCTOR and soldiers carrying drums and banners.
###CORDELIA
Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing. They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him. Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him. 
##Some soldiers exit.
What can human knowledge do to make him sane again? I’d give all my wealth to whoever can help him. 
###DOCTOR
There is a way, ma'am. Nature heals people with rest, which Lear hasn’t had. But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while. 
###CORDELIA
Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow. May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering. Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger. 
##The SECOND MESSENGER enters.
###SECOND MESSENGER
I have news, ma'am. The British forces are on their way here. 
###CORDELIA
We already knew that. Our forces are ready for them. Oh, father, I’m taking care of your business. That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears. We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom. I hope I see him and hear him again soon. 
##They all exit.
## REGAN enters with OSWALD.
###REGAN
Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized? 
###OSWALD
Yes, ma'am. 
###REGAN
Is he there in person? 
###OSWALD
Yes, making a big fuss. Your sister’s the better soldier of the two. 
###REGAN
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home? 
###OSWALD
No, ma'am. 
###REGAN
What could my sister’s letter to him say? 
###OSWALD
I don’t know, ma'am. 
###REGAN
He rushed away on serious business. It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him. Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us. I think Edmund went off to kill him, to put him out of his blind misery. And also to find out the size of the enemy army. 
###OSWALD
I have to follow him and give him the letter. 
###REGAN
Our troops are deployed tomorrow. Stay with us tonight. It’s dangerous out there. 
###OSWALD
I can’t, ma'am. My lady ordered me to deliver her letter. 
###REGAN
Why would she write to Edmund? Couldn’t you just deliver the message orally? It probably has something to do with… I don’t know. I’ll be so grateful to you if you let me open that letter. 
###OSWALD
Ma'am, I’d rather— 
###REGAN
I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband. I’m sure of that. And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances. I know she trusts you and tells you everything. 
###OSWALD
Me, ma'am? 
###REGAN
I know what I’m talking about. You’re close to her, I know it. So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say. My husband is dead. Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril. You can figure out the rest. If you find him, please give him this. And when your mistress hears about all this, please tell her to use her head next time. So goodbye. If you happen to hear anything about that blind traitor Gloucester, I’ll reward anyone who snuffs him out. 
###OSWALD
If I could run into him, ma'am, I’d prove which side I’m on. 
###REGAN
Goodbye. 
##They exit in opposite directions.
## GLOUCESTER enters with EDGAR, who is dressed as a peasant.
###GLOUCESTER
When will we get to the top of that cliff? 
###EDGAR
We’re walking up to the top right now. See how hard it is to climb? 
###GLOUCESTER
The ground feels flat to me. 
###EDGAR
No, it’s dreadfully steep. Listen. Do you hear the sea? 
###GLOUCESTER
No, really, I don’t. 
###EDGAR
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness. 
###GLOUCESTER
It may be so. It seems to me that your voice has changed, and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be. 
###EDGAR
You’re mistaken about all that. The only thing different about me is my clothes. 
###GLOUCESTER
I think you’re more articulate. 
###EDGAR
Come on, sir. This is the place. Stand still. It’s so scary to look down! It makes me dizzy. The crows flying down below look as small as ants. Halfway down the cliff there’s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs—a risky business! He looks like a dot to me. The fishermen walking along the beach are as small as mice. That big ship over there looks no bigger 
than its lifeboat, and its lifeboat looks as small as a tiny buoy. Up here you can’t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks. I have to stop looking, or my head will start spinning and I’ll fall. 
###GLOUCESTER
Lead me to where you’re standing. 
###EDGAR
Give me your hand. You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge. I wouldn’t try to jump up and down here for anything on earth. 
###GLOUCESTER
Let go of my hand. (he gives EDGAR another purse) Here’s another purse, my friend. Inside it there’s a jewel that any poor man would be happy to have. I hope it’s only the beginning of future prosperity for you. Now go further away. Say goodbye to me, and let me hear your footsteps as you walk away. 
###EDGAR
Goodbye, good sir. 
###GLOUCESTER
With all my heart. 
## EDGAR moves aside.
###EDGAR
(to himself) I’m toying with his despair to cure him of it. 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, you mighty gods! (he kneels) I hereby renounce this world and all my troubles and torments. If I could bear them better, and not fight against your unstoppable decisions, then I would simply wait until I expired naturally. If Edgar’s alive, bless him, gods!—Now, man, goodbye. (he falls) 
###EDGAR
Gone, sir. Goodbye. (to himself) But I still wonder if it’s possible for his own imagination to kill him, since he’s so willing to die. If he’d been standing on the edge of the cliff as he thought, he’d be dead right now. Is he alive or dead?—Hey, sir, friend! Can you hear me? Answer me.—Maybe he passed away after all. But no, he’s stirring.—Who are you, sir? 
###GLOUCESTER
Go away and let me die. 
###EDGAR
Even if you were made of feathers and air, you should’ve been smashed in pieces like an egg after falling as far as you just did. But your flesh is solid, your mind is strong, you’re breathing and talking, you’re not bleeding. You just fell the height of ten ship masts, straight down. It’s a miracle you’re alive. Say something again. 
###GLOUCESTER
But did I fall or not? 
###EDGAR
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff. Look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there? The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard. Just look. 
###GLOUCESTER
I can’t. I have no eyes. If you’re wretched and desperate, aren’t you allowed to kill yourself? It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people. 
###EDGAR
Give me your arm. Get up. There you go. How do you feel? Can you feel your legs? You’re standing. 
###GLOUCESTER
Only too well. 
###EDGAR
This is beyond weird. What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell? 
###GLOUCESTER
That was a poor unlucky beggar. 
###EDGAR
From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons. He had a thousand noses and twisted horns, like wave crests in a storm at sea. It was some devil. You lucky old man, it seems that the gods have saved your life. They love to perform miracles so that humans will worship them. 
###GLOUCESTER
I understand now. From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out, “Enough, enough!” and disappears. I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man. It would often talk about the devil. It took me to that deadly place. 
###EDGAR
Cheer up and be at peace. 
## LEAR enters, insane.
But who is that? A sane person would never dress like this. 
###LEAR
No, they can’t accuse me of counterfeiting coins. I’m the king himself. 
###EDGAR
(to himself) Oh, what a heartbreaking sight! 
###LEAR
Life’s better at breaking hearts than art is.—Hey, a new recruit. Here’s your enlistment bonus.—Look how awkwardly he handles his crossbow.—Come on, pull it back farther!—Look, look, a mouse! Calm down, this 
piece of cheese will get him.—I challenge you to a match. I’ll even fight a giant.—Call out the infantry. —Oh, that arrow was well shot. Whoosh! Right in the bull’s eye.–—What’s the password? 
###EDGAR
Sweet marjoram. 
###LEAR
That’s it! 
###GLOUCESTER
I know that voice. 
###LEAR
Ha! Goneril with a white beard? Ha, Regan?—They flattered me and told me how wise I was, wise before my time. To agree to everything I said was not truly devout.—The rain came to drench me, and the wind to make me shiver, and the thunder wouldn’t stop roaring when I ordered it to. That’s when I learned the truth about them. That’s when I sniffed them out. I tell you, they are not honest men. They told me I was everything. It’s a lie. I’m not immune to chills. 
###GLOUCESTER
I recognize something about that voice. Isn’t that the king? 
###LEAR
Yes, every inch a king. My subjects tremble when I look at them. I pardon that man. What are you accused of? Adultery? I’ll commute your death sentence. To die for adultery? No. Little birds do it, and dragonflies copulate right in front of me. Let’s have more sex in the world, since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters, conceived in lawful wedlock, have been to me. Get to it, be lustful, sleep around—I need soldiers for my army. Look at that simpering lady over there. From looking at her face, I’d say she’s 
frigid. She pretends to be virtuous and to disdain the word “sex, but she’s hornier than a passel of rabbits. Women are sex machines below the waist, though they’re chaste up above. Above the waist they belong to God, but the lower part belongs to the devil. That’s where hell is, and darkness, and fires and stench! Death and orgasm! Ah, ah, ah! Give me an aphrodisiac, pharmacist. Let me have sweet dreams. There’s money in it for you. 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, let me kiss his hand! 
###LEAR
Let me wipe it off first. It stinks of death. 
###GLOUCESTER
A ruined man! This is how the whole world will end up, worn away to nothing.—Do you know who I am? 
###LEAR
I remember your eyes quite well. Are you squinting at me? Go ahead, try to make me fall in love, blind Cupid. I won’t ever love again. Read this letter. Just look at the handwriting. 
###GLOUCESTER
If every letter on that page were a sun, I couldn’t see even one of them. 
###EDGAR
(to himself) I wouldn’t believe this if I weren’t seeing it with my own eyes. It’s real, and it breaks my heart. 
###LEAR
Read it. 
###GLOUCESTER
How? With my eye sockets? 
###LEAR
Oh ho, is that what you’re getting at? You want money before you’ll read? No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet? Your eyes are in a bad way, your wallet’s empty, but you understand the ways of the world. 
###GLOUCESTER
I do understand, by touch. 
###LEAR
What, are you crazy? You don’t need eyes to see how the world works. Look with your ears. Look how the judge yells at a simple thief. Listen. But mix them up, have them switch places, and do you think you’d be able to tell which one is which? Have you seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar? 
###GLOUCESTER
Yes, sir. 
###LEAR
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt? That’s authority! Even a dog is obeyed sometimes. You stupid cop, stop your violence! Why are you whipping that whore? You should be whipping yourself, since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her. One criminal punishes another. Poor men’s sins are much more noticeable than rich men’s. Cover up a crime with gold and the arm of justice can’t touch it. But dress the crime in rags and it’s caught easily. Everyone sins. You can’t blame anyone for it anyone, I say. I’ll vouch for that. Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors. Get yourself some glass eyes, and pretend to see things you can’t, like a crooked politician. Now, now, now, now. Pull off my boots. Harder, harder. Like that. 
###EDGAR
(to himself) Oh, wisdom and absurdity mixed up together! Reason in madness! 
###LEAR
If you want to cry over my bad luck, I’ll give you my eyes. I know you. Your name’s Gloucester. You have to be patient with me. I came here crying. The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream. I’ll read you a sermon. Listen to this. 
###GLOUCESTER
Oh, how awful! 
###LEAR
When we’re born, we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life, like all the other fools. That’s a nice hat you’ve got there. How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt. I’ll test it out. And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! 
##The GENTLEMAN enters with two other gentlemen.
###GENTLEMAN
(noticing LEAR) Oh, here he is. Grab him.—Sir, your most dear daughter— 
###LEAR
What, I’m a prisoner? No rescue for me? My luck has always been bad. Treat me well. There’s a ransom. I need a doctor. My brains are injured. 
###GENTLEMAN
You can have anything you want. 
###LEAR
Will no one back me up? Am I all alone? That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears. 
###GENTLEMAN
Good sir— 
###LEAR
I’ll die courageously, like a well-dressed bridegroom. Okay, I’ll be cheery. I’m king. Did you know that, gentlemen? 
###GENTLEMAN
You’re of royal blood, and we obey you. 
###LEAR
Then there’s still a chance. Come and get it! But you’ll have to catch me! Catch me if you can! Sa, sa, sa, sa. 
## LEAR exits running, chased by two gentlemen.
###GENTLEMAN
This is a difficult to see even in a beggar. In a king, the sight is unbearable. He has a daughter good enough to cancel out the wickedness of the other two. 
###EDGAR
Hello, good sir. 
###GENTLEMAN
How do you do, sir. How can I help you? 
###EDGAR
Have you heard any news of impending battle? 
###GENTLEMAN
Certainly. Everyone who can hear has heard about it. 
###EDGAR
Could you tell me how near the enemy is? 
###GENTLEMAN
Very near, and approaching fast. The main body of the army is expected here any hour now. 
###EDGAR
Thank you, sir. That’s all I wanted to know. 
###GENTLEMAN
The queen is here on special business, and her army has moved on. 
###EDGAR
Thank you, sir. 
##The GENTLEMAN exits.
###GLOUCESTER
Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die. Don’t tempt me to suicide again. 
###EDGAR
Pray well, father. 
###GLOUCESTER
And who are you, good sir? 
###EDGAR
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes. I’ve had enough sorrow in my life to feel compassion for others. Give me your hand. I’ll lead you to some shelter. 
###GLOUCESTER
Thank you very much. May heaven bless you. 
## OSWALD enters.
###OSWALD
What good luck! I’ll get the promised reward. That blind head of yours was created to make me rich. You old traitor, repent all your sins. Prepare to die. 
###GLOUCESTER
Death is exactly what I want. I hope you’re strong enough to do it. 
## EDGAR steps in between GLOUCESTER and OSWALD.
###OSWALD
Whoa, man, you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor? Get out of here, before his bad luck infects you too. Let go of his arm. 
###EDGAR
Oh no, sir, I won’t let him go, sir, not without a good reason. 
###OSWALD
Let go of him, peasant, or you die! 
###EDGAR
Get on with your business, sir, and leave the poor people alone. If macho talk like yours could kill me, I’d have died weeks ago. No, don’t come near the old man. Keep away, I’m warning you, or I’ll find out whether your head is harder than my walking stick. I’m completely serious. 
###OSWALD
Get out of here, you pile of crap. 
###EDGAR
I’ll knock your teeth out, sir. To hell with your sword. 
## EDGAR and OSWALD fight.
###OSWALD
(falling) You peasant, you’ve killed me! Villain, take my money. If you survive, make sure I have a decent burial. Give the letters I’m carrying to Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. He’s with the English camp. Oh, early death! (he dies) 
###EDGAR
I know you well. You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to. 
###GLOUCESTER
Is he dead? 
###EDGAR
Sit down and rest, father. Let’s look in his pockets. The letters he spoke of may help me. He’s dead. I’m just sorry I had to be the one to kill him. Let’s see here. (takes letters out of OSWALD’s pocket and opens them) Come on, envelope, open up for me. I know it’s bad manners, but we kill our enemies to know their secrets. Reading their mail isn’t as bad. (reads) “Don’t forget the vows we made to each other. You have many chances to kill Albany. If you have the strength of will to do it, you’ll have many opportunities. If he returns in triumph, then all is lost. I’ll be his prisoner, and his bed will be my prison. Help me escape him, and you can take his place. Your—I wish I could say “wife”—loving servant, who is ready to love you,      Goneril.” Is there no limit to women’s lust? She’s plotting against the life of her virtuous husband, and wants my brother to replace him! (to the dead OSWALD) I’ll bury you here in a shallow grave, you messenger for lustful criminals. In due time I’ll show this ugly letter to the duke whose life’s at risk. It’s a good thing for him that I can tell him about your death and the letter you were carrying. 
###GLOUCESTER
The king is insane. I hate the fact that I’m sane enough to be aware of my own great suffering. It’d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything. Then my mind would be free of sorrow, and sadness would be forgotten in my hallucinations. 
##Drums play in the distance.
###EDGAR
Give me your hand. I think I hear the drums far away. Come, father, I’ll leave you at a friend’s house. 
##They exit.
## CORDELIA enters with KENT in disguise, the GENTLEMAN, and the DOCTOR.
###CORDELIA
Oh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are? I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me. 
###KENT
Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam. I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less. 
###CORDELIA
Change into better clothes. These rags will just remind us of those bad times when you had to wear a disguise. Please take them off. 
###KENT
I’m sorry, madam, but I can’t do that yet. If people recognize me now, I won’t be able to carry out my plans. I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right. 
###CORDELIA
All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing? 
###DOCTOR
He’s still sleeping, ma'am. 
###CORDELIA
Kind gods, heal the wounds that he’s wrongly suffered! Restore the sanity of this father whose children have driven him mad and changed him into a child again! 
###DOCTOR
Would you mind if we woke up the king? He’s slept a long time. 
###CORDELIA
Do whatever you think best. Is he in his royal garments? 
##Servants carry in LEAR sleeping in a chair.
###GENTLEMAN
Yes, ma'am. We changed his clothes while he was fast asleep. 
###DOCTOR
Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am. I’m sure he will stay under control. 
###CORDELIA
All right. 
###DOCTOR
Please come closer.— Make the music louder, please! 
###CORDELIA
(kisses LEAR) Oh, my dear father, please get better. May my kiss heal the wounds inflicted on you by my sisters—who should have respected and cherished you. 
###KENT
Kind and dear princess! 
###CORDELIA
If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion. Is this a face that should have endured the freezing winds or withstood the dreadful thunder or the terrible lightning? To stay awake all night like a guardsman—poor lost soul!—with only your thinning hair for a helmet? I would’ve let even my enemy’s nastiest dog stay inside by the fireplace on that night, even if he had bit me. And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums? Oh, oh! It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up. Talk to him. 
###DOCTOR
You talk to him, ma'am. That’s most appropriate. 
###CORDELIA
How are you, my royal lord? How is your majesty doing? 
###LEAR
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave. You’re a soul in heaven, but I’m tied to the fiery wheel of a torture machine in hell. Even my tears burn me like molten lead. 
###CORDELIA
Sir, do you know who I am? 
###LEAR
You’re a spirit, I know. Where did you die? 
###CORDELIA
(whispering to the DOCTOR) He’s still in outer space. 
###DOCTOR
He’s still half asleep. Let him be for a bit. 
###LEAR
Where have I been? Where am I? Is it daytime? I’ve been tricked. I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition. I don’t know what to say. I can’t even be sure these are my hands. Let’s see. I feel this pinprick. I wish I knew what is happening. 
###CORDELIA
(kneeling) Look at me, sir, and give me your blessing. No, sir, don’t kneel. 
###LEAR
Please don’t make fun of me. I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less. To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane. I feel I should recognize you and that man (he points to KENT), 
but I’m not sure. I don’t know where I am. I don’t remember these clothes. I can’t recall where I slept last night. Don’t laugh at me, but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia. 
###CORDELIA
And I am, I am. 
###LEAR
Are your tears wet? Yes, indeed they are. Please don’t cry. If you have poison for me, I’ll drink it. I know you don’t love me. If I remember, your sisters did me wrong for no reason. But you didn’t, even though you had every reason. 
###CORDELIA
I had no reason, no reason. 
###LEAR
Am I in France? 
###KENT
You’re in your own kingdom, sir. 
###LEAR
Don’t deceive me. 
###DOCTOR
You can relax, ma'am. His insane period is over. But it’s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost. Ask him to go in. Don’t trouble him further until his mind is more settled. 
###CORDELIA
Would your highness like to take a walk? 
###LEAR
You’ll have to bear with me. Please forgive and forget. I’m old and foolish. 
##They exit.
## KENT and the GENTLEMAN remain.
###GENTLEMAN
Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say? 
###KENT
Yes, it’s true, sir. 
###GENTLEMAN
Who is leading his men? 
###KENT
They say Gloucester’s bastard son is. 
###GENTLEMAN
I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany. 
###KENT
You can’t trust all the rumors. It’s time to reassess the situation. The British troops are coming near. 
###GENTLEMAN
It will likely be a bloody fight. Goodbye, sir. 
##He exits.
###KENT
My life and my plans completely depend on how today’s battle ends. 
##He exits.
## EDMUND, REGAN, gentlemen, and soldiers enter with drums and banners.
###EDMUND
(to a gentleman) Go find out from the Duke of Albany if his decision still holds, or if he’s changed his mind. He’s always going back and forth and second-guessing himself. Come back and tell me what his final decision is. 
##Gentleman exits.
###REGAN
My sister’s servant Oswald has certainly run into trouble. 
###EDMUND
I’m afraid that may be the case, madam. 
###REGAN
Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you. Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister? 
###EDMUND
Yes, truly and honorably. 
###REGAN
But have you ever gone in my brother-in-law’s bed and had sex with her? 
###EDMUND
No. You dishonor yourself and our relationship by thinking that. 
###REGAN
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her. 
###EDMUND
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam. 
###REGAN
I can’t stand her. Please, my lord, don’t be friendly with her. 
###EDMUND
Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here. 
## ALBANY, GONERIL, and soldiers enter with drums and banners.
###GONERIL
(to herself) I’d rather lose this battle than allow that sister of mine to come between me and Edmund. 
###ALBANY
My dear and loving sister-in-law, I’m happy to see you. (to EDMUND) Sir, I’ve heard that the king has joined up with his daughter as well as others who have complained about our strict policies. I’ve never fought for a cause I didn’t believe in. I’m concerned about the French because they have invaded our soil, not because they support King Lear or those others—who, I’m afraid, may have legitimate grievances against us. 
###EDMUND
Noble words, sir. 
###REGAN
Why are we talking about this? 
###GONERIL
We must join forces against the enemy. Our domestic squabbles are not the issue here. 
###ALBANY
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next. 
###EDMUND
I’ll meet you at your tent. 
###REGAN
Goneril, are you coming with us? 
###GONERIL
No. 
###REGAN
It’s the best thing to do. Please come with me. 
###GONERIL
(to herself) Oh ho, I know her little tricks.—Okay, I’ll go. 
## EDGAR enters, disguised as a peasant.
###EDGAR
(to ALBANY) If you can stoop to speak to a man as poor as I am, then listen to me, please. 
###ALBANY
(to EDMUND, REGAN, and GONERIL exiting) I’ll catch up with you.— 
##Everyone exits except ALBANY and EDGAR.
Go ahead. 
###EDGAR
(giving ALBANY a letter) Before you go into battle, open this letter. If you win, then blow your trumpet as a signal for me. I may look wretched, but I’ll bravely stand up to defend my claims. If you die in battle, all your projects and this plan are off. Good luck to you. 
###ALBANY
Wait until I read the letter. 
###EDGAR
I was ordered not to. When the time comes, tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return. 
###ALBANY
Goodbye, then. I’ll take a look at your letter. 
## EDGAR exits.
## EDMUND enters.
###EDMUND
The enemy’s in sight. Prepare your troops. (gives ALBANY a document) The reconnaissance operation has returned this estimate of the enemy’s manpower and weaponry. But now, please hurry. 
###ALBANY
We’ll be ready when the time comes. 
##He exits.
###EDMUND
I’ve sworn my love to both of these sisters. They’re jealous of each other like poisonous snakes. Which one of them should I pick? Both? One? Neither? I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive. Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive. I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him. Albany wants to spare Lear and Cordelia, but once they are my prisoners after the battle, they won’t stay alive long enough to see his pardon. I have to defend my position with actions, not words. 
##He exits.
##Sounds of battle offstage. CORDELIA enters hand in hand with LEAR, accompanied by drums, banners, and French troops. They cross the stage and exit.
## EDGAR enters, disguised, along with GLOUCESTER.
###EDGAR
Here, father, rest awhile in the shade of this tree. Say a little prayer for our side in battle. If I ever come back, I’ll bring you good news. 
###GLOUCESTER
Good luck, sir. 
## EDGAR exits.
##Sounds of battle offstage. They grow fainter.
## EDGAR returns.
###EDGAR
We have to get out of here, old man. Let me help you up. Let’s go! King Lear’s been defeated. He and his daughter are captured. Give me your hand. Come on. 
###GLOUCESTER
I can’t go any further, sir. This is as good a place as any to die. 
###EDGAR
Are you depressed again? You can’t choose your time of death any more than your time of birth. We live and die when our time comes. Come on. 
###GLOUCESTER
And that’s true too. 
##They exit.
## EDMUND enters, victorious, with drums and banners. LEAR and CORDELIA enter as prisoners, led by the FIRST CAPTAIN and soldiers.
###EDMUND
Officers, take them away. Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them. 
###CORDELIA
(to LEAR) At least we’re not the first ones in our position. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. But I’m worried about you, my poor King. If it were only me, I would just wait out my bad luck. Should we meet with my sisters? 
###LEAR
No, no, no, no! Come on, let’s go to prison. The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage. We will be good to each other. When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me. That’s how we’ll live—we’ll pray, we’ll sing, we’ll tell old stories, we’ll laugh at pretentious courtiers, we’ll listen to nasty court gossip, we’ll find out who’s losing and who’s winning, who’s in and who’s out. We’ll think about the mysteries of the universe as if we were God’s spies. In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change. 
###EDMUND
Take them away. 
###LEAR
My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me. Have I hugged you yet? Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes. Wipe your eyes. 
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again. We’ll watch them starve to death first. Come on. 
## LEAR and CORDELIA exit, led by soldiers.
###EDMUND
Come here, captain. Listen. (gives the FIRST CAPTAIN a sheet of paper) Take this note. Follow those two to prison and follow these instructions. I’ve already promoted you once. If you do as you’re told, you’ll be richly rewarded. Just remember this: you have to go with the times, and these are the times for being tough. A soldier can’t afford to be a ninny. There’ll be no quibbling about this assignment. Either you accept it, or go find some other way to support yourself. 
###FIRST CAPTAIN
I’ll do it, sir. 
###EDMUND
Then off you go. When you’ve finished, you’ll be a happy man. Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down. 
###FIRST CAPTAIN
Jobs are hard to come by. I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse. If it’s work for a man, I’ll do it. 
##The FIRST CAPTAIN exits.
##Trumpets play. ALBANY enters with GONERIL and REGAN, a SECOND CAPTAIN, and more soldiers.
###ALBANY
(to EDMUND) Sir, you’ve shown your true courage today, and luck was on your side. You’ve taken prisoner the leaders of the opposition. I need to take cus- 
tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom. 
###EDMUND
Sir, I decided it was appropriate to send the pathetic old king to a guarded prison cell. His old age and his title make him so popular among the commoners that I was worried our enlisted soldiers would turn against us on his behalf. I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason. They’re ready to meet with you tomorrow, or whenever you like, wherever you’d like to hold your hearing. These are difficult times. Many have lost friends in battle, and soldiers will curse even a justified war if it causes them pain. We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father. 
###ALBANY
I’m sorry, sir, but in this war I consider you a subordinate, not my equal. 
###REGAN
That’s for to me to decide. You might have asked my opinion before saying something so rude. Edmund has led our forces well, and implemented my wishes—and his close connection with me gives him the right to be considered your equal. 
###GONERIL
Not so fast. He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him. 
###REGAN
I’m the one who gave him his military commission, and it is as my proxy that he fought bravely. 
###ALBANY
He’d really be your proxy if he married you. 
###REGAN
Don’t joke, it might come true. 
###GONERIL
Whoa, whoa! You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating. 
###REGAN
Hey, lady, if I weren’t feeling a little sick, I’d give you a piece of my mind. (to EDMUND) General, take my soldiers, my prisoners, my whole inheritance, and do as you like with them. I surrender myself to your good judgment. Let the whole world see that I hereby make you my lord and master. 
###GONERIL
Are you trying to sleep with him? 
###ALBANY
(to GONERIL) It’s not up to you to say “Yes” or “No.” 
###EDMUND
Nor is it up to you, my lord. 
###ALBANY
Yes it is, you half-blood. 
###REGAN
(to EDMUND) Let the drums beat. Prove your right to me by defeating any challenger. 
###ALBANY
Hang on a second. Listen to me.—Edmund, you’re under arrest for capital treason. Along with you, your co-conspirator, this snake of a woman. (points at GONERIL. Then, speaking to REGAN) My dear sister-in-law, I veto your marriage announcement for the benefit of my wife, who is already engaged to Edmund. So if you want to get married, you’ll have to woo me. My wife’s already spoken for. 
###GONERIL
What a farce! 
###ALBANY
You’ve got a sword, Gloucester. Blow the trumpets. If nobody else comes to challenge you and prove what an abominable traitor you have been, I’ll have to challenge you myself. (he throws down his glove) I’ll prove soon enough that you’re just as wicked as I say you are. 
###REGAN
Oh, I’m sick, sick! 
###GONERIL
(to herself) If she’s not ill, I’ll never trust drugs again. 
###EDMUND
(throwing down his glove) You’re on. Whoever calls me a traitor is a vicious liar. Blow the trumpet. Anyone who dares to step forward and make that accusation—you or anyone else—go ahead. I’ll uphold my truth and my honor. 
###ALBANY
A herald! Call a herald! 
###EDMUND
A herald, a herald! 
##A HERALD enters.
###ALBANY
(to EDMUND) You’re on your own now. The soldiers were all drafted in my name, and now they are discharged in my name. 
###REGAN
I feel sicker and sicker. 
###ALBANY
She’s not feeling well. Take her to my tent. 
## REGAN is helped to exit.
Come here, herald.—Let the trumpet sound!—Read this out. (he hands the HERALD a document) 
###SECOND CAPTAIN
Blow the trumpet! 
##A trumpet sounds.
###HERALD
(reads) “If any noble man in the army asserts that Edmund, so-called Earl of Gloucester, is a traitor many times over, let him step forward by the third trumpet blast.” 
###EDMUND
Sound! 
##First trumpet sounds.
###HERALD
Again! 
##Second trumpet sounds.
###HERALD
Again! 
##Third trumpet sounds. Another trumpet answers inside. EDGAR enters, wearing armor.
###ALBANY
(to HERALD) Ask him why he’s stepping forward. 
###HERALD
Who are you? What’s your name and rank, and why are you stepping forward? 
###EDGAR
I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor. But I’m as noble as my opponent. 
###ALBANY
And who is that? 
###EDGAR
Who’s the spokesman for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester? 
###EDMUND
I’m my own spokesman. What do you have to say to me? 
###EDGAR
Draw your sword. If I offend you by what I say, you can use your sword to take revenge. Here’s mine. (he draws his sword) Look at it. It’s the symbol of my honor, my rank, and my status as a knight. In spite of your youth, rank, strength, and excellence at warfare, in spite of your courage, your recent victory, and your good luck, I declare that you’re a traitor. You’ve betrayed your gods, your brother, and your father. You’ve plotted against this noble duke. You’re a rotten traitor, through and through, from the top of your head to the soles of your feet. If you disagree with me, I’m ready to use this sword and my courage to prove that you’re a liar. 
###EDMUND
Normally I would ask you what your name is first. But since you look so fine and noble, and since you’re so well mannered in your speech, I’m prepared to overlook the rules of knighthood, which say I should refuse to fight a man I don’t know. I throw your accusations back in your face. Your lies can hardly hurt me, but I’ll 
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow! 
##Trumpets play. EDMUND and EDGAR fight. EDMUND falls.
###ALBANY
(to EDGAR) Save him, save him! 
###GONERIL
You were tricked into fighting, Gloucester. According to the laws of war, you didn’t have to fight a stranger. You haven’t lost this fight; you’ve been tricked and deceived. 
###ALBANY
Shut your mouth, woman, or I’ll shove this paper in it.—Stop, sir. (gives the letter to EDMUND) You despicable criminal, read your crime. (to GONERIL) Don’t try to tear it up, madam. I take it you know what this letter says. 
###GONERIL
And what if I do? I make the laws, not you. Who can prosecute me for it? 
###ALBANY
Oh, monstrous! (to EDMUND) Do you know what letter this is? 
###EDMUND
Don’t ask me what I know. 
## GONERIL exits.
###ALBANY
Follow her. She’s desperate. Make sure she doesn’t do anything stupid. 
##A soldier exits.
###EDMUND
I’ve done everything you accuse me of—and more, much more. You’ll find out everything in due time. It’s all over now, and so am I. (to EDGAR) But who are you, you who’ve managed to defeat me? If you’re a nobleman, I forgive you. 
###EDGAR
Let’s forgive each other. I’m no less noble than you are, Edmund. If I’m more noble than you, you’ve done me wrong. My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son. The gods are fair, and they use our little vices to punish us. The woman he committed adultery with, your mother, cost him his eyes. 
###EDMUND
You’re right. That’s true. It’s all come full circle, and here I am. 
###ALBANY
I suspected that you were noble when I saw how you walked. Let me embrace you. I swear I never hated you or your father! 
###EDGAR
I know, prince. 
###ALBANY
Where have you been hiding? How did you know what happened to your poor father? 
###EDGAR
I knew because I helped nurse him through his suffering. Listen to my little story, and when it’s done, oh, my heart will break! To escape the decree condemning me 
to death, I disguised myself as a madman beggar and became a creature despised even by dogs.—Oh, how sweet our lives must be if we prefer to die gradually by debasing ourselves rather than dying all at once!—In that disguise I met up with my father with bloody sockets where his beautiful eyes used to be. I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide. I never—oh, what a mistake!—revealed myself to him until half an hour ago, when I was in my armor. With hope in my heart I asked him for his blessing, not sure that he’d give it to me. He did. I told him everything that had happened on my journey. But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out. 
###EDMUND
Your words have moved me, and maybe it’ll do some good. But go on. You look like you have something more to say. 
###ALBANY
If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add, keep it to yourself. I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much. 
###EDGAR
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness, but if I went on I could outdo it. While I was sobbing loudly, a man came in. He had seen me in my ragged clothes and shunned me, but when he found out who I was, he clasped my neck with his strong arms and cried to high heaven. He threw himself on my father and told the saddest story you’ve ever heard about Lear and him. As he was telling that story he grieved more and 
more, until his heart started to break. Then I heard the trumpets blow twice, and left him there in a trance. 
###ALBANY
But who was that man? 
###EDGAR
It was Kent, sir, the exiled Kent, who, after the king treated him like an enemy of the state, put on a disguise and followed his king, carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave. 
##The SECOND KNIGHT enters with a bloody knife.
###SECOND KNIGHT
Help, help, oh, help! 
###EDGAR
What kind of help do you need? 
###ALBANY
Say something, man! 
###EDGAR
What is that bloody knife? 
###SECOND KNIGHT
It’s still warm from the cut. It was just removed from from the heart of—oh, she’s dead! 
###ALBANY
Who’s dead? Speak, man. 
###SECOND KNIGHT
Your wife, sir, your wife. And her sister’s dead too, poisoned by your wife. She confessed. 
###EDMUND
I was engaged to both of them. All three of us will marry now in death. 
###EDGAR
Here comes Kent. 
###ALBANY
(to SECOND KNIGHT) Bring the bodies here, whether they’re alive or dead. We tremble at the gods' wrath, but we don’t mourn these deaths. 
##The SECOND KNIGHT exits.
## KENT enters.
Oh, is that Kent? There’s no time for polite greetings. 
###KENT
I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master. Isn’t he here? 
###ALBANY
What an enormous thing for us to forget!—Edmund, tell us, where’s the king? And where’s Cordelia?— 
## GONERIL’s and REGAN’s bodies are brought out.
Do you see this, Kent? 
###KENT
Oh, why is this so? 
###EDMUND
Still, Edmund was beloved. One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me, and then killed herself. 
###ALBANY
Apparently so.—Cover their faces. 
###EDMUND
I wish I could live longer. I want to do a little good despite my evil nature. Go quickly—hurry—to the castle, for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed. Hurry, send someone immediately! 
###ALBANY
Run, run, oh, run! 
###EDGAR
Whom should we look for in the castle?—Whose job is it? Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders. 
###EDMUND
Good idea. Take my sword. The captain—give it to the captain. 
###EDGAR
Run as if your life depended on it. 
##A soldier exits.
###EDMUND
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair. 
###ALBANY
Heaven help her!—Get him out of here for now. 
##Soldiers exit with EDMUND.
## LEAR enters with CORDELIA in his arms, followed by the THIRD KNIGHT.
###LEAR
Howl, howl, howl, howl! Oh, you men are made of stone! If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with, I’d crack heaven wide open with my laments! She’s gone forever. I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead. She’s as dead as the cold ground. Let me borrow a mirror. If her breath steams up the glass, then she’s alive. 
###KENT
Is this doomsday? The end of the world? 
###EDGAR
Or just a foretaste of it? 
###ALBANY
Let the world collapse around us. 
###LEAR
This feather moved because of her breath. She’s alive. If that’s true, it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known. 
###KENT
Oh, my good master! 
###LEAR
Please, go away. 
###EDGAR
It’s noble Kent, your friend. 
###LEAR
Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors! I could have saved her. Now she’s gone forever.—Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a while. Ha? What are you saying?—Her voice always was so soft and gentle. That’s a good thing in a woman.—I killed the scum who was hanging you. 
###THIRD KNIGHT
It’s true, my lords, he did. 
###LEAR
Didn’t I? Back in the old days I would’ve made him dance with my sword. But I’m old now, and suffering has weakened me. (to KENT) Who are you? My eyesight’s not the best, I’ll tell you straight. 
###KENT
We’re looking at the unluckiest man who ever lived. 
###LEAR
My vision is dull. Aren’t you Kent? 
###KENT
That’s me. Your servant Kent. Where’s your servant Caius? 
###LEAR
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that much. Not afraid to fight, he’s a feisty one. He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now. 
###KENT
No, my lord, that was me. I’m the one who— 
###LEAR
I’ll get right on that. 
###KENT
—followed you on your sad wanderings, ever since your bad luck began. 
###LEAR
Nice to see you. 
###KENT
It was me, no one else. Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful. Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair. 
###LEAR
Yes, I think that’s true. 
###ALBANY
He doesn’t know what he’s saying. It’s useless to try to talk to him. 
##The THIRD MESSENGER enters.
###EDGAR
Yes, it’s pointless. 
###THIRD MESSENGER
Edmund is dead, my lord. 
###ALBANY
That doesn’t matter much with everything else that’s going on.—Gentlemen, I will announce my plans. I’ll do everything I can to ease the king’s suffering. As for me, I’m surrendering all my power over to him, giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life. 
(to EDGAR and KENT) You will get back your rightful property and titles, along with new honors that you have more than deserved.—My friends and allies will be rewarded for their support, and my enemies will get what they deserve. Look, look! 
###LEAR
And my poor fool was hanged.— No, no, no life left? Why should a dog or horse or rat have life, but not you? You’ll never come to me again, never, never, never, never, never.—Please help me undo this button. Thank you, sir. Do you see that? Look at her. Look, her lips. Look there, look there. Oh, oh, oh, oh. (he dies) 
###EDGAR
He’s fainted.—My lord, my lord! 
###KENT
My heart will break, break. 
###EDGAR
(to LEAR) Look at me, my lord. 
###KENT
Don’t disturb his soul. Let it go up to heaven. His soul would be angry at anyone who tried to keep him in the torture chamber of this life any longer. 
###EDGAR
Oh, he’s really gone. 
###KENT
What’s amazing is how long he lasted. He was living on borrowed time at the end. 
###ALBANY
Carry them away. Our business now is mourning and grief. (to KENT and EDGAR) My friends and soulmates, you two will reign over this kingdom and keep the wounded country alive. 
###KENT
I will have to go on a journey to death soon, sir. My master’s calling me. I can’t say no. 
###EDGAR
We must remember the gravity of this sad day. We should speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest one suffered the most. We young ones will never see as much as he has seen, or live as long. 
##They exit in a funeral march.

## FLAVIUS and MURELLUS enter and speak to a CARPENTER, a COBBLER, and some other commoners.
###FLAVIUS
Get out of here! Go home, you lazy men. What, is today a holiday? Don’t you know that working men aren’t supposed to walk around on a workday without wearing their work clothes? You there, speak up. What’s your occupation? 
###CARPENTER
I’m a carpenter, sir. 
###MURELLUS
Where are your leather apron and your ruler? What are you doing, wearing your best clothes? And you, sir, what’s your trade? 
###COBBLER
Well, compared to a fine workman, you might call me a mere cobbler. 
###MURELLUS
But what’s your trade? Answer me straightforwardly. 
###COBBLER
It is a trade, sir, that I practice with a clear conscience. I am a mender of worn soles. 
###MURELLUS
What trade, boy? You insolent rascal, what trade? 
###COBBLER
Sir, please, don’t be angry. But if your soles are worn out, I can mend you. 
###MURELLUS
What do you mean by that? “Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?! 
###COBBLER
Cobble you, sir. 
###FLAVIUS
You’re a cobbler, are you? 
###COBBLER
Sir, I make my living using an awl. I stick to my work; I don’t meddle in politics or chase women. I’m a surgeon to old shoes. When they’re endangered, I save them. The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork. 
###FLAVIUS
But why aren’t you in your shop today? Why are you leading these men through the streets? 
###COBBLER
Well, to wear out their shoes and get myself more work. Seriously, though, we took the day off to see Caesar, sir, and celebrate his triumph. 
###MURELLUS
Why would you celebrate it? What victory does he bring home? What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels? You blockheads, you unfeeling men! You hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, didn’t you know Pompey? Many times you climbed up on walls and battlements, towers and windows—even chimney tops—with your babies in your arms, and sat there patiently all day waiting to see great Pompey ride through the streets of Rome. And when you caught a glimpse of his chariot, didn’t you shout so loud that the river Tiber shook as it echoed? And now you put on your best clothes? And now you take a holiday? 
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar, who comes in triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons? Go home! Run to your houses, fall on your knees, and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude. 
###FLAVIUS
Go, go, good countrymen, and to make up for having done wrong, gather up all the poor men like yourselves, lead them to the Tiber, and weep into the river until it overflows its banks. 
##The CARPENTER, COBBLER, and all the commoners exit.
Well, that ought to move even the most thickheaded of them. There they go, feeling so guilty they’re now tongue-tied—they don’t have a thing to say. You go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way. Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar. 
###MURELLUS
Can we do that? You know it’s the feast of Lupercal. 
###FLAVIUS
It doesn’t matter. Make sure that none of the statues are decorated in tribute to Caesar. I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets. You do the same, wherever the crowds are thick. If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience. 
##They exit in different directions.
##A trumpet sounds. CAESAR enters, followed by ANTONY, dressed formally for a foot race, then CALPHURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS, CICERO, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and CASCA. A great crowd follows, among them a SOOTHSAYERA soothsayer is a fortune-teller.SOOTHSAYER .
###CAESAR
Calphurnia! 
###CASCA
Quiet! Caesar’s talking. 
###CAESAR
Calphurnia! 
###CALPHURNIA
I’m here, my lord. 
###CAESAR
Stand right in Antonius’s path when he runs the race. Antonius! 
###ANTONY
Yes, Caesar? 
###CAESAR
Antonius, after you take off, don’t forget to touch Calphurnia, because our wise elders say that if you touch an infertile woman during this holy race, she’ll be freed from the curse of sterility. 
###ANTONY
I’ll remember. When Caesar says “do this,” it is done. 
###CAESAR
Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals. 
##A trumpet plays.
###SOOTHSAYER
Caesar! 
###CAESAR
Who’s calling me? 
###CASCA
Quiet, everyone! Quiet! 
##The trumpet stops playing.
###CAESAR
Who in the crowd is calling me? I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar!” Speak. Caesar is listening. 
###SOOTHSAYER
Beware of March 15th. 
###CAESAR
Who’s that? 
###BRUTUS
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th. 
###CAESAR
Bring him in front of me. Let me see his face. 
###CASSIUS
You, fellow, step out of the crowd. This is Caesar you’re looking at. 
##The SOOTHSAYER approaches.
###CAESAR
What do you have to say to me now? Speak once again. 
###SOOTHSAYER
Beware of March 15th. 
###CAESAR
He’s insane. Let’s leave him. Let’s move. 
##Trumpets play. Everyone exits except BRUTUS and CASSIUS.
###CASSIUS
Are you going to watch the race? 
###BRUTUS
Not me. 
###CASSIUS
Please, come. 
###BRUTUS
I don’t like sports. I’m not competitive like Antony. But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius. I’ll go my own way. 
###CASSIUS
Brutus, I’ve been watching you lately. You seem less good-natured and affectionate toward me than usual. You’ve been stubborn and unfamiliar with me, your friend who loves you. 
###BRUTUS
Cassius, don’t take it badly. If I seem guarded, it’s only because I’m uneasy with myself. Lately I’ve been overwhelmed with private thoughts and inner conflicts, which have affected my behavior. But this shouldn’t trouble my good friends—and I consider you a good friend, Cassius. Don’t think anything more about my distraction than that poor Brutus, who is at war with himself, forgets to show affection to others. 
###CASSIUS
Brutus, I misunderstood your feelings, and therefore kept to myself certain thoughts I might have shared. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? 
###BRUTUS
No, Cassius. The eye can’t see itself, except by reflection in other surfaces. 
###CASSIUS
That’s true. And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself. I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and wishing that your eyes were working better. 
###BRUTUS
What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there? 
###CASSIUS
I’ll tell you, good Brutus. And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see. And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus. If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous. 
##Trumpets play offstage, and then a shout is heard.
###BRUTUS
Why are they shouting? I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king. 
###CASSIUS
Really, are you afraid of that? Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king. 
###BRUTUS
I don’t, Cassius, though I love Caesar very much. But why do you keep me here so long? What do you want to tell me? If it’s for the good of all Romans, I’d do it even if it meant my death. Let the gods give me good luck only as long as I love honor more than I fear death. 
###CASSIUS
I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face. Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about. I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself. I was born as free as Caesar. So were you. We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he. Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow. And he did. The water roared, and we fought against it with vigorous arms. And, thanks to our fierce competitiveness, we made progress. But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar. 
And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way. In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake. It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook. His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam. I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl. It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone. 
##A shout offstage. Trumpets play.
###BRUTUS
More shouting! I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar. 
###CASSIUS
Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves. Men can be masters of their fate. It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves. “Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”? Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours? Write them together—yours is just as good a name. Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say. Weigh them—it’s just as heavy. 
Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great? Our era should be ashamed! Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men! When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man? Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome. Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man. You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule. 
###BRUTUS
I have no doubt that you love me. I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do. What I think about this, and about what’s happening here in Rome, I’ll tell you later. For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend. I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters. Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through. 
###CASSIUS
I’m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you. 
## CAESAR enters with his followers, who include CASCA.
###BRUTUS
The games are done and Caesar is returning. 
###CASSIUS
As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve, and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today—in his usual sour way. 
###BRUTUS
I’ll do so. But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded. Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol. 
###CASSIUS
Casca will tell us what’s the matter. 
##During the exchange between CAESAR and ANTONY, BRUTUS pulls CASCA by the sleeve.
###CAESAR
Antonio! 
###ANTONY
Caesar? 
###CAESAR
(speaking so that only ANTONY can hear) I want the men around me to be fat, healthy-looking men who sleep at night. That Cassius over there has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Men like him are dangerous. 
###ANTONY
(speaking so that only CAESAR can hear) Don’t be afraid of him, Caesar. He isn’t dangerous. He’s a noble Roman with a good disposition. 
###CAESAR
(speaking so that only ANTONY can hear) I wish he were fatter! But I’m not afraid of him. And yet, if I were capable of fearing anyone, Cassius would be the first man I’d avoid. He reads a lot, he’s a keen observer, and he sees the hidden motives in what men do. He doesn’t like plays the way you do, Antony. He doesn’t listen to music. He rarely smiles, and when he does smile, he does so in a self-mocking way, as if he scorns himself for smiling at all. Men like him will never be comfortable while someone ranks higher than themselves, and therefore they’re very dangerous. I’m telling you what should be feared, not what I fear—because after all, I am Caesar. Come over to my right side, because this ear is deaf, and tell me what you really think of Cassius. 
##Trumpets play. CAESAR exits with all his followers except CASCA.
###CASCA
(to BRUTUS) You tugged on my cloak. Do you want to speak with me? 
###BRUTUS
Yes, Casca. Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood. 
###CASCA
But you were with him, weren’t you? 
###BRUTUS
If I were, I wouldn’t need to ask you what happened. 
###CASCA
A crown was offered to him, and he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this—and then the people started shouting. 
###BRUTUS
What was the second noise for? 
###CASCA
The same thing. 
###CASSIUS
They shouted three times. What was the last cry for? 
###CASCA
For the same thing. 
###BRUTUS
The crown was offered to him three times? 
###CASCA
Yes, indeed, it was, and he pushed it away three times, each time more gently than the last; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted. 
###CASSIUS
Who offered him the crown? 
###CASCA
Antony. 
###BRUTUS
Tell us how it happened, noble Casca. 
###CASCA
I can’t explain it. It was all silly and so I paid no attention. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it. Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it). Then Antony offered it the third time. He refused it the third time, and as he refused it the commoners hooted and clapped their chapped hands, and threw up their sweaty hats, and let loose such a great deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it nearly choked Caesar, because he fainted and fell down. As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air. 
###CASSIUS
But wait a minute, please. Did you say Caesar fainted? 
###CASCA
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless. 
###BRUTUS
That’s very likely. He has epilepsy, a disease where you fall down. 
###CASSIUS
No, Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy. You and I, and honest Casca, we have epilepsy—we’ve fallen. 
###CASCA
I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down. The rabble applauded and hissed him according to whether he pleased them or displeased them, just like they do to actors in the theater. If they didn’t, I’m a liar. 
###BRUTUS
What did he say when he regained consciousness? 
###CASCA
Indeed, before he fell down, when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown, he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut. If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer, to hell with me. And so he fainted. When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness. Three or four women near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him. 
###BRUTUS
And after that he came back here looking so serious? 
###CASCA
Yes. 
###CASSIUS
Did Cicero say anything? 
###CASCA
Yes, he said something in Greek. 
###CASSIUS
What did he say? 
###CASCA
If I told you I understood Greek, I’d be lying. But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. As for myself, it was Greek to me. I have more news too. Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar. There you go. There was even more foolishness, if I could only remember it. 
###CASSIUS
Will you have dinner with me tonight, Casca? 
###CASCA
No, I have a commitment. 
###CASSIUS
Will you dine with me tomorrow? 
###CASCA
Yes, if I’m still alive, and you’re still sane, and your dinner is worth eating. 
###CASSIUS
Good. I’ll expect you. 
###CASCA
Do so. Farewell to you both. 
## CASCA exits.
###BRUTUS
What a stupid man he’s become! He was so sharp when he was in school. 
###CASSIUS
He’s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise, though he puts on this show of stupidity. He speaks roughly, but what he says is smart, and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him. 
###BRUTUS
You’re right, that’s how it is. I’ll leave you for now. If you’d like to talk tomorrow, I’ll come to your home. Or, if you don’t mind, come to my home, and I’ll wait for you. 
###CASSIUS
I’ll do so. Until then, think about the well-being of Rome. 
## BRUTUS exits.
Well, Brutus, you’re noble. Yet I see that your honorable character can be bent from its usual shape, which proves that good men should stick only to the company of other good men, because who is so firm that he can’t be seduced? Caesar resents me, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me, I wouldn’t have let him influence me. Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting—as if they came from several citizens—all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus, and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition. And after this, let Caesar brace himself, for we’ll either dethrone him or suffer even worse than now. 
## CASSIUS exits.
##Thunder and lightning. CASCA and CICERO enter.
###CICERO
Good evening, Casca. Did you accompany Caesar home? Why are you breathless, and why are you staring like that? 
###CASCA
Aren’t you disturbed when the earth itself is shaking and swaying as if it were a flimsy thing? Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire. Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction. 
###CICERO
What—have you seen something so strange that it is clearly an omen from the gods? 
###CASCA
A common slave—you’d know him if you saw him—held up his left hand, which flamed and burned like twenty torches together. And yet his hand was immune to the fire and didn’t get burned. Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me. And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets. 
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon. When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally. They’re natural enough.” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country. 
###CICERO
Indeed, it’s a strange time. But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves. Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow? 
###CASCA
He is, because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there tomorrow. 
###CICERO
Good night then, Casca. This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in. 
###CASCA
Farewell, Cicero 
## CICERO exits.
## CASSIUS enters.
###CASSIUS
Who’s there? 
###CASCA
A Roman. 
###CASSIUS
It’s Casca—I know your voice. 
###CASCA
Your ear is good. Cassius, what a night this is! 
###CASSIUS
It’s a very pleasing night to honest men. 
###CASCA
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this? 
###CASSIUS
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth. I have walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night, unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the thunderbolt. When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky, I put myself right where I thought it would hit. 
###CASCA
But why did you tempt the heavens like that? Mankind’s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals. 
###CASSIUS
You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them. You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens. But if you thought about the real reason for all these fires, all these gliding ghosts, for why birds and animals abandon their natural behavior, why old men, fools, and children make predictions, why all sorts of things have departed from the usual course of their natures and become monstrosities, then you’d understand that heaven had them act this way so they would serve as frightening warnings of an unnatural state to come. Right this minute, Casca, I could name a man who’s just like this dreadful night. A man who thunders, throws lightning, splits open graves, and roars like the lion in the Capitol. 
A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings. 
###CASCA
You’re talking about Caesar, right, Cassius? 
###CASSIUS
Let it be who it is. Romans today still have the powerful bodies of their ancestors, but, unfortunately, we don’t have their manly spirits, and instead we take after our mothers. Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak, like women. 
###CASCA
Indeed, they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow, and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy. 
###CASSIUS
I know where I’ll wear this dagger, then. I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery. In suicide, gods make the weak strong. In suicide, gods allow tyrants to be defeated. No stony tower, no brass walls, no airless dungeon, no iron chains can contain a strong mind. But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles, he can always kill himself. Let everyone beware: I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose. 
##Thunder continues.
###CASCA
So can I. In fact, every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself. 
###CASSIUS
How can Caesar be a tyrant then? Poor man! I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep. He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t such easy prey. People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs. Rome becomes complete trash, nothing but rubbish and garbage, when it works to light up the ambitions of someone as worthless as Caesar. But, oh no! What have I said in my grief? I might be speaking to someone who wants to be a slave, in which case I’ll be held accountable for my words. But I’m armed and I don’t care about danger. 
###CASCA
You’re talking to Casca, not to some smiling, two-faced tattletale. Say no more. Shake my hand. If you’re joining together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one of you. 
###CASSIUS
That’s a deal. Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission. And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater. We’re meeting on this fearful night because no one is out on the streets. The sky tonight looks bloody, fiery, and terrible, just like the work we have to do. 
## CINNA enters.
###CASCA
Hide for a minute—someone’s approaching fast. 
###CASSIUS
It’s Cinna. I recognize his walk. He’s a friend. Cinna, where are you going in such a hurry? 
###CINNA
To find you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber? 
###CASSIUS
No, it’s Casca, someone who’s going to work with us. Aren’t the others waiting for me, Cinna? 
###CINNA
I’m glad Casca is with us. What a fearful night this is! Two or three of us have seen strange things. 
###CASSIUS
Are the others waiting? Tell me. 
###CINNA
Yes, they are. Oh, Cassius, if you could only convince Brutus to join us— 
###CASSIUS
Don’t worry. Good Cinna, take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge’s chair where Brutus sits, so he’ll find it. And throw this one in his window, and attach this one with wax to the statue of Brutus’s ancestor, old Brutus. When you’ve finished all this, return to the porch of Pompey’s theater, where you’ll find us. Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there? 
###CINNA
Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone to look for you at your house. Well, I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me. 
###CASSIUS
When you’ve finished, go back to Pompey’s theater. 
## CINNA exits.
Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise. He’s three-quarters on our side already, and we’ll win him over entirely at this meeting. 
###CASCA
Oh, the people love him well. Things that would look bad if we did them, Brutus could do and look virtuous—just like an alchemist turns worthless tin to gold. 
###CASSIUS
Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him. Let’s go, because it’s already after midnight, and we want him on our side before daylight. 
##They exit.
## BRUTUS enters in his orchard.
###BRUTUS
Lucius, are you there? I can’t tell by the position of the stars how near it is to daybreak—Lucius, are you there? I wish I had that weakness, to sleep too soundly. Come on, Lucius! Wake up, I say! Lucius! 
## LUCIUS enters.
###LUCIUS
Did you call me, my lord? 
###BRUTUS
Put a candle in my study, Lucius. Call me when it’s lit. 
###LUCIUS
I will, my lord. 
## LUCIUS exits.
###BRUTUS
The only way is to kill Caesar. I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people. He wants to be crowned. The question is, how would being king change him? Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully. If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage. 
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion. To be honest, I’ve never known Caesar to let his emotions get the better of his reason. But everyone knows that an ambitious young man uses humility to advance himself, but when he reaches the top, he turns his back on his supporters and reaches for the skies while scorning those who helped him get where he is. Caesar might act like that. Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back. And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions. And therefore we should liken him to a serpent’s egg—once it has hatched, it becomes dangerous, like all serpents. Thus we must kill him while he’s still in the shell. 
## LUCIUS enters.
###LUCIUS
The candle is burning in your study, sir. While I was looking for a flint to light it, I found this paper on the window, sealed up like this, and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed. (he gives BRUTUS the letter) 
###BRUTUS
Go back to bed. It isn’t daybreak yet. Is tomorrow the 15th of March, boy? 
###LUCIUS
I don’t know, sir. 
###BRUTUS
Check the calendar and come tell me. 
###LUCIUS
I will, sir. 
## LUCIUS exits.
###BRUTUS
The meteors whizzing in the sky are so bright that I can read by them. (he opens the letter and reads) “Brutus, you’re sleeping. Wake up and look at yourself. Is Rome going to … etc. Speak, strike, fix the wrongs!” “Brutus, you’re sleeping. Wake up.” I’ve noticed many such calls to action left where I would find them. “Is Rome going to … etc.” What does this mean? Will Rome submit to one man’s power? My ancestors drove Tarquin from the streets of Rome when he was pronounced a king. “Speak, strike, fix it!” Is this asking me to speak and strike? Oh, Rome, I promise you, if you’re meant to receive justice, you’ll receive it by my hand! 
## LUCIUS enters.
###LUCIUS
Sir, fifteen days of March have gone by. 
##The sound of a knock offstage.
###BRUTUS
Good. Go to the gate. Somebody’s knocking. 
## LUCIUS exits.
I haven’t slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar. 
From the time when you decide to do something terrible to the moment you do it, everything feels unreal, like a horrible dream. The unconscious and the body work together and rebel against the conscious mind. 
## LUCIUS enters.
###LUCIUS
Sir, it’s your brother-in-law Cassius at the door. He wants to see you. 
###BRUTUS
Is he alone? 
###LUCIUS
No, sir. There are others with him. 
###BRUTUS
Do you know them? 
###LUCIUS
No, sir, their hats are pulled down over their ears and their faces are half buried under their cloaks, so there’s no way to tell who they are. 
###BRUTUS
Let them in. 
## LUCIUS exits.
It’s the faction that wants to kill Caesar. Oh, conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when evil things are most free? If so, when it’s day, where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face? No, don’t bother to find a cave, conspiracy. Instead, hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness. 
If you went ahead and exposed your true face, Hell itself wouldn’t be dark enough to keep you from being found and stopped. 
##The conspirators—CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS, CINNA, METELLUS, and TREBONIUS—enter.
###CASSIUS
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time. Good morning, Brutus. Are we bothering you? 
###BRUTUS
I was awake. I’ve been up all night. Do I know these men who are with you? 
###CASSIUS
Yes, every one of them. There isn’t one of them who doesn’t admire you, and each one of them wishes you had as high an opinion of yourself as every noble Roman has of you. This is Trebonius. 
###BRUTUS
He’s welcome here. 
###CASSIUS
This is Decius Brutus. 
###BRUTUS
He’s welcome too. 
###CASSIUS
This is Casca. This is Cinna. And this is Metellus Cimber. 
###BRUTUS
They’re all welcome. What worries have kept you awake tonight? 
###CASSIUS
Can I have a word with you? 
## BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper together.
###DECIUS
Here’s the east. Won’t the dawn come from here? 
###CASCA
No. 
###CINNA
Excuse me, sir, it will. These gray lines that lace the clouds are the beginnings of the dawn. 
###CASCA
You’re both wrong. (pointing his sword) Here, where I point my sword, the sun rises. It’s quite near the south, since it’s still winter. About two months from now, the dawn will break further toward the north, and due east is where the Capitol stands, here. 
###BRUTUS
(coming forward with CASSIUS) Give me your hands, all of you, one by one. (he shakes their hands) 
###CASSIUS
And let us swear to our resolution. 
###BRUTUS
No, let’s not swear an oath. If the sad faces of our fellow men, the suffering of our own souls, and the corruption of the present time aren’t enough to motivate us, let’s break it off now and each of us go back to bed. Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim. But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action? What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down? And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying? Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse. Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons. Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made. 
###CASSIUS
But what about Cicero? Should we see what he thinks? I think he will stand strong with us. 
###CASCA
Let’s not leave him out. 
###CINNA
No, by no means. 
###METELLUS
Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions. They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment, ordered the actions. His dignified maturity will distract attention from our youth and wildness. 
###BRUTUS
No, don’t even mention him. We shouldn’t tell him about our plans. He’ll never follow anything that other men have started. 
###CASSIUS
Then leave him out. 
###CASCA
Indeed, he’s not right for this. 
###DECIUS
But should we only go after Caesar? No one else? 
###CASSIUS
Good point, Decius. I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar. We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter. And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all. To prevent this, Mark Antony should die along with Caesar. 
###BRUTUS
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms. It’ll look like we killed Caesar out of anger and Mark Antony out of envy. Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius. We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that. Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself! But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him. Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger. Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs. Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do. This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful. If we appear calm to the people, they’ll call us surgeons rather than murderers. As for Mark Antony—forget him. He’ll be as useless as Caesar’s arm after Caesar’s head is cut off. 
###CASSIUS
But I’m still afraid of him, because the deep-rooted love he has for Caesar— 
###BRUTUS
Alas, good Cassius, don’t think about him. If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar. And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends. 
###TREBONIUS
There’s nothing to fear in him. Let’s not kill him. He’ll live and laugh at this afterward. 
##A clock strikes.
###BRUTUS
Quiet! Count how many times the clock chimes. 
###CASSIUS
The clock struck three. 
###TREBONIUS
It’s time to leave. 
###CASSIUS
But we still don’t know whether Caesar will go out in public today or not, because he’s become superstitious lately, a complete turnaround from when he used to have such a bad opinion of fortune-tellers, dream interpreters, and ritual mumbo-jumbo. It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today. 
###DECIUS
Don’t worry about that. If he’s reluctant, I can convince him. He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers, just like unicorns can be captured in trees, elephants in holes, and lions with nets. When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most. Let me work on him. I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol. 
###CASSIUS
No, we’ll all go there to bring him. 
###BRUTUS
By eight o'clock. Is that the latest we can do it? 
###CINNA
Let’s make that the latest, but be sure to get there before then. 
###METELLUS
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for speaking well of Pompey. I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support. 
###BRUTUS
Good Metellus, go to him now. He likes me, and I’ve given him good reason to. Just send him here, and I’ll persuade him. 
###CASSIUS
The morning is approaching. We’ll leave, Brutus. Friends, go your separate ways. But all of you, remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans. 
###BRUTUS
Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy. Don’t let our faces betray our plans. Instead, carry yourselves like Roman actors, with cheerful spirits and well-composed faces. And so, good morning to all of you. 
##Everyone except BRUTUS exits.
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? Well, enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep. Your brain isn’t stuffed with the strange shapes and fantasies that come to men who are overwhelmed by worries. That’s why you sleep so soundly. 
## PORTIA enters.
###PORTIA
Brutus, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
Portia, what are you doing awake? It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning. 
###PORTIA
It’s not good for your health, either. You rudely snuck out of bed. And last night at dinner, you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed, brooding and sighing, and when I asked you what was the matter, you gave me a dirty look. I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently. I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone. So I left, afraid of further provoking anger that was already inflamed but still hoping this was merely moodiness, which everyone is affected by once in awhile. Your strange mood won’t let you eat or talk or sleep. If it had changed your outward appearance as much as it has affected you on the inside, I wouldn’t even be able to recognize you, Brutus. My dear lord, tell me what’s bothering you. 
###BRUTUS
I’m not feeling well—that’s all. 
###PORTIA
You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better. 
###BRUTUS
I’m doing so. Good Portia, go to bed. 
###PORTIA
Are you sick? And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning? You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker? No, my Brutus, you have some sickness within your mind, which by virtue of my position I deserve to know about. (she kneels) And on my knees, I urge you, by my once-praised beauty, by all your vows of love and that great vow of marriage which made the two of us one person, that you should reveal to me, who is one half of yourself, why you’re troubled and what men have visited you tonight. For there were six or seven men here, who hid their faces even in the darkness. 
###BRUTUS
Don’t kneel, noble Portia. 
###PORTIA
(getting up) I wouldn’t need to if you were acting nobly. Tell me, Brutus, as your wife, aren’t I supposed to be told the secrets that concern you? Am I part of you only in a limited sense—I get to have dinner with you, sleep with you, and talk to you sometimes? 
Is my place only on the outskirts of your happiness? If it’s nothing more than that, then I’m your whore, not your wife. 
###BRUTUS
You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart. 
###PORTIA
If that were true, then I’d know your secret. I admit I’m only a woman, but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife. I admit I’m only a woman, but I’m still a woman from a noble family—I’m Cato’s daughter. Do you really think I’m no stronger than the rest of my sex, with such a father and such a husband? Tell me your secrets. I won’t betray them. I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh. If I can bear that pain, then I can bear my husband’s secrets. 
###BRUTUS
Oh, gods, make me worthy of this noble wife! 
##A knocking sound offstage.
Listen! Someone knocks. Portia, go inside awhile, and soon enough you’ll share the secrets of my heart. I’ll explain all that I have committed to do and all the reasons for my sad face. Leave me quickly. 
## PORTIA exits.
Lucius, who’s that knocking? 
## LUCIUS and LIGARIUS enter. Ligarius wears a cloth wrapped around his head, indicating that he’s sick.
###LUCIUS
Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you. 
###BRUTUS
It’s Caius Ligarius, whom Metellus spoke of. Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! How are you? 
###LIGARIUS
Please accept my feeble “good morning.” 
###BRUTUS
Oh, what a time you’ve chosen to be sick, brave Caius! How I wish you felt better! 
###LIGARIUS
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me. 
###BRUTUS
Indeed, I would have such an exploit for you, Ligarius, if you were healthy enough to hear it. 
###LIGARIUS
(takes off his head covering) By all the gods that Romans worship, I hereby throw off my sickness! Soul of Rome! Brave son of honorable ancestors! You’ve conjured up my deadened spirit like an exorcist. Now say the word, and I will tackle all kinds of impossible things, and succeed too. What is there to do? 
###BRUTUS
A deed that will make sick men healthy. 
###LIGARIUS
But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick? 
###BRUTUS
That too. My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to. 
###LIGARIUS
Start walking, and with an energized heart, I’ll follow you—to what, I don’t know, but I’m satisfied, simply knowing that Brutus leads me. 
##Thunder.
###BRUTUS
Follow me, then. 
##They all exit.
##Thunder and lightning. CAESAR enters in his nightgown.
###CAESAR
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight. Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep, “Help, someone! They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s there? 
##A SERVANT enters.
###SERVANT
My lord? 
###CAESAR
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring me their interpretation of the results. 
###SERVANT
I will, my lord. 
##The SERVANT exits.
## CALPHURNIA enters.
###CALPHURNIA
What are you doing, Caesar? Are you planning to go out? You’re not leaving the house today. 
###CAESAR
I will go out. The things that threaten me have only seen my back. When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish. 
###CALPHURNIA
Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me. A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw. A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead. 
Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol. The noise of battle filled the air, and horses neighed, and dying men groaned, and ghosts shrieked and squealed in the streets. Oh, Caesar! These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid. 
###CAESAR
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen? But I will go out, for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me. 
###CALPHURNIA
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky. The heavens only announce the deaths of princes. 
###CAESAR
Cowards die many times before their deaths. The brave experience death only once. Of all the strange things I’ve ever heard, it seems most strange to me that men fear death, given that death, which can’t be avoided, will come whenever it wants. 
##The SERVANT enters.
What do the priests say? 
###SERVANT
They don’t want you to go out today. They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart. 
###CAESAR
The gods do this to test my bravery. They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear. So, I won’t. 
Danger knows that Caesar is more dangerous than he is. We’re two lions born on the same day in the same litter, and I’m the older and more terrible. I will go out. 
###CALPHURNIA
Alas, my lord, your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom. Don’t go out today. Say that it’s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own. We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, and he’ll say that you’re sick today. (she kneels) Let me, on my knees, win you over to this plan. 
###CAESAR
All right. Mark Antony will say I’m not well, and to please you I’ll stay at home. 
## CALPHURNIA gets up.
## DECIUS enters.
Here’s Decius Brutus. He’ll tell them so. 
###DECIUS
Hail, Caesar! Good morning, worthy Caesar. I’ve come to take you to the senate house. 
###CAESAR
And you’ve come at a good time, so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won’t come today. It wouldn’t be true to say that I can’t come, and even less true to say that I don’t dare come. I simply won’t come today. Tell them so, Decius. 
###CALPHURNIA
Say he’s sick. 
###CAESAR
Would I send a lie? Have I accomplished so much in battle, but now I’m afraid to tell some old men the truth? 
Decius, go tell them that Caesar won’t come. 
###DECIUS
Most mighty Caesar, give me some reason, so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so. 
###CAESAR
The reason is that it’s what I want. I’m not coming. That’s enough for the senate. But for your private satisfaction, because I love you, I’ll tell you. Calphurnia, my wife, is keeping me at home. Last night, she dreamed she saw a statue of me with a hundred holes in it, like a fountain with pure blood flowing from it, and many happy Romans came smiling and washed their hands in it. She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come, and, on her knee, she begged me to stay home today. 
###DECIUS
This dream has been interpreted all wrong. It was a good and lucky vision. Your statue spouting blood through many holes, in which many smiling Romans bathed, means that you’ll provide great Rome with sustaining blood, and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood. This is what Calphurnia’s dream means. 
###CAESAR
You’ve offered an excellent interpretation. 
###DECIUS
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say. The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today. 
If you send them word that you won’t come, they might change their minds. Besides, someone’s likely to joke, “Adjourn the senate until some other time, when Caesar’s wife has had better dreams.” If you hide yourself, won’t they whisper, “Caesar is afraid?” Pardon me, Caesar. My high hopes for your advancement force me to tell you this. My love gets the better of my manners. 
###CAESAR
How foolish your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I’m ashamed that I yielded to them. Give me my robe, because I’m going. 
## PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA enter.
And look, here’s Publius, come to fetch me. 
###PUBLIUS
Good morning, Caesar. 
###CAESAR
Welcome, Publius. What, Brutus? Are you up this early too? Good morning, Casca. Caius Ligarius, I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that’s made you so thin. What time is it? 
###BRUTUS
Caesar, the clock has struck eight. 
###CAESAR
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy. 
## ANTONY enters.
See! Even Antony, who stays up all night partying, is awake. Good morning, Antony. 
###ANTONY
And to you, most noble Caesar. 
###CAESAR
Tell them to prepare the other room for guests. I’m to blame for making you wait for me. Now, Cinna. Now, Metellus. Trebonius! I have an hour-long matter to discuss with you. Remember to see me today. Stay near me so I’ll remember. 
###TREBONIUS
Caesar, I will. (speaking quietly to himself) In fact, I’ll be so near that your best friends will wish I’d been further away. 
###CAESAR
Good friends, go in and have some wine with me. And we’ll leave together, like friends. 
###BRUTUS
(quietly to himself) That we are now only “like” friends—Oh Caesar—makes my heart ache. 
##They all exit.
## ARTEMIDORUS enters, reading a letter.
###ARTEMIDORUS
(reading aloud from the letter) “Caesar, beware of Brutus. Watch Cassius. Don’t go near Casca. Keep an eye on Cinna. Don’t trust Trebonius. Pay attention to Metellus Cimber. Decius Brutus doesn’t love you. You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius. These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar. If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you. A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy. I pray that the mighty gods defend you!      Your friend,      Artemidorus.” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition. My heart regrets that good men aren’t safe from the bite of jealous rivals. If you read this, Caesar, you might live. If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors. 
##He exits.
## PORTIA and LUCIUS enter.
###PORTIA
Boy, I beg you to run to the senate house. Don’t stay to answer me—get going. Why are you still standing there? 
###LUCIUS
To find out what you want me to do there, madam. 
###PORTIA
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there. (to herself, so that no one can hear her) Oh, let my determination keep me from speaking what is in my heart! I have a man’s mind, but only a woman’s strength. How hard it is for women to keep secrets! (to LUCIUS) Are you still here? 
###LUCIUS
Madam, what should I do? Run to the Capitol and nothing else? And then return to you and nothing else? 
###PORTIA
Yes, return and tell me if your master looks well, because he was sick when he left. And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him. Listen, boy! What’s that noise? 
###LUCIUS
I don’t hear anything, madam. 
###PORTIA
I beg you, listen well. I heard a noise like a scuffle. The wind brings it from the Capitol. 
###LUCIUS
Truly, madam, I don’t hear anything. 
##The SOOTHSAYER enters.
###PORTIA
Come here, you. Where are you coming from? 
###SOOTHSAYER
My own house, good lady. 
###PORTIA
What time is it? 
###SOOTHSAYER
Around nine o'clock, madam. 
###PORTIA
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet? 
###SOOTHSAYER
Madam, not yet. I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol. 
###PORTIA
You have some plea for Caesar, don’t you? 
###SOOTHSAYER
Yes, I do, lady. If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me, I’ll try to get him to do what’s good for him. 
###PORTIA
Why, do you know of any harm intended toward him? 
###SOOTHSAYER
Nothing that I know for sure, but a lot that I’m afraid might happen. Good morning to you. The street is narrow here. The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels—senators, justices, common petitioners—will suffocate a feeble man almost to death. I’ll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past. 
##He exits.
###PORTIA
I must go in. (speaking quietly to herself) Oh, a woman’s heart is so weak! Oh Brutus, may the gods aid you in your endeavor! Surely, the boy heard me. (to LUCIUS) Brutus has a claim that Caesar won’t grant. Oh, I feel faint. Run, Lucius, and speak well of me to my lord. Say that I’m happy. Then return to me and tell me what he says to you. 
##They exit in opposite directions.
##A crowd of people enters, among them ARTEMIDORUS and the SOOTHSAYER. A trumpet plays. CAESAR, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS, METELLUS, TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILLIUS, PUBLIUS, and others enter.
###CAESAR
(to the SOOTHSAYER) March 15th has come. 
###SOOTHSAYER
Yes, Caesar, but it’s not gone yet. 
###ARTEMIDORUS
(offering his letter) Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule. 
###DECIUS
(offering CAESAR another paper) Trebonius wants you to look over his humble petition, at your leisure. 
###ARTEMIDORUS
Oh, Caesar, read mine first, for my petition affects you more directly. Read it, great Caesar. 
###CAESAR
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last. 
###ARTEMIDORUS
Don’t delay, Caesar. Read it instantly. 
###CAESAR
What, is the man insane? 
###PUBLIUS
(to ARTEMIDORUS) Stand aside, you. 
###CASSIUS
(to ARTEMIDORUS) What? Are you pressing your petition on the street? Go to the Capitol. 
## CAESAR goes up to the senate house, the rest following.
###POPILLIUS
(to CASSIUS) I hope your endeavor goes well today. 
###CASSIUS
What endeavor, Popillius? 
###POPILLIUS
Good luck. 
## POPILLIUS approaches CAESAR.
###BRUTUS
(to CASSIUS) What did Popillius Lena say? 
###CASSIUS
(speaking so that only BRUTUS can hear) He wished that our endeavor would go well today. I’m afraid we’ve been found out. 
###BRUTUS
Look, he’s approaching Caesar. Keep an eye on him. 
###CASSIUS
Casca, be quick, because we’re worried we might be stopped. Brutus, what will we do? If our secret’s known, either Caesar or I will die, for I’ll kill myself. 
###BRUTUS
Cassius, stand firm. Popillius Lena wasn’t talking about our plot—for, look, he’s smiling, and Caesar’s expression is the same. 
###CASSIUS
Trebonius knows his cue. See, Brutus, he’s pulling Mark Antony aside. 
## TREBONIUS and ANTONY exit.
###DECIUS
Where’s Metellus Cimber? He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now. 
###BRUTUS
They’re speaking to him. Go up there and second his petition. 
###CINNA
Casca, you’ll be the first to raise your hand. 
###CAESAR
Are we all ready? What problem should I discuss with you first? 
###METELLUS
(kneeling) Most high, most mighty, and most powerful Caesar, Metellus Cimber kneels before you with a humble heart— 
###CAESAR
I have to stop you, Cimber. These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men, flattering them into turning Roman law into children’s games. But don’t be so foolish as to think you can sway me from what’s right by using the tactics that persuade fools—I mean this flattery, low bows, and puppy-like fawning. Your brother has been banished by decree. If you kneel and beg and flatter for him, I’ll kick you out of my way like I would a dog. Know that I am not unjust, and I will not grant him a pardon without reason. 
###METELLUS
Is there no voice worthier than my own to appeal to Caesar to repeal the order that my brother be banished? 
###BRUTUS
(kneeling) I kiss your hand, but not in flattery, Caesar. I ask you to repeal Publius Cimber’s banishment immediately. 
###CAESAR
What, even you, Brutus? 
###CASSIUS
(kneeling) Pardon him, Caesar, pardon him. I fall to your feet to beg you to restore Publius Cimber to citizenship. 
###CAESAR
I could be convinced if I were like you. If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too. But I’m as immovable as the northern star, whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky. The sky shows countless stars. They’re all made of fire, and each one shines. But only one among all of them remains in a fixed position. So it is on earth. The world is full of men, and men are flesh and blood, and they are capable of reason. Yet out of all of them, I know only one who is unassailable, who never moves from his position. To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case. I was firm in ordering that Cimber be banished, and I remain firm in that decision. 
###CINNA
(kneeling) Oh, Caesar— 
###CAESAR
Enough! Would you try to lift Mount Olympus? 
###DECIUS
(kneeling) Great Caesar— 
###CAESAR
Haven’t I resisted even Brutus, begging from his knees? 
###CASCA
Hands, speak for me! 
## CASCA and the other conspirators stab CAESAR. BRUTUS stabs him last.
###CAESAR
And you too, Brutus? In that case, die, Caesar. (he dies) 
###CINNA
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run and proclaim it in the streets. 
###CASSIUS
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and democracy!” 
##Confusion. Some citizens and senators exit.
###BRUTUS
People and senators, don’t be afraid. Don’t run away—stay where you are. Only Caesar had to die for his ambition. 
###CASCA
Go to the platform, Brutus. 
###DECIUS
And Cassius too. 
###BRUTUS
Where’s Publius? 
###CINNA
Here. He’s completely stunned by this mutiny. 
###METELLUS
Stand close together, in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to— 
###BRUTUS
Don’t talk about standing together.—Publius, cheer up. We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone else. Tell them this, Publius. 
###CASSIUS
And leave us, Publius, in case the people storming us should harm you. 
###BRUTUS
Do so. And let no one suffer for this deed except us, the perpetrators. 
## PUBLIUS exits.
## TREBONIUS enters.
###CASSIUS
Where’s Antony? 
###TREBONIUS
He ran to his house, stunned. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run in the streets as though it were doomsday. 
###BRUTUS
We’ll soon find out what fate has in store for us. All we know is that we’ll die sometime, which is all anyone ever knows, though we try to draw out our days for as long as possible. 
###CASSIUS
Why, the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death. 
###BRUTUS
So, then, death is a gift, and we are Caesar’s friends, for we’ve done him a service by shortening his time spent fearing death. Kneel, Romans, kneel, and let’s wash our hands, up to the elbows, in Caesar’s blood and smear it on our swords. Then we’ll go out, even to the marketplace, and, waving our bloody swords over our heads, let’s cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” 
###CASSIUS
Kneel then, and wash. 
##The conspirators smear their hands and swords with CAESAR’s blood.
How many years from now will this heroic scene be reenacted in countries that don’t even exist yet and in languages not yet known! 
###BRUTUS
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show, though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue, as worthless as dust! 
###CASSIUS
As often as it’s replayed, our group will be hailed as the men who gave their country liberty. 
###DECIUS
Well, should we go out? 
###CASSIUS
Yes, every man forward. Brutus will lead, and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome. 
## ANTONY'S SERVANT enters.
###BRUTUS
Wait a minute. Who’s that coming? It’s a friend of Antony’s. 
###ANTONY'S SERVANT
(kneeling) Brutus, my master ordered me to kneel like this. (he kneels, head bowed low) He ordered me to kneel low, and, from the ground, like this, he ordered me to say: “Brutus is noble, wise, brave, and honest. Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Antony loves Brutus and honors him. Antony feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. 
If Brutus will swear that Antony may come to him safely and be convinced that Caesar deserved to be killed, Mark Antony will love dead Caesar not nearly as much as living Brutus, and with true faith he’ll follow the destiny and affairs of noble Brutus through the difficulties of this unprecedented state of affairs.” That’s what my master, Antony, says. 
###BRUTUS
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman. I never thought any less of him. Tell him, if he comes here, I’ll explain everything to him and, on my word, he’ll leave unharmed. 
###ANTONY'S SERVANT
(getting up) I’ll get him now. 
## ANTONY'S SERVANT exits.
###BRUTUS
I know that he’ll be on our side. 
###CASSIUS
I hope we can count on him, but I still fear him, and my hunches are usually accurate. 
## ANTONY enters.
###BRUTUS
But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony. 
###ANTONY
Oh, mighty Caesar! Do you lie so low? Have all your conquests, glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little? Farewell. Gentlemen, I don’t know what you intend to do, who else you intend to kill, who else you consider corrupt. 
If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world. I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood. I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now. There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era. 
###BRUTUS
Oh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you. Though we seem bloody and cruel right now, with our bloody hands and this deed we’ve done, you’ve only seen our hands and their bloody business; you haven’t looked into our hearts. They are full of pity for Caesar. But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him. For you, our swords have blunt edges, too dull to harm you, Mark Antony. Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. 
###CASSIUS
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government. 
###BRUTUS
But just be patient until we’ve calmed the masses, who are beside themselves with fear. Then we’ll explain to you why I, who loved Caesar even while I stabbed him, have taken this course of action. 
###ANTONY
I don’t doubt your wisdom. Each of you, give me your bloody hand. (he shakes hands with the conspirators) First, Marcus Brutus, I shake your hand. Next, Caius Cassius, I take your hand. Now, Decius Brutus, yours. Now yours, Metellus. Yours, Cinna. And yours, my brave Casca. Last but not least, yours, good Trebonius. You are all gentlemen—alas, what can I say? Now that I’ve shaken your hands, you’ll take me for either a coward or a flatterer—in either case, my credibility stands on slippery ground. It’s true that I loved you, Caesar—nothing could be truer. If your spirit is looking down upon us now, it must hurt you more than even your death to see your Antony making peace—shaking the bloody hands of your enemies—in front of your corpse. If I had as many eyes as you have wounds, and they wept as fast as your wounds stream blood—even that would be more becoming than joining your enemies in friendship. Forgive me, Julius! On this very spot you were hunted down, like a brave deer. And here you fell, where your hunters are now standing. The spot is marked by your death and stained by your blood. Oh world, you were the forest to this deer, and this deer, oh world, was your dear. Now you lie here, stabbed by many princes! 
###CASSIUS
Mark Antony— 
###ANTONY
Pardon me, Caius Cassius. Even Caesar’s enemies would say the same. From a friend, it’s a cool assessment—no more than that. 
###CASSIUS
I don’t blame you for praising Caesar like this, but what agreement do you intend to reach with us? Will you be counted as our friend, or should we proceed without depending on you? 
###ANTONY
I took your hands in friendship, but, indeed, I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar. I am friends with you all and love you all, on one condition—that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous. 
###BRUTUS
Without that proof, this would’ve been a savage action! Our reasons are so well considered that even if you, Antony, were Caesar’s son, you would be satisfied with them. 
###ANTONY
That’s all I ask—and that you let me carry his body to the marketplace and, as a friend ought to do, stand on the platform and give a proper funeral oration. 
###BRUTUS
You may, Mark Antony. 
###CASSIUS
Brutus, may I have a word with you? (speaking so that only BRUTUS can hear) You don’t know what you’re doing. Don’t let Antony speak at his funeral. Don’t you know how much the people could be affected by what he says? 
###BRUTUS
(speaking so that only CASSIUS can hear) With your permission, I’ll stand on the platform first and explain the reason for Caesar’s death. 
What Antony says, I’ll announce, he says only by our permission and by our conviction that Caesar should be honored with all the usual and lawful ceremonies. It’ll help us more than hurt us. 
###CASSIUS
(speaking so that only BRUTUS can hear) I’m worried about the outcome of his speech. I don’t like this plan. 
###BRUTUS
Mark Antony, take Caesar’s body. You will not blame us in your funeral speech, but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission. Otherwise, you’ll have no role at all in his funeral. And you’ll speak on the same platform as I do, after I’m done. 
###ANTONY
So be it. I don’t want anything more. 
###BRUTUS
Prepare the body, then, and follow us. 
##Everyone except ANTONY exits.
###ANTONY
Oh, pardon me, you bleeding corpse, for speaking politely and acting mildly with these butchers! You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived. Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood. Over your wounds—which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips, as though to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men. 
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy. Blood and destruction will be so common and familiar that mothers will merely smile when their infants are cut to pieces by the hands of war. People’s capacity for sympathy will grow tired and weak from the sheer quantity of cruel deeds. And Caesar’s ghost, searching for revenge with the goddess Ate by his side, just up from Hell, will cry in the voice of a king, “Havoc!” and unleash the dogs of war. This foul deed will stink up to the sky with men’s corpses, which will beg to be buried. 
## OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT enters.
You serve Octavius Caesar, right? 
###OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT
I do, Mark Antony. 
###ANTONY
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome. 
###OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT
He received Caesar’s letters, and he is coming. He told me to say to you—(seeing CAESAR's body) Oh, Caesar!— 
###ANTONY
Your heart is big; go ahead and weep. Grief seems to be contagious, for my eyes, seeing the tears in yours, began to fill. Is your master coming? 
###OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome. 
###ANTONY
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened. This is now a Rome in mourning, a dangerous Rome. It’s not safe enough for Octavius yet. Hurry away and tell him so. No, wait, stay a minute. Don’t go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace. There I’ll use my speech to test what the people think of these bloody men’s cruel action. You’ll report back to young Octavius how they respond. Help me here. 
##They exit with CAESAR’s body.
## BRUTUS and CASSIUS enter with a throng of PLEBEIANSPlebeians = the common people of RomePLEBEIANS .
###PLEBEIANS
We want answers. Give us answers. 
###BRUTUS
Then follow me and listen to my speech, friends. Cassius, go to the next street and divide the crowd. Let those who will hear me speak stay. Lead those away who will follow you, and we’ll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar’s death. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
I’ll listen to Brutus. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
I’ll listen to Cassius, and we will compare their reasons. 
## CASSIUS exits with some of the PLEBEIANS. BRUTUS gets up on the platform.
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Quiet! Noble Brutus has mounted the platform. 
###BRUTUS
Be patient until I finish. Romans, countrymen, and friends! Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear. Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind, so you may believe me. Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly. If there’s anyone in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his. If, then, that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar, this is my answer: it’s not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. 
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves, or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men? I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me. I rejoice in his good fortune. I honor him for being brave. But his ambition—for that, I killed him. There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his bravery, and death for his ambition. Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave? If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended. Who here is so barbarous that he doesn’t want to be a Roman? If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended. Who here is so vile that he doesn’t love his country? If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I have offended. I will pause for a reply. 
###ALL
No one, Brutus, no one. 
###BRUTUS
Then I have offended no one. I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me. The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol. His glory has not been diminished where he earned it, nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated. 
## ANTONY enters with CAESAR’s body.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no part in the killing, will benefit from his death—receiving a share in the commonwealth, as you all will. With these words I leave. Just as I killed my best friend for the good of Rome, so will I kill myself when my country requires my death. 
###ALL
Live, Brutus! Live, live! 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Let’s carry him in triumph to his house! 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Let’s build a statue of him, near those of his ancestors! 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Let him become Caesar! 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration! 
###BRUTUS
My countrymen— 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Silence! Brutus speaks. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Quiet there! 
###BRUTUS
Good countrymen, let me leave alone. I want you to stay here with Antony to pay respects to Caesar’s corpse and listen to Antony’s speech about Caesar’s glories, which he gives with our permission. I ask that none of you leave, except myself, until Antony has finished. 
## BRUTUS exits.
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Let’s stay and hear Mark Antony. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Let him mount the pulpit. We’ll listen to him. Noble Antony, mount the podium. 
###ANTONY
For Brutus’s sake, I am indebted to you. (he steps up into the pulpit) 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
What does he say about Brutus? 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
He says that for Brutus’s sake he finds himself indebted to us all. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
He’d better not speak badly of Brutus here. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Caesar was a tyrant. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
That’s for sure. We’re lucky that Rome is rid of him. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Quiet! Let’s hear what Antony has to say. 
###ANTONY
You gentle Romans— 
###ALL
Quiet there! Let us hear him. 
###ANTONY
Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention. I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them. It might as well be the same with Caesar. The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious. If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it. With the permission of Brutus and the others—for Brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, he was faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city. 
Is this the work of an ambitious man? When the poor cried, Caesar cried too. Ambition shouldn’t be so soft. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious. And, no question, Brutus is an honorable man. I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what I know. You all loved him once, and not without reason. Then what reason holds you back from mourning him now? Men have become brutish beasts and lost their reason! Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause until it returns to me. (he weeps) 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
I think there’s a lot of sense in what he says. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
If you think about it correctly, Caesar has suffered a great wrong. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Has he, sirs? I’m worried there will be someone worse to replace him. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Did you hear Antony? Caesar wouldn’t take the crown. Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
If it turns out he wasn’t, certain people are going to get it. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Poor man! Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
There isn’t a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Now listen, he’s going to speak again. 
###ANTONY
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now he lies there worth nothing, and no one is so humble as to show him respect. Oh, sirs, if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I would offend Brutus and Cassius, who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I would rather wrong the dead, and wrong myself and you, than wrong such honorable men. But here’s a paper with Caesar’s seal on it. I found it in his room—it’s his will. If you could only hear this testament—which, excuse me, I don’t intend to read aloud—you would kiss dead Caesar’s wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood, and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by. And when you died, you would mention the handkerchief or the hair in your will, bequeathing it to your heirs like a rich legacy. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
We want to hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. 
###ALL
The will, the will! We want to hear Caesar’s will. 
###ANTONY
Be patient, gentle friends, I must not read it. It isn’t proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you. You aren’t wood, you aren’t stones—you’re men. And, being men, the contents of Caesar’s will would enrage you. It’s better that you don’t know you’re his heirs, for if you knew, just imagine what would come of it! 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Read the will. We want to hear it, Antony. You have to read us the will, Caesar’s will. 
###ANTONY
Will you be patient? Will you wait awhile? I’ve said too much in telling you of it. I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
They were traitors. “Honorable men!” 
###ALL
The will! The testament! 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will! 
###ANTONY
You force me to read the will, then? Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse, and let me show you the man who made this will. Shall I come down? Will you let me? 
###ALL
Come down. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Descend. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
We’ll let you. 
## ANTONY descends from the pulpit.
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Make a circle; stand around him. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Stand away from the hearse. Stand away from the body. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Make room for Antony, most noble Antony! 
###ANTONY
No, don’t press up against me. Stand further away. 
###ALL
Stand back. Give him room. 
###ANTONY
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all know this cloak. I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on. It was a summer’s evening; he was in his tent. It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors. Look, here’s where Cassius’s dagger pierced it. See the wound that Casca made. Through this hole beloved Brutus stabbed. And when he pulled out his cursed dagger, see how Caesar’s blood came with it, as if rushing out a door to see if it was really Brutus who was knocking so rudely. For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkind cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, he understood his beloved Brutus’s ingratitude; it was stronger than the violence of traitors, and it defeated him, bursting his mighty heart. And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell. Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen! Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed. Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity. These are gracious tears. But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now? Look at this, here is the man—scarred, as you can see, by traitors. (he lifts up CAESAR's cloak) 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Oh, what a sad sight! 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Oh, noble Caesar! 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Oh, sad day! 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Oh, traitors, villains! 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Oh, most bloody sight! 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
We will get revenge. 
###ALL
Revenge! Let’s go after them! Seek! Burn! Set fire! Kill! Slay! Leave no traitors alive! 
###ANTONY
Wait, countrymen. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Quiet there! Listen to the noble Antony. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
We’ll listen to him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. 
###ANTONY
Good friends, sweet friends, don’t let me stir you up to such a sudden mutiny. Those who have done this deed are honorable. I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it. They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it. I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends. I’m no orator, as Brutus is. I’m only, as you know, a plain, blunt man who loved his friend, and the men who let me speak know this well. I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up. I just speak directly. I tell you what you already know. I show you sweet Caesar’s wounds—poor, speechless mouths!—and make them speak for me. But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny. 
###ALL
We’ll mutiny. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
We’ll burn Brutus’s house. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Let’s go, then! Come, find the conspirators! 
###ANTONY
Wait, and listen to me, countrymen. 
###ALL
Quiet! Wait! Listen to Antony. Most noble Antony! 
###ANTONY
Why, friends, you don’t even know what you’re doing yet. What has Caesar done to deserve your love? Alas, you don’t know. I must tell you then. You’ve forgotten the will I told you about. 
###ALL
Yes! The will! Let’s stay and hear the will! 
###ANTONY
Here’s the will, written under Caesar’s seal. To every Roman citizen he gives—to every individual man—seventy-five drachmas. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Oh, royal Caesar! 
###ANTONY
Listen to me patiently. 
###ALL
Quiet, there! 
###ANTONY
Also, he’s left you all his walkways—in his private gardens and newly planted orchards—on this side of the Tiber River. He’s left them to you and to your heirs forever—public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax. Here was a Caesar! When will there be another like him? 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Never, never. Let’s go! We’ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors' houses on fire. Take up the body. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
We’ll start a fire. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
We’ll use benches for wood— 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
And windowsills, anything. 
##Citizens exit with CAESAR’s body.
###ANTONY
Now, let it work. Trouble, you have begun—take whatever course you choose! 
## OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT enters.
What’s up, my man? 
###OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT
Sir, Octavius has already arrived in Rome. 
###ANTONY
Where is he? 
###OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. 
###ANTONY
I will go straight to visit him. I ask for him, and he comes. Fortune is happy today and, in this mood, will give us anything we want. 
###OCTAVIUS'S SERVANT
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome. 
###ANTONY
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people. Take me to Octavius. 
##They exit.
## CINNA THE POET enters, followed by PLEBEIANS.
###CINNA THE POET
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination. I have no desire to go outside, yet something leads me there. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
What’s your name? 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Where are you going? 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Where do you live? 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Are you a married man or a bachelor? 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
Answer all of us, now. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Yes, and be brief. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Yes, and be wise. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Yes, and be truthful, if you know what’s good for you. 
###CINNA THE POET
What’s my name? Where am I going? Where do I live? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man briefly, wisely, and truthfully—wisely I say, I am a bachelor. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
You imply that married men are fools. You’ll get a blow from me for that, I think. Go on with what you were saying—right this instant. 
###CINNA THE POET
Right this instant, I’m going to Caesar’s funeral. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
As a friend or an enemy? 
###CINNA THE POET
As a friend. 
###SECOND PLEBEIAN
He answered that question straight. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
As for where you live, tell us quickly—get to the point. 
###CINNA THE POET
Getting right to the point, I live near the Capitol. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Tell us your name, sir, truthfully. 
###CINNA THE POET
Truthfully, my name is Cinna. 
###FIRST PLEBEIAN
Tear him to pieces. He’s a conspirator. 
###CINNA THE POET
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet! 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Tear him apart for his bad verses, tear him up! 
###CINNA THE POET
I’m not Cinna the conspirator. 
###FOURTH PLEBEIAN
It doesn’t matter. His name’s Cinna. Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go. 
###THIRD PLEBEIAN
Tear him apart, tear him up! 
##The PLEBEIANS attack CINNA THE POET.
###ALL
Come, firebrands, over here! To Brutus’s, to Cassius’s, let’s burn them all. Some of you go to Decius’s house and some to Casca’s. Some to Ligarius’s. Go! 
##The PLEBEIANS exit, dragging CINNA THE POET.
## ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS enter.
###ANTONY
These ones, then, will be assassinated. Their names are marked. 
###OCTAVIUS
(to LEPIDUS) Your brother has to die too. Do you agree, Lepidus? 
###LEPIDUS
I agree— 
###OCTAVIUS
Put a mark next to his name too, Antony. 
###LEPIDUS
On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony. 
###ANTONY
He will die. See—I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name. But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s house. Bring his will here, and we’ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people. 
###LEPIDUS
Will you be here when I return? 
###OCTAVIUS
Either here or at the Capitol. 
## LEPIDUS exits.
###ANTONY
He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands. Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers? 
###OCTAVIUS
You thought it made sense, and you listened to him about who should be marked to die in these harsh death sentences. 
###ANTONY
Octavius, I’m older than you are. And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him. Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures. 
###OCTAVIUS
You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier. 
###ANTONY
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants. But my horse is a creature that I teach to fight—to turn, to stop, to run in a straight line. I govern the motion of his body. And in some ways, Lepidus is just like that. He has to be taught and trained and told to go forward. He’s an empty man, who pays attention to fashions and tastes that other men took up and got tired of long ago. Don’t think about Lepidus except as a means to an end. And now, Octavius, listen to more important things. Brutus and Cassius are raising armies. We have to raise our own immediately. So, we should combine forces and organize our allies, pull together our friends, and stretch our resources as far as they’ll go. 
Let’s immediately organize a council to discuss the best way to find out their secrets and the safest way to confront the threats we’re already faced with. 
###OCTAVIUS
Let’s do that, because we’re hemmed in by many enemies. And even some of the people who smile at us are in fact plotting against us, I’m afraid. 
##They exit.
##A drum plays. BRUTUS, LUCILLIUS, LUCIUS, and SOLDIERS enter. TITINIUS and PINDARUS meet them.
###BRUTUS
Stop. 
###LUCILLIUS
Pass on the command to halt! 
###BRUTUS
What’s happening now, Lucillius? Is Cassius nearby? 
###LUCILLIUS
He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master. 
###BRUTUS
He sends his greetings through a good man. Your master, Pindarus, either because he’s changed his mind or been influenced by bad officers, has made me wish we hadn’t done some of the things we did. If he’s nearby, I want an explanation. 
###PINDARUS
I have no doubt that my noble master will prove himself to be what he is: honorable and noble. 
###BRUTUS
I don’t doubt him. Can I have a word with you, Lucillius? (takes LUCILLIUS aside) Tell me how Cassius treated you. Put my mind at rest. 
###LUCILLIUS
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me. 
###BRUTUS
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off. Remember this, Lucillius. When a friend starts to get sick of you, he treats you artificially. Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony. But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit. 
##A low sound of drums and SOLDIERS marching.
But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl. Is his army approaching? 
###LUCILLIUS
They plan to spend the night in Sardis. The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius. 
###BRUTUS
Look! He’s arrived. March to meet him at a dignified pace. 
## CASSIUS enters with his army.
###CASSIUS
Halt. 
###BRUTUS
Halt! Pass the order along. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Halt! 
###SECOND SOLDIER
Halt! 
###THIRD SOLDIER
Halt! 
###CASSIUS
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong. 
###BRUTUS
Let the gods judge me! Do I mistreat even my enemies? No. So how could I possibly wrong a brother? 
###CASSIUS
Brutus, your sober expression is a mask to hide the fact that you’ve wronged me. And when you do— 
###BRUTUS
Cassius, calm down. We know each other well, and you can speak your grievances quietly. Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us. Order them to move back. Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen. 
###CASSIUS
Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground. 
###BRUTUS
Lucillius, you do the same, and don’t allow anyone to come into our tent until we’ve finished our conference. Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door. 
##Everyone except BRUTUS and CASSIUS exits.
## BRUTUS and CASSIUS remain onstage. They are now in their tent.
###CASSIUS
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man. 
###BRUTUS
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man. 
###CASSIUS
In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense. 
###BRUTUS
I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold. 
###CASSIUS
Me, “greedy”! You know, if you were anyone other than Brutus, that speech would be your last. 
###BRUTUS
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished. 
###CASSIUS
Unpunished! 
###BRUTUS
Remember March, March 15th. Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice? 
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice? What—did one of us strike down the most powerful man in the world in order to support robbers? Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on? I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman. 
###CASSIUS
Brutus, do not provoke me. I will not take it. You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner. I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders. 
###BRUTUS
Get lost! You are not, Cassius. 
###CASSIUS
I am. 
###BRUTUS
I say you’re not. 
###CASSIUS
Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself. If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further. 
###BRUTUS
Leave, you little man. 
###CASSIUS
Is this possible? 
###BRUTUS
Listen to me, for I have something to tell you. Am I required to indulge your rash anger? Does a madman scare me when he stares at me? 
###CASSIUS
Oh gods, oh gods! Must I endure all this? 
###BRUTUS
“All this”? Yes, and more. Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks. Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble. But me—am I going to cower at you and your irritable moods? You’ll have to swallow your own poison till it makes you burst before I’m going to respond; from now on, I’ll make you the butt of my jokes whenever you get sharp with me. 
###CASSIUS
Has it come to this? 
###BRUTUS
You say you’re a better soldier. Show it! Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled. I’m always happy to hear about brave men. 
###CASSIUS
You wrong me in every way. You wrong me, Brutus. I said an older soldier, not a better one. Did I say “better”? 
###BRUTUS
If you did, I don’t care. 
###CASSIUS
When Caesar was alive, even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this. 
###BRUTUS
Oh, be quiet. You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so. 
###CASSIUS
I wouldn’t have dared! 
###BRUTUS
No. 
###CASSIUS
What? Not dared to tempt him? 
###BRUTUS
You wouldn’t have dared, out of fear for your life. 
###CASSIUS
Don’t take my love for granted. I might do something I’ll be sorry for. 
###BRUTUS
You’ve already done something you should be sorry for. Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze. I asked you for a certain amount of gold, which you wouldn’t give me. I myself can’t raise money by unethical means. I’d rather turn my heart into money and my drops of blood into coins than use crooked tactics to wring petty cash from the hardworking hands of peasants. I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me. Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew? And would I have ever done that to you? If I ever get so greedy that I hoard such petty cash from my friends, may the gods dash me to pieces with their thunderbolts! 
###CASSIUS
I didn’t refuse you. 
###BRUTUS
You did. 
###CASSIUS
I didn’t. The man who brought my answer to you was a fool. You have broken my heart. A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses, but you exaggerate mine. 
###BRUTUS
I don’t until you practice them on me. 
###CASSIUS
You don’t love me. 
###BRUTUS
I don’t like your faults. 
###CASSIUS
A friend would never see those faults. 
###BRUTUS
No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus. 
###CASSIUS
Come, Antony and young Octavius! Get your revenge on Cassius, because Cassius has grown tired of the world. He’s hated by someone he loves, defied by his brother, rebuked like a servant, all his faults observed, catalogued in a notebook, read, and committed to memory so they can be thrown in his face. Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself! There’s my dagger (he offers BRUTUS his unsheathed dagger), and here’s my bare chest. Inside it is a heart more valuable than Pluto’s silver mine and richer than gold. If you’re a Roman, take my heart out. I, who denied you gold, will give you my heart. Strike as you did at Caesar, for I know even when you hated him the most, you still loved him better than you ever loved me. 
###BRUTUS
Put away your dagger. Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me. Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood. Oh, Cassius, you’re partners with a quiet lamb. My anger is like a flint striking—a brief spark, and then I’m cold again. 
###CASSIUS
Have I lived this long only to be the butt of a joke whenever you’re angry or frustrated? 
###BRUTUS
When I said that, I was angry too. 
###CASSIUS
You admit it, then? Give me your hand. 
###BRUTUS
And my heart too. 
## CASSIUS and BRUTUS shake hands.
###CASSIUS
Oh, Brutus! 
###BRUTUS
What’s the matter? 
###CASSIUS
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave? 
###BRUTUS
Yes, Cassius. And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that. 
###POET
(offstage) Let me in to see the generals. There’s a grudge between them, and it isn’t a good idea for them to be alone. 
###LUCILLIUS
(offstage) You can’t see them. 
###POET
(offstage) You’d have to kill me to stop me. 
##A POET enters, followed by LUCILLIUS and TITINIUS.
###CASSIUS
What’s this! What’s the matter? 
###POET
You should be ashamed, generals! What do you think you’re doing? Love each other and be friends, like two such men should be. Listen to me, because I’m older than you, surely. 
###CASSIUS
Ha ha! This man’s rhymes are terrible! 
###BRUTUS
(to POET) Get out of here, you! Get away, you rude fellow! 
###CASSIUS
Be patient with him, Brutus. That’s just how he is. 
###BRUTUS
I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave. What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post? Get out of here, my friend. 
###CASSIUS
Away, away, be gone. 
##The POET exits.
###BRUTUS
Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night. 
###CASSIUS
And return to us immediately, bringing Messala with you. 
## LUCILLIUS and TITINIUS exit.
###BRUTUS
(calling offstage) Lucius, bring a bowl of wine. 
###CASSIUS
I didn’t think you could even be so angry. 
###BRUTUS
Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows. 
###CASSIUS
You’re forgetting your Stoic philosophy if you allow chance misfortunes to upset you. 
###BRUTUS
No one bears sorrow better than me. Portia is dead. 
###CASSIUS
Portia! 
###BRUTUS
She is dead. 
###CASSIUS
How did you manage not to kill me when we argued just now? What an irreplaceable and grievous loss! What sickness did she die of? 
###BRUTUS
She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death. She became full of despair and, when her attendants were away, swallowed burning coals. 
###CASSIUS
And that’s how she died? 
###BRUTUS
Yes, like that. 
###CASSIUS
Oh, immortal gods! 
## LUCIUS enters with wine and candles.
###BRUTUS
Don’t talk about her anymore. Give me a bowl of wine. With this toast I bury all bad feelings between us, Cassius. (he drinks) 
###CASSIUS
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise. Fill my cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows it. I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love. (he drinks) 
## LUCIUS exits.
## TITINIUS and MESSALA enter.
###BRUTUS
Come in, Titinius! Welcome, good Messala. Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs. 
###CASSIUS
Portia, are you really gone? 
###BRUTUS
No more about that, please. Messala, I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power. 
###MESSALA
I have received letters that say the same. 
###BRUTUS
And anything else? 
###MESSALA
That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death. 
###BRUTUS
On that point, our letters don’t agree. My letters say only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero. 
###CASSIUS
Cicero too? 
###MESSALA
Cicero is dead, by their decree. (to BRUTUS) Have you received letters from your wife, my lord? 
###BRUTUS
No, Messala. 
###MESSALA
And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters? 
###BRUTUS
Nothing, Messala. 
###MESSALA
I think that’s strange. 
###BRUTUS
Why do you ask? Have you heard something of her in your letters? 
###MESSALA
No, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth. 
###MESSALA
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman. It’s certain that she is dead, and she died in a strange way. 
###BRUTUS
Well, good-bye, Portia. We all must die, Messala. Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can endure her death now. 
###MESSALA
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses. 
###CASSIUS
I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do. 
###BRUTUS
Well, let’s move on to our work with the living. What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately? 
###CASSIUS
I don’t think it’s a good idea. 
###BRUTUS
Why not? 
###CASSIUS
Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us. That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble. 
###BRUTUS
Your reasons are good, but I have better reasons for doing the opposite. The people who live between here and Philippi are loyal to us only because we force them to be. We made them contribute to our efforts against their will. The enemy, marching past them, will add them to its numbers, then come at us refreshed, newly reinforced, and full of courage. Thus we must cut him off from this advantage. If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs. 
###CASSIUS
Listen to me, good brother. 
###BRUTUS
Begging your pardon, I’ll continue what I was saying. You must also take into account that we’ve gotten as much from our friends as they can give. Our regiments are full to the brim; our cause is ready. The enemy gets larger each day. We, now at our largest, can only decrease. There’s a tidal movement in men’s affairs. Seizing the highest tide leads on to fortune. If high tide is let to pass, all the rest of the voyage of their lives will be marked by difficulty and misery. It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating, and we must take the current when it is offered, or lose our campaign. 
###CASSIUS
If that’s what you want, all right. We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi. 
###BRUTUS
It’s now late at night, and actions must accommodate bodily needs, which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest. That’s all there is to say. 
###CASSIUS
There’s nothing else. Good night. We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow. 
###BRUTUS
Lucius! 
## LUCIUS enters.
My nightgown. 
## LUCIUS exits.
Farewell, good Messala. Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius, good night and sleep well. 
###CASSIUS
Oh my dear brother! This was a bad start to the night. Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again. Let’s not, Brutus. 
## LUCIUS enters with the nightgown.
###BRUTUS
Everything’s fine. 
###CASSIUS
Good night, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
Good night, good brother. 
###TITINIUS, MESSALA
Good night, Lord Brutus. 
###BRUTUS
Farewell, everyone. 
## CASSIUS, TITINIUS, and MESSALA exit.
Give me the gown. Where’s your lute? 
###LUCIUS
Here in the tent. 
###BRUTUS
What, are you sleepy? Poor boy, I don’t blame you; you’ve stayed awake too long. Call Claudio and some of my other men. I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent. 
###LUCIUS
Varrus and Claudio! 
## VARRUS and CLAUDIO enter.
###VARRUS
Did you call, my lord? 
###BRUTUS
Sirs, I ask you to sleep in my tent. I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius. 
###VARRUS
If you like, we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need. 
###BRUTUS
No, please, lie down, good sirs, because I might change my mind. Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for. I put it in the pocket of my nightgown. 
## VARRUS and CLAUDIO lie down.
###LUCIUS
I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me. 
###BRUTUS
Bear with me, good boy. I’ve become very forgetful. Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute? 
###LUCIUS
Yes, my lord, if you would like. 
###BRUTUS
I would, my boy. I ask too much of you, but you’re always willing. 
###LUCIUS
It’s my duty, sir. 
###BRUTUS
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able. I know that young men look forward to their rest. 
###LUCIUS
I’ve already slept, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
That was good planning, and you’ll sleep some more. I won’t keep you very long. If I live through this, I’ll be good to you. 
## LUCIUS plays music and sings a song, then falls asleep.
This is a sleepy tune. Oh, deadening sleep, have you taken over my boy who plays music for you? Gentle boy, good night. I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you. If you were to droop down, you’d break your instrument, and so I’ll take it from you. Good night, good boy. Let me see, let me see. Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading? Here it is, I think. This candle doesn’t give much light. 
##The GHOST of Caesar enters.
What! Who goes there? I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision. It’s coming toward me. Are you real? Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up? Tell me what you are. 
###GHOST
I’m your evil spirit, Brutus. 
###BRUTUS
Why do you come here? 
###GHOST
To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi. 
###BRUTUS
Then I’ll see you again? 
###GHOST
Yes, at Philippi. 
###BRUTUS
Alright, then I’ll see you at Philippi. 
##The GHOST exits.
Just as you go, I find the courage to talk to you. Evil spirit, I want to talk some more. Boy, Lucius! Varrus! Claudio! Sirs, awake! Claudio! 
###LUCIUS
My lord, the strings are out of tune. 
###BRUTUS
He thinks he’s still playing his instrument. Lucius, wake up! 
###LUCIUS
My lord? 
###BRUTUS
Were you dreaming, Lucius? Is that why you cried out? 
###LUCIUS
My lord, I don’t think I cried out. 
###BRUTUS
Yes, you did. Did you see anything? 
###LUCIUS
Nothing, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
Go back to sleep, Lucius. Claudio! (to VARRUS) You there, wake up! 
###VARRUS
My lord? 
###CLAUDIO
My lord? 
###BRUTUS
Why did you cry out in your sleep? 
###VARRUS, CLAUDIO
Did we, my lord? 
###BRUTUS
Yes. Did you see anything? 
###VARRUS
No, my lord, I didn’t see anything. 
###CLAUDIO
Me neither, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
Go to my brother Cassius. Order him to advance his forces first thing, and we’ll follow. 
###VARRUS, CLAUDIO
Yes, my lord. 
##Everyone exits in different directions.
## OCTAVIUS and ANTONY enter with their army.
###OCTAVIUS
Now, Antony, our prayers have been answered. You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions. It seems not. Their forces are nearby. They intend to challenge us here at Philippi, responding to our challenge before we’ve even challenged him. 
###ANTONY
I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing this. They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave. But they aren’t. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Prepare yourselves, generals. The enemy approaches with great display. They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something must be done immediately. 
###ANTONY
Octavius, lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field. 
###OCTAVIUS
I’ll go to the right side. You stay on the left. 
###ANTONY
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter? 
###OCTAVIUS
I’m not defying you, but it’s what I’m going to do. 
##The sound of soldiers marching, and a drum. BRUTUS and CASSIUS enter with their army, which includes LUCILLIUS, TITINIUS, and MESSALA.
###BRUTUS
They’ve stopped. They want to talk. 
###CASSIUS
Stay here, Titinius. We have to go out and talk to them. 
###OCTAVIUS
Mark Antony, should we give the signal to attack? 
###ANTONY
No, Octavius Caesar, we’ll respond to their charge. Go forward. The generals want to speak with us. 
###OCTAVIUS
(to his army) Don’t move until we give the signal. 
###BRUTUS
Words before fighting. Is that how it is, countrymen? 
###OCTAVIUS
Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do. 
###BRUTUS
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. 
###ANTONY
Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes. Think of the hole you made in Caesar’s heart when you cried, “Long live Caesar! Hail Caesar!” 
###CASSIUS
Antony, we don’t yet know what kind of blows you can inflict. But your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing. 
###ANTONY
I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say? 
###BRUTUS
Oh, yes, and you’ve left them silent too, because you stole their buzzing, Antony. You very wisely warn us before you sting. 
###ANTONY
Villains, you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides. You smiled like apes and fawned like dogs and bowed like servants, kissing Caesar’s feet. And all the while, damned Casca, like a dog, struck Caesar on the neck from behind. Oh, you flatterers! 
###CASSIUS
Flatterers! Now, Brutus, you have only yourself to thank. Antony wouldn’t be here to offend us today if you’d listened to me earlier. 
###OCTAVIUS
Come, come, let’s remember why we’re here. If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood. (he draws his sword) Look: I draw my sword against conspirators. When do you think I’ll put it away? Never, until Caesar’s thirty-three wounds are well avenged, or until I too have been killed by you. 
###BRUTUS
Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself.. 
###OCTAVIUS
I hope you’re right. I wasn’t born to die on your sword. 
###BRUTUS
If you were the noblest of your family, young man, you couldn’t die more honorably. 
###CASSIUS
An annoying schoolboy, unworthy of such an honor, joined by a masquerader and a partier! 
###ANTONY
Still the same old Cassius! 
###OCTAVIUS
Come Antony, let’s go. Traitors, we defy you. If you dare to fight today, come to the field. If not, come when you have the courage. 
## OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army exit.
###CASSIUS
Now let the wind blow, waves swell, and ships sink! The storm has begun and everything is at stake. 
###BRUTUS
Lucillius! I’d like a word with you. 
###LUCILLIUS
(coming forward) My lord? 
## BRUTUS and LUCILLIUS converse to the side.
###CASSIUS
Messala! 
###MESSALA
(coming forward) What is it, my general? 
###CASSIUS
Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day. Give me your hand, Messala. You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle. 
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens. I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens. Traveling from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there, eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi. This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey. Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die. 
###MESSALA
Don’t believe in this. 
###CASSIUS
I only partly believe it, for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering. 
###BRUTUS
(returning with LUCILLIUS) —Right, Lucillius. 
###CASSIUS
Now, most noble Brutus, the gods are friendly with us today so that we, who want peace, can live on to old age! But since the affairs of men are always uncertain, let’s think about the worst that may happen. If we lose this battle, this is the last time we’ll speak to each other. If we lose, what do you plan to do? 
###BRUTUS
By the same principle that made me condemn Cato for committing suicide, I plan to be patient and submit to what the gods decide. I don’t know why, but I find it cowardly and vile to kill oneself early to prevent possible suffering later on. 
###CASSIUS
Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome? 
###BRUTUS
No, Cassius, no. Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains. My mind is too great for that. But today, the work that March 15th began must end, and I don’t know if we’ll meet again. Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell. Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius! If we meet again, then we’ll smile. If not, then this parting was well done. 
###CASSIUS
Forever and forever, farewell, Brutus! If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed. If not, it’s true, this parting was well done. 
###BRUTUS
Well, lead on. Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens! But it’s enough to know that the day will end, and then the end will be known. Come! Let’s go! 
##They all exit.
##Sounds of battle. BRUTUS and MESSALA enter.
###BRUTUS
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side. 
##Faint sounds of battle.
They should advance immediately, because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now, and a sudden push would overthrow him. Ride, ride, Messala. Let Cassius’s wing mount a surprise attack. 
##They exit in opposite directions.
##Sounds of battle. CASSIUS and TITINIUS enter.
###CASSIUS
Oh, look, Titinius, look! Those villains, our soldiers, flee! I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers! This standard-bearer here of mine was running away, so I killed him and took the flag from him. (points to his flag) 
###TITINIUS
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon. Having an advantage over Octavius, he took it too eagerly, and his soldiers began looting, and now we’re surrounded by Antony’s men. 
## PINDARUS enters.
###PINDARUS
Retreat further, my lord, retreat further. Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord. Therefore you must run, noble Cassius. 
###CASSIUS
This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius. Are those my tents on fire? 
###TITINIUS
They are, my lord. 
###CASSIUS
Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies. 
###TITINIUS
I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought. 
##He exits.
###CASSIUS
Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill. My eyesight has always been bad. Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field. 
## PINDARUS ascends the hill.
Today was the day I breathed my first breath. Time has come round, and I’ll end where I began. My life has run its circle. (to PINDARUS) What can you see, boy? 
###PINDARUS
(above) Oh, my lord! 
###CASSIUS
What news? 
###PINDARUS
(above) Titinius is surrounded by horsemen who are quickly approaching him, yet he spurs onward. Now they’re almost on him. Now, Titinius! Now some dismount. Oh, he gets down too. He’s taken. 
##A shout offstage.
And listen! They shout for joy. 
###CASSIUS
Come down, look no more. Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes! 
## PINDARUS returns.
Come here, boy. I took you prisoner in Parthia, and at that time I made you swear to try to do whatever I ordered you to, except take your own life. Come now, keep your oath. (gives his sword to PINDARUS) Now you’ll be a free man. Take this good sword, which ran through Caesar’s bowels, and plunge it in my chest. Don’t hesitate. Here, take the handle, and when my face is covered as it is now, use the sword. 
## PINDARUS stabs CASSIUS.
Caesar, you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you. (he dies) 
###PINDARUS
So I’m free. But I didn’t want to be free like this. Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me. 
##He exits.
## TITINIUS and MESSALA enter.
###MESSALA
The armies have merely changed places, Titinius, because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’s forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’s legions. 
###TITINIUS
This news will comfort Cassius. 
###MESSALA
Where did you leave him? 
###TITINIUS
On this hill and in despair, with his slave Pindarus. 
###MESSALA
Isn’t that him on the ground? 
###TITINIUS
He doesn’t seem to be alive. Oh, my heart! 
###MESSALA
Isn’t that him? 
###TITINIUS
No, it was him, Messala, but Cassius is no more. Just as the sun’s rays turn red when it sets, so Cassius has ended his life in a pool of red blood. The sun of Rome has set! Our day is over. Clouds, dew, and dangers approach. We’re finished! He didn’t believe I would ever return on my mission, and so he killed himself. 
###MESSALA
Yes, he killed himself because he thought we’d lost the whole battle. Sadness, which misconstrues reality, gave birth to his errors in thinking—and then destroyed him. 
###TITINIUS
Pindarus! Where are you, Pindarus? 
###MESSALA
Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news. I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this. 
###TITINIUS
Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime. 
## MESSALA exits.
Why did you send me out, brave Cassius? Didn’t I meet up with your allies? And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you? Didn’t you hear their shouts? Alas, you misunderstood everything! But let me place this wreath on your head. Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says. (he lays a wreath on CASSIUS’s head) Brutus, come this way and see how much I admired Caius Cassius. With your permission, gods, this is a Roman’s duty. Come, Cassius’s sword, and strike Titinius’s heart. (he stabs himself with CASSIUS’s sword and dies.) 
##Sounds of battle. BRUTUS, MESSALA, young CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, LUCILLIUS, LABIO, and FLAVIO enter.
###BRUTUS
Where is his body, Messala? 
###MESSALA
Over there, where Titinius mourns it. 
###BRUTUS
Titinius is lying face-up. 
###CATO
He’s been killed. 
###BRUTUS
Oh, Julius Caesar, you are still powerful. Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs. 
##Faint sounds of battle.
###CATO
Brave Titinius! Look, he even put the crown on dead Cassius! 
###BRUTUS
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two? Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans. Rome will never produce your equal. Friends, I owe more tears to this dead man than you will see me shed. I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time. Come, then, and send his body to Thasos. We won’t have his funeral at our camp, because it might make us too sad to fight. Lucillius, come. And come, young Cato. Let’s proceed to the field. Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward. It is three o'clock, and, Romans, before night, we will try our luck in a second battle. 
##They all exit.
##Sounds of battle. BRUTUS,MESSALA, CATO, LUCILLIUS, and FLAVIO enter.
###BRUTUS
Keep on, countrymen. Oh, keep your heads up, even now! 
## BRUTUS, MESSALA, and FLAVIO exit.
###CATO
Who is so low that he wouldn’t? Who will advance with me? I will proclaim my name around the field. I am the son of Marcus Cato! An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country. I am the son of Marcus Cato! 
## ANTONY and OCTAVIUS' SOLDIERS enter and fight.
###LUCILLIUS
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus. Brutus, my country’s friend. Know that I am Brutus! 
## SOLDIERS kill young CATO.
Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain? Why, you die now as bravely as Titinius. And you, being Cato’s son, will be honored. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
(to LUCILLIUS ) Surrender or you will die. 
###LUCILLIUS
I’d rather die. Here is some money for you to kill me immediately. Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
We must not. He is a noble prisoner! 
## ANTONY enters.
###SECOND SOLDIER
Make room! Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
I’ll tell him the news. Oh, here comes the general—Brutus has been caught, Brutus is taken, my lord. 
###ANTONY
Where is he? 
###LUCILLIUS
He’s safe, Antony. I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive. The gods protect him from so great a shame! When you do find him, alive or dead, he’ll be found on his own terms. 
###ANTONY
(to SOLDIERS) This isn’t Brutus, friend, but, I assure you, he is a valuable prize. Keep this man safe. Be kind to him. I would rather have such men as friends than enemies. Move on, find out if Brutus is alive or dead, then return to Octavius’s tent to tell us what you’ve learned. 
##They exit in opposite directions.
## BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS enter.
###BRUTUS
Come, last of my friends, rest on this rock. 
###CLITUS
Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come back. He’s been captured or killed. 
###BRUTUS
Sit down, Clitus. Killed, most likely—it’s become a trend. Listen, Clitus. (he whispers to CLITUS) 
###CLITUS
Who, me, my lord? No, not for all the world. 
###BRUTUS
Silence, then! Don’t give it away. 
###CLITUS
I’d rather kill myself. 
###BRUTUS
Listen, Dardanius. (he whispers to DARDANIUS) 
###DARDANIUS
Would I dare do something like that? 
###CLITUS
Oh Dardanius! 
###DARDANIUS
Oh Clitus! 
###CLITUS
(speaking so that only DARDANIUS can hear) What awful thing did Brutus ask of you? 
###DARDANIUS
(speaking so that only CLITUS can hear) To kill him, Clitus. Look, he’s meditating on what to do. 
###CLITUS
(speaking so that only DARDANIUS can hear) That noble man is so full of grief that it spills out of his eyes. 
###BRUTUS
Come here, good Volumnius. Listen a minute. 
###VOLUMNIUS
What is it, my lord? 
###BRUTUS
Just this, Volumnius. The ghost of Caesar has appeared to me at night twice. Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields. I know that my hour has come. 
###VOLUMNIUS
No, it hasn’t, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
No, I’m sure it has, Volumnius. You see how the world goes, Volumnius. Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave. 
##Faint sounds of battle.
It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us. Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together. For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it. 
###VOLUMNIUS
That’s not a job for a friend, my lord. 
##Continued sounds of battle.
###CLITUS
Run, run, my lord. We can’t wait here. 
###BRUTUS
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius. Strato, you’ve slept this whole time. Farewell to you too, Strato. Countrymen, my heart rejoices that in all my life I knew no men who were untrue to me. I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest. So farewell, all, for my tongue has almost finished with its life. I can’t see ahead of me. My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour. 
##Sounds of battle. Offstage, someone cries, “Run, run, run!”
###CLITUS
Run, my lord, run. 
###BRUTUS
Go on! I’ll follow. 
## CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS exit.
I beg you, Strato, stay by me. You’re a man with a good reputation. Your life has had honor in it. Then, hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it. Will you, Strato? 
###STRATO
Give me your hand, first. (holds BRUTUS' sword) Farewell, my lord. 
###BRUTUS
Farewell, good Strato. (runs on his sword) Caesar, you can rest now. I didn’t kill you half as willingly. (he dies) 
##Sounds of battle. Trumpets sound a retreat. OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, and LUCILLIUS enter with the army.
###OCTAVIUS
What man is that? 
###MESSALA
My master’s man. Strato, where’s your master? 
###STRATO
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala. The conquerors can only make a fire of him, because only Brutus triumphed over himself, and no other man gets to triumph in his death. 
###LUCILLIUS
It’s fitting that Brutus be found like this. Thank you, Brutus, for proving my prediction true. 
###OCTAVIUS
I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service. You, will you join with me? 
###STRATO
Yes, if Messala recommends me to you. 
###OCTAVIUS
Do so, good Messala. 
###MESSALA
How did my master die, Strato? 
###STRATO
I held the sword and he ran on it. 
###MESSALA
Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master. 
###ANTONY
This was the noblest Roman of them all. All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar. Only he acted from honesty and for the general good. His life was gentle, and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, “This was a man.” 
###OCTAVIUS
Let’s treat him according to his virtue, with all the respect and rituals of burial. His body will lie in my tent tonight, with the honorable observance that suits a soldier. So order the armies to rest, and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day. 
##Everyone exits.

##The CHORUS enters.
###CHORUS
If only we had divine inspiration, our play might rise to the highest level of imagination. If we had a stage as big as a kingdom, real kings and queens to act the part of kings and queens, and royalty to also witness the glorious spectacle, then it would be as it really was. Then valiant King Harry would resemble the god of war, as he did in life, and famine, sword, and fire would sit like dogs at his feet, waiting to be unleashed. But, ladies and gentlemen, since that’s not the case, you must forgive us plain, ordinary men who dare to act out so great a story on this humble stage. Can this theater seem to contain the sweeping fields of France? Could we even squeeze into this little theater the helmets that looked so frightening at Agincourt? Hardly! But, pardon us, because just as a few strokes of a pen, a few zeros, can signify a huge number, we, who are zeros in this great story, can work on your imagination. Pretend that within the confines of this theater sit two great kingdoms divided by a narrow but perilous ocean. Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections. Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army. Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth. Because now it is your thoughts that must dress up our kings and transport them from place to place. Your thoughts must leap over huge spans of time, turning the events of many 
years into the space of a few hours. To that end, consider me a sort of chorus, here to help tell the story. And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly. 
##The CHORUS exits.
##The Archbishop of CANTERBURY and the Bishop of ELY enter.
###CANTERBURY
My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign. Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off. 
###ELY
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord? 
###CANTERBURY
We have to think about that. If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work. Add to that a yearly sum of a thousand pounds to go directly into the king’s coffers. That’s what the bill says. 
###ELY
That would be quite a drain. 
###CANTERBURY
It would drain us dry. 
###ELY
But what can be done to prevent it? 
###CANTERBURY
The king is virtuous and kind. 
###ELY
And a true lover of the holy Church. 
###CANTERBURY
You wouldn’t have expected it based on how he acted as a youth. But no sooner had his father stopped breathing than the prince’s wildness died too. Really, at that precise moment he gained a capacity for reflection, which appeared like an angel to chase away the sinful part of him, leaving his body like a paradise, fit to house only lofty thoughts and feelings. You never saw anyone become serious and studious so quickly. You never saw such a total transformation, as though a wild river, rushing through, had swept away his faults. Such a collection of stubborn character flaws was never banished from one place so suddenly as in the case of this king. 
###ELY
We are fortunate in the change. 
###CANTERBURY
If you just listen to him discuss theological matters, you’ll find yourself thinking privately what an excellent bishop he would make. Hear him debate matters of domestic policy, and you’d swear he had made them his constant study. Listen to him talk about war, and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles. Bring up any political topic, and he’ll untangle it as easily as if it were his own garter. And the result is that when he speaks, the very air—which is free to go where it likes—stops dead, and men stand in silent wonder, hoping to catch the benefit of his gorgeous utterances. There must be skill and experience behind all this abstract thought, but it’s anyone’s guess how he obtained it, since in his youth he preferred shallow pursuits, with uneducated, crude and superficial companions. He spent his time drunken, overfed, and constantly seeking out entertainment, with no inclination for learning or quiet contemplation, nor any limit to his tolerance for public haunts and crowds. 
###ELY
Strawberries grow underneath nettle plants, and berries grow best when they’re planted next to inferior fruit. In the same way, the prince hid his serious side under the guise of wild behavior. Just like summer grass, which grows fastest during the night, this sober quality was able to grow and thrive all the better for being undetected. 
###CANTERBURY
That must be it, because the age of miracles is passed, and we have to find reasonable explanations for why these things happen. 
###ELY
But tell me, my lord: as to the softening of this bill proposed by the House of Commons, does his Majesty favor it or not? 
###CANTERBURY
He seems neutral, perhaps leaning a little more toward our side than that of our opponents—since I’ve made his Majesty an offer, following a meeting with our fellow bishops. The offer regards certain matters having to do with France that his Grace and I have been discussing. My offer would involve us giving him a greater sum than the clergy ever gave at one time to any of his predecessors. 
###ELY
How did he take the offer, my lord? 
###CANTERBURY
Favorably, except that there wasn’t enough time for his Grace to hear, as I sensed he would have liked to, the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France, and to the throne of France in general, through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather, Edward III. 
###ELY
What kept you from telling him this? 
###CANTERBURY
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king. And, in fact, I think they’re meeting together right now. Is it four o'clock? 
###ELY
It is. 
###CANTERBURY
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say—though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word. 
###ELY
I’ll accompany you. I’m also eager to hear it. 
##They exit.
## KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, and WESTMORELAND enter, with attendants.
###KING HENRY
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury? 
###EXETER
He’s not here. 
###KING HENRY
Send for him, dear uncle. 
###WESTMORELAND
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege? 
###KING HENRY
Not yet, cousin. Before I hear him, I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France. 
##The archbishop of CANTERBURY and the bishop of ELY enter.
###CANTERBURY
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time. 
###KING HENRY
Thank you, I’m sure. My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim. And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, that you should invent, twist, or distort your interpretation, or burden your conscience by subtly arguing for false claims. For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do. So think carefully before you incite me 
to wage war. I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say. For mighty kingdoms such as England and France have never gone to war with one another without much bloodshed, every innocent drop of which cries out against the wrongdoer who caused such loss of life without good reason. With this in mind, speak, my lord. And I will listen, consider, and earnestly believe that what you say is spoken with a conscience as pure as a newly baptized soul. 
###CANTERBURY
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne. There is no legal obstacle to your Highness’s claim to France except the following rule, which the French cite from King Pharamond: In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant (No woman shall inherit property in the Salic land). The French wrongly interpret “the Salic land” to mean France, and they cite Pharamond as the founder of this law that bars female succession to the throne. But their own authors assert that the Salic land is in Germany, between the Sala and the Elbe rivers, where Charles the Great left behind certain French settlements after conquering the Saxons. The French settlers despised the German women because they were unfaithful to their husbands, so the settlers passed this law that no woman should have right of inheritance in Salic land. And the Salic land—the region between the Elbe and the Sala, in Germany, as I said—is now called Meissen. It is clear, then, that the Salic law was not 
intended for the realm of France. Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred twenty-one years after the death of King Pharamond, incorrectly thought to be the founder of the law. He died in the year 426, and Charles the Great conquered the Saxons and settled Frenchmen in the region beyond the river Sala in the year 805. Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair. Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless). Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France. Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female. 
To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line. They prefer to obscure matters rather than reveal how corrupt their own claims to the French crown are. They usurped that crown from you and your ancestors. 
###KING HENRY
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim? 
###CANTERBURY
If not, mighty sovereign, let the blame be mine. For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours. Unfurl your banners of war. Take your mighty ancestors as models. Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives. Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen. O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing. 
###ELY
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again. You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins. You, my most powerful sovereign, are in the very prime of youth, ripe for glorious deeds and great enterprises. 
###EXETER
The other kings throughout the world all expect you to take the offensive, just like your lion-hearted forebears. 
###WESTMORELAND
They know your Grace has justification, as well as the money and military strength. And so you do. No king of England was ever backed by wealthier nobles or more loyal subjects. Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already. 
###CANTERBURY
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire. And to that end, we, the clergy, will raise your Highness a sum greater than your ancestors were ever given at any one time. 
###KING HENRY
We must not only arm ourselves to invade France, but must also apportion troops to defend against invasion by the Scots, who will see this as a perfect opportunity to attack. 
###CANTERBURY
Your subjects in the north, gracious sovereign, will provide a wall of defense against Scottish thieves across the border. 
###KING HENRY
I don’t mean merely bands of thieves. What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor. You’ll find that my great-grandfather never went to war with France without Scotland making an attack on his undefended kingdom, pouring in full force like the tide through a gap in a dyke, troubling the depleted country with violent attacks, and laying siege to towns and castles. The whole of England, being unprotected, trembled with fear. 
###CANTERBURY
But the country was more frightened than hurt, my liege. Take this example: when all its knights have been in France and all its noblemen absent, England has not only defended itself well, but actually seized the Scottish king and penned him up like a stray dog. Then he was sent off to France. He enhanced King Edward’s fame, adding royalty to his captives and thus making England’s own history as rich with glory as the muddy floor of the sea is rich with sunken ships and innumerable treasures. 
###ELY
But here’s an old, true saying: “If you want to win France, start with Scotland.” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey, the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and, like the mouse when the cat’s away, destroy more than she can actually eat. 
###EXETER
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home. But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves. While the armed hand fights in foreign lands, the wise head defends itself at home. For though the state is divided into different levels and functions, it all works in agreement for a unified purpose, a natural and perfect end such as we find in music. 
###CANTERBURY
That is why God divided humanity into various functions, so as to keep human endeavor moving ever forward, the one single fixed element—the aim—being obedience. Honey bees operate in just such a communal way. In fact, you can learn a lot about how to run a well-ordered kingdom from these creatures. They have a king and officers of sorts. Some, like magistrates, dole out punishment at home, while others venture forth for commerce, like merchants. Still others, armed like soldiers with stingers, pillage the summer flowers, bringing the booty triumphantly home to the royal tent of their emperor, who is preoccupied with governing. The emperor supervises the masons as they build gold roofs, the ordinary citizens as they process the honey, the humble laborers as they crowd through the city’s narrow gate with their heavy burdens, and the solemn-looking judge (with his grouchy hum) as he delivers lazy, unproductive drones to pale executioners. From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a sundial unite at its center. Just so, a thousand actions, once set in motion, will result in one desired object, and all will be well carried out and have a successful end. Therefore, head to France, my liege! Divide your lucky England into four. If you take even one quarter with you to France, you will nevertheless make the whole country shake. 
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation. 
###KING HENRY
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin. 
##Some attendants exit.
Now I’ve made up my mind, and with God’s help—and yours, you nobles who are the mainstay of my power—I’ll force France to fear me, or I’ll break her into pieces, as she’s rightfully mine. Either I’ll sit, ruling with absolute authority over France and all her dukedoms, or I’ll lay these bones in a common grave, with no stone or inscription over them. Either the story of my deeds will be declaimed loudly and without restraint, or else my grave will remain speechless, like a Turkish mute, not honored with even an epitaph etched in wax. 
##French AMBASSADORS enter.
I’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say—for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him, not the king. 
###FIRST AMBASSADOR
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey? Or should we be tactful and only hint at what the Dauphin sent us to say? 
###KING HENRY
I am no tyrant but a Christian king, whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons. Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint. 
###FIRST AMBASSADOR
Here it is then, in as few words as possible. Your Highness recently sent word to France claiming certain dukedoms as your own, in the name of your great ancestor, King Edward the Third. By way of answer, the prince our master says that you’re acting like the immature youth that you are. He warns you to take note: there’s nothing in France that you can win by dancing. You can’t party your way into dukedoms there. He therefore sends you this casket of treasure as a gift more suited to your character. And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms. This is the Dauphin’s message. 
###KING HENRY
What’s the treasure, uncle? 
###EXETER
Tennis balls, my liege. 
###KING HENRY
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor. Thank you for his present and your trouble. Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court. Tell him he’s got himself such a willing opponent that we’ll be chasing balls all over France. And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days. He doesn’t realize how useful they were to me. For a long time, I didn’t value this humble throne of England, and therefore lived at some remove and gave myself over to riotous living. Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home. But tell the Dauphin I will retain the dignity of kingship and appear all the more royal and glorious on the throne of France. Precisely for this purpose I went about like a commoner and experienced the life of the ordinary man. Now I’ll rise there with 
such glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France. I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be struck blind. And tell the laughing prince that this joke of his has transformed his tennis balls into cannon balls, and the destructive vengeance they bring with them will be his responsibility. His mocking will mock many thousands of widows out of their husbands. It will mock mothers out of their sons, and mock castles down. There are people yet unborn and unconceived who will have reason to curse the Dauphin’s scorn. But all this lies with God, to whom I do appeal. In God’s name, inform the Dauphin I am coming, to avenge myself and to put forth my rightful hand in a sanctified cause. So go in peace. And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it. (to attendants) Give them safe conduct.—Farewell. 
##The AMBASSADORS exit, with some attendants.
###EXETER
That was a humorous message. 
###KING HENRY
I hope to make the sender blush for it. Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition. My thoughts are now bent entirely on France—except my thoughts about God, who takes precedence over this undertaking. Therefore, let’s set about mustering the requisite number of troops and give consideration to anything that can be expected to speed our enterprise. For, with God on our side, we’ll chastise this prince on his father’s own doorstep. Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken. 
##Trumpets sound.
##They all exit.
##The CHORUS enters.
###CHORUS
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet. Armorers are doing great business, and all men think about is honor. People are selling off their land to buy warhorses so they can follow the exemplary king into battle as if they had winged feet, like Mercury. There’s a sense of anticipation in the air. In the minds of Harry and his followers, visions of the kingdoms, spoils, and titles to be won eclipse thoughts of actual fighting. The French, meanwhile, have been forewarned of all this preparation by their spies and tremble in fear. They seek to derail the English with cowardly tricks. Oh, England! You are physically small but inwardly great, like a mighty heart enclosed in a small body. There is nothing you couldn’t accomplish if all your subjects were loyal and loving! But, see, the king of France has detected your weak spot: a nest of faithless traitors, whose treachery he has purchased with gold. Three corrupt men—Richard, earl of Cambridge; Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham; and Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland—have agreed to conspire with the French in exchange for money. The gracious king will die by their hands in Southampton before he sets sail for France—if Hell and treason have their way. Stick with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we’ll make a play, conquering space and time. Imagine that the traitors have been paid and made their choice. The king has left London, and the scene now 
shifts, friends, to Southampton. That’s where you must pretend the theater is; that’s where you must sit. From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage. For if we can help it, we’d just as soon nobody was made sick by our play. But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears. 
##The CHORUS exits.
##Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH enter.
###BARDOLPH
Good to see you, Corporal Nym. 
###NYM
Good day, Lieutenant Bardolph. 
###BARDOLPH
Tell me, are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet? 
###NYM
For my part, I really don’t care. I don’t say much, but when the time comes, we’ll smile at each other. But that’s as it may be. I won’t fight, but I can close my eyes and take a swipe with my sword—just a simple sword, but so what? It’s good enough to toast cheese, and it will survive cold as well as another man’s sword. And that’s that. 
###BARDOLPH
I’ll buy you both breakfast if it will make you two friends. Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France. How about it, Corporal Nym? 
###NYM
Well, I will live until I die, that’s for sure, and when I can’t live anymore, I’ll deal with it. That’s it. That’s really all I can say. 
###BARDOLPH
It’s true, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly. And it’s true that she did you wrong, since you were engaged to her. 
###NYM
It’s not for me to say. Things are what they are. Men may sleep, and when they do they may have their throats with them, and some people say knives have blades. What must be must be, and though my patience is worn out, it will last a little longer. There must be some resolution. Well, it’s not for me to say. 
##PISTOL and HOSTESS QUICKLY enter.
###BARDOLPH
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife. Be cool now, corporal.—How are you, Pistol, my good host? 
###PISTOL
You peasant dog, are you calling me a host? I swear, I scorn the word. My Nell isn’t going to be taking any lodgers. 
###HOSTESS QUICKLY
No, not for long, that’s certain. For we couldn’t even put up a dozen or so nice girls who make an honest living sewing without our neighbors thinking we were running a brothel. 
## NYM and PISTOL draw their swords.
Oh, dear. If he isn’t cut down in his tracks right now, we’ll see willful adultery and murder committed. 
Good lieutenant, good corporal, don’t fight each other here. 
###NYM
Pish! 
###PISTOL
Pish to you, you mangy dog, you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt. 
###HOSTESS QUICKLY
Corporal Nym, be a man and put away your sword. 
###NYM
Get lost, will you? (to PISTOL) I’d like to get you solus. 
###PISTOL
Solus, you unspeakable dog? You loathsome snake, I throw your solus in that weird face of yours, in your teeth and your throat and in your hateful lungs, and even worse, in your nasty mouth! Shove that solus into your bowels, because I can take you. My gun is cocked and ready to fire. 
###NYM
I am not some fiend of hell: you can’t get rid of me with spells. I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good. If you get nasty with me, Pistol, I’ll stab you with my sword, in fair play. If you’d like to step aside with me, I’ll give you a little prick in the guts, all in fair play, if I can, and that’s the way it is. 
###PISTOL
You revolting braggart and hellish creature! Your grave is gaping open, and your death is near. So take your last breath. 
###BARDOLPH
Listen, listen to what I say: whoever strikes first, I’ll run him through with my sword, as sure as I’m a soldier. (drawing his sword) 
###PISTOL
That’s an oath of great power, and our fury must subside. ( PISTOL and NYM sheath their swords) Give me your hand—your forefoot. You have a brave spirit. 
###NYM
I’ll cut your throat, sooner or later—that’s just how it is. 
###PISTOL
Couple à gorge is the word for what you’re trying to say. I defy you again. You dog, do you think you’ll take my wife? No, go to the hospital, into the ward where they treat venereal disease, and get yourself a leprous, diseased prostitute like Doll Tearsheet and marry her. 
I won the former Mistress Quickly and I’ll keep her as my only wife, and—Damn it! That’s enough. Come on! 
##A BOY enters.
###BOY
My host Pistol, you must come to my master. You too, my hostess: he is very sick and should be put to bed. Bardolph, put your face between his sheets and act as a warming pan. Really, he’s very sick! 
###BARDOLPH
Get out of here, you punk! 
###HOSTESS QUICKLY
I swear, he’ll be food for the crows soon. The king has broken his heart. Good husband, come home soon. 
## HOSTESS QUICKLY and BOY exit.
###BARDOLPH
Come on, can I get you two to make up? We have to go to France together: why should we cut each other’s throats? 
###PISTOL
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food! 
###NYM
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet? 
###PISTOL
Paying debts is for peasants. 
###NYM
I’m going to take it from you now. That’s how it is. 
###PISTOL
We’ll see, won’t we? Do your best. 
##They draw their swords.
###BARDOLPH
By this sword, I’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust. By this sword, I will. 
###PISTOL
“By this sword” is an oath, and oaths must be kept. 
###BARDOLPH
Corporal Nym, if you want to be friends, be friends. If not, then you can be my enemy, too. Come on, put it away. 
###PISTOL
I’ll give you a noble right now, and I’ll give you liquor, too, and friendship and brotherhood. I’ll live for Nym, and Nym will live for me. Is that fair? For I’ll be selling provisions to the troops, and there’ll be profits to go around. Give me your hand. 
###NYM
I’ll get my noble? 
###PISTOL
In cash. 
###NYM
Well, then, that’s how it is. 
## HOSTESS QUICKLY enters.
###HOSTESS QUICKLY
If you ever had a mother, come in quickly to Sir John. The poor thing, he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see. Sweet men, come to him. 
###NYM
The king has done him a bad turn. That’s all there is to it. 
###PISTOL
Nym, what you say is true. His heart is broken and corroborate. 
###NYM
The king is a good king, but things must be as they may. He has his moods and his ways. 
###PISTOL
Let us go sit with the knight; for, my little lambs, we will survive him. 
##They all exit.
## EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND enter.
###BEDFORD
I must say, the king is taking a bold risk letting these traitors go free. 
###EXETER
They’ll be arrested in a little while. 
###WESTMORELAND
How smooth and cool they seem! Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful. 
###BEDFORD
The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea. 
###EXETER
No, but it’s unbelievable that the man who was his dearest friend, a man he has showered with love and favor, would repay the king with treachery, selling his own sovereign’s life to a foreign power! 
##Trumpets sound. KING HENRY, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, and GREY enter, with attendants.
###KING HENRY
Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship. —My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think? Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do? 
###SCROOP
No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best. 
###KING HENRY
I have no doubt about that, since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly, or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest. 
###CAMBRIDGE
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty. I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government. 
###GREY
True. Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly. 
###KING HENRY
Yes, I have great cause to be thankful. I’m more likely to forget how to use my own hand than how to reward virtue and merit as they deserve. 
###SCROOP
And so your subjects serve you all the more energetically, hopeful of success and reward. 
###KING HENRY
I expect no less. Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me. I believe he only did it because he drank too much, and now that he’s had a chance to think about his actions, I can pardon him. 
###SCROOP
That’s merciful but a bit careless. He should be punished, your Majesty. If we tolerate such behavior, we’re in danger of encouraging it. 
###KING HENRY
Oh, let us be merciful anyway. 
###CAMBRIDGE
Your Highness could be merciful but still punish. 
###GREY
Sir, it would be merciful to let him live after beating him severely. 
###KING HENRY
I’m afraid your great love and concern for me lead you to deal too harshly with this poor fellow. If minor lapses caused by drunkenness are not to be tolerated, how will we punish capital crimes that result from much planning and forethought? No, I’ll have that man released, despite the fact that Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their extreme concern for my safety, would prefer that he were punished. And now, let’s turn to our business with the French. Who are the new commissioners? 
###CAMBRIDGE
I am one, my lord. Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today. 
###SCROOP
You told me to do the same, my liege. 
###GREY
And me, too, my royal sovereign. 
###KING HENRY
In that case, there is yours, Richard Earl of Cambridge; there yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight, Grey of Northumberland, this one is yours. (he gives each of them a piece of paper) Read them, and trust that I recognize your true worth. My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter, we will set sail night.—Why, what’s this, gentlemen! What’s in those papers that makes you change color?—Look how pale they’re turning! Their cheeks are like paper.—What are you reading that makes you turn white? 
###CAMBRIDGE
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness’s mercy. 
###GREY AND SCROOP
To which we all appeal. 
###KING HENRY
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice. For shame, don’t talk of mercy. Your own arguments turn against you, like dogs who bite their own masters.—Princes and noble peers, take a look at these English monsters. Cambridge here, you know how I favored him and treated him with every respect due his rank. He was bought for a few coins, entering easily into this conspiracy with the French, promising to kill me here in Southhampton. And this knight, whom I’ve treated as generously as I have Cambridge, also joined the plot. But, oh, what can I say to you, Lord Scroop? You cruel, ungrateful, savage, and inhuman creature! You who had access to all my thoughts, who knew me to the inmost part of my soul, who could have had any amount of gold from me if you’d needed it and only asked me: is it possible that a foreign power could find in you even enough evil to injure one of my fingers? Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding. Treason and murder have always gone together, like two devils joined in a common purpose. That’s natural. But you, against all reason, added something new to the equation. You added the sheer improbability that you could do this. Whatever fiend it was that seduced you must win the prize for excellence in hell. All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds 
and patches of righteousness. But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor. The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people! Now I am suspicious of everyone. Are there men who appear dutiful? Why, so did you. Are there those who seem serious and knowledgeable? Why, so did you. Do they come from good families? Why, so did you. Do they seem religious? Why, so did you. Do they live in moderation, free from excessive emotion—stable rather than changing their minds constantly—tastefully dressed, not merely seeing but also listening, and trusting no impression without confirmation? That’s how sound a man you appeared. Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion. You have broken my heart. This treachery of yours is like the second Fall of man.—Their crimes are revealed. Arrest and punish them according to the law, and may God pardon them for what they would have done. 
###EXETER
Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason. Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason. Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason. 
###SCROOP
A just God has discovered our plot. I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death. 
###CAMBRIDGE
For my part, I didn’t do it for the money, though I admit the money encouraged me to do what I was planning sooner. But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me. 
###GREY
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking. Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person. 
###KING HENRY
May God in His mercy forgive you. This is your sentence. You have conspired against us with a proclaimed enemy and accepted his money in exchange for killing us. In doing so, you would have sold your king to slaughter, his princes and lords to slavery, his subjects to oppression and abuse, and his whole kingdom to ruin. I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws. So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure. And may you truly regret your terrible crimes. Take them away. 
## CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP, and GREY exit under guard.
And now, my lords, off to France. This invasion will be as glorious to you as it is to me. I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war, since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot. I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed. Let’s go forth, dear countrymen. Our strength is God. Let’s get going. We’re off to sea, banners flying. I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France. 
##They all exit.
## PISTOL, HOSTESS, NYM, BARDOLPH, and BOY enter.
###HOSTESS
Please, sweet husband, let me come with you as far as the town of Staines. 
###PISTOL
No, because my manly heart is grieving. Bardolph, be happy.—Nym, rouse your bragging spirits.—Boy, be brave. Falstaff is dead, and we must mourn him. 
###BARDOLPH
I wish I were with him, wherever he is—in heaven or in hell. 
###HOSTESS
Oh, no, he’s surely not in hell. He’s in Arthur’s bosom, if any man ever went to Arthur’s bosom. He died as peacefully as a baby. He departed right between twelve and one, just as the tide was turning. For after I saw him fumbling with the sheets and playing with imaginary flowers and smiling at the ends of his fingers, I knew it was the end. His face was gaunt and he was babbling about green fields. “Now, now, Sir John!” I said. “What’s all this? Cheer up!” And he called out “God, God, God!” three or four times. To soothe him, I told him not to think of God, that I hoped it wasn’t yet time to bother with such thoughts. So he asked me to put more blankets on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt his feet, and they were stone-cold. Then I felt his legs, and they were stone-cold, and so I moved upward and upward, and his whole body was stone-cold. 
###NYM
They say he cried out against sherry. 
###HOSTESS
Yes, he did. 
###BARDOLPH
And women. 
###HOSTESS
No, he did not. 
###BOY
Yes, he did. He said they were devils incarnate. 
###HOSTESS
He could never bear carnation. It was a color he never did like. 
###BOY
He once said the devil would get him because of women. 
###HOSTESS
He did touch on women a bit, but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon. 
###BOY
Don’t you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph’s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell? 
###BARDOLPH
Well, the fuel that sustained that fire is gone. That’s all the wealth I ever earned in his company. 
###NYM
Shall we get moving? The king will already have left Southampton. 
###PISTOL
Come, let’s be on our way. My love, let me kiss your lips. Look after my goods and possessions. Keep on your toes: the rule is “cash down, no credit.” Trust no one. For oaths are as easily broken as straws, and men’s faith crumbles like crackers, and you can only rely on what you can hold onto. Let caution be your guide. Go dry your eyes. Brothers in arms, we’re off to France—like leeches, my boys: to suck, to suck, their very blood to suck! 
###BOY
I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food. 
###PISTOL
Kiss her soft mouth, and we’ll be off. 
###BARDOLPH
Farewell, hostess. (kisses her) 
###NYM
I can’t kiss—that’s just how it is—but farewell. 
###PISTOL
Be thrifty. And keep yourself hidden, I command you. 
###HOSTESS
Farewell. Adieu. 
##They all exit.
##Trumpets sound. The KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, the CONSTABLE, the dukes of Berri and Bretagne, and others enter.
###KING OF FRANCE
The English army is advancing on us at full strength. It is more important that we respond majestically than that we respond carefully. Therefore the dukes of Berri, Bretagne, Brabant, and Orléans shall advance, and you, Prince Dauphin, will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves. The king of England’s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool. It is right for us to prepare like people who are afraid, as we’ve been taught by the recent lessons given us by the deadly and underestimated English on our own soil. 
###DAUPHIN
My most feared father, it is certainly appropriate for us to arm ourselves against the enemy, because even in peace time, when no war or conflict is at hand, a kingdom should not lose its edge, but always be ready—with defenses, men, and training—as though it expected a war. Therefore, I agree that we should all go and inspect those French territories that are weak. Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing. Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat. 
###CONSTABLE
Oh, please, Prince Dauphin! You are completely wrong about this king. Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message, how well supplied he was with good advisors, how restrained in expressing his displeasure, and, moreover, how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve. You’ll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that Lucius Junius Brutus adopted to deceive Tarquin—cloaking wisdom in folly the way gardeners cover the most delicate roots with manure when they first sprout up. 
###DAUPHIN
Well, you’re wrong, my Lord High Constable. But even if I thought you were right, it doesn’t matter. When it comes to defense, it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems. That way, we fill the gaps in our defenses. Otherwise, if we do it on the cheap, we’ll be like the miser who spoils his new coat by not buying quite enough cloth to make it. 
###KING OF FRANCE
I think King Harry is strong, so the rest of you princes make sure to arm yourselves to meet him with strength. His ancestors got their first taste of blood in battle with us, and he is born of that warlike strain that haunted us on our home ground. Reflect on the battle of Crécy, where, to our everlasting shame, all our princes were taken prisoner by the Prince of Wales, he whom they called Edward the Black Prince. Remember how his mountain-bred father, standing high on a mountain, 
crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies. This king is a branch of that same victorious stock. So let us be wary both of his inborn might and of his destiny. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Ambassadors of Harry, king of England, request a hearing with your Majesty. 
###KING OF FRANCE
We’ll see them immediately. Bring them right in. 
## MESSENGER and certain lords exit.
Notice, my friends, how closely this hunter follows his prey. 
###DAUPHIN
Turn and face them and you’ll stop the pursuit. The cowardly pack barks loudest when the quarry is way out front. My good King, surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over. Self-love, my liege, is not so great a sin as self-neglect. 
##The Lords and EXETER enter with followers.
###KING OF FRANCE
From our brother monarch, the king of England? 
###EXETER
Yes, from him. Thus he greets your Majesty. He commands you, in the name of God: give up. Relinquish the stolen titles that, by the gift of heaven and the laws 
of nature and of nations, belong to him and his heirs. That is, give up the crown and all the extensive titles that go with it, according to custom and long use. So that you’ll know this is no dubious or farfetched claim, he sends you his family tree, every line of which supports the claim. Look over this document, and when you see that he is directly descended from his most famous of famous ancestors, Edward the Third, he demands that you resign your crown and kingdom, which you wrongfully hold at the expense of himself, the true and natural owner. 
###KING OF FRANCE
And what will happen if I don’t? 
###EXETER
Bloodshed will force you to. No matter how deeply you hid the crown, even if you hid it in your own hearts, he’d dig it up. That’s why he’s coming after you like a fierce storm, with thunder and earthquakes like Jove could stir up. So, if asking you for the crown doesn’t work, he will force you to give it to him. In the name of God, then, he asks that you deliver up the crown. He says to take pity on the poor souls whom this ravenous war will swallow up. The widows' tears, the orphans' cries, the dead men’s blood, the girls mourning for their husbands, the fathers and the men they might have married will all be your fault. This is his claim, his threat, and my message. If the Dauphin is here, I have a message for him, too. 
###KING OF FRANCE
I’ll think it over. Tomorrow, I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England. 
###DAUPHIN
Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me. What’s the message from the English king? 
###EXETER
Scorn and defiance, indifference, contempt, and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you. And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face. 
###DAUPHIN
Say this: if my father sends a friendly answer, it is against my will. I want nothing but conflict with England. To that end, I presented him with the tennis balls, the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity. 
###EXETER
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe. And, make no mistake, you’ll find, as we his subjects have, an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now. Now he uses his time wisely, as you will see by your own casualties, if he remains in France. 
###KING OF FRANCE
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow. 
##A trumpet plays.
###EXETER
Don’t take too long, unless you want our king to come after me to ask what’s holding things up, because he’s already landed here. 
###KING OF FRANCE
You’ll have your answer soon. A night isn’t much time for addressing matters of this importance. 
##A trumpet sounds.
##They all exit.
##The CHORUS enters.
###CHORUS
And so, on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought, our scene flies swiftly on. Imagine that you have seen the well-equipped king at Dover pier set sail in full royal regalia and his noble fleet fan the rising sun with its silken banners. Give your imagination free rein. Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging. Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub. Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea, breasting the high waves. Pretend that you’re standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur. Follow it, follow it! Hitch your minds to this navy’s sterns and leave your England, silent as midnight, guarded by grandfathers, babies, and old women. For what male subject is there old enough for his chin to be graced with even one hair who doesn’t want to follow this select band of hand-picked knights to France? Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege. Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur. Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him 
his daughter, Katherine, with some insignificant, unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry. The offer doesn’t go over well, and the nimble gunner now moves to ignite the devilish canon. 
##Sounds of battle and gunfire from offstage.
Down goes everything in their path. Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings. 
##The CHORUS exits.
##Sounds of battle.
## KING HENRY enters, with EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers carrying ladders for scaling the walls that surround Harfleur.
###KING HENRY
Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses. In peacetime, nothing looks better in a man than restraint and humility. But when the battle trumpet blows in our ears, then it’s time to act like the tiger. With muscles taut and blood stirred up, hide your civilized nature under the guise of ugly rage. Lend your eyes a terrifying gleam and let them jut out from the portholes of the head like brass cannon. Make your brow jut out over your eyes like a frightening cliff over the wild and desolate ocean. Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare. Take a deep breath and draw on every impulse to its fullest strength. On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight. Don’t dishonor your mothers! Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you. Serve as an example to men of common birth and teach them how to fight. And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing. Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment. For there isn’t one of you so low-born that your eyes don’t shine with noble luster. I see you’re standing like greyhounds 
on a leash, straining for the moment when you’ll be let loose. The hunt is on! Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!” 
##They all exit to the sounds of battle and gunfire from offstage.
## NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and the BOY enter.
###BARDOLPH
On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the breach! 
###NYM
Please, corporal, stop! The fighting is too violent. Speaking for myself, I only have one life, not dozens. Too violent! That’s just how it is, the plain truth of it. 
###PISTOL
The plain truth doesn’t lie. You can see how it is all around. Fighting comes and goes, God’s loyal servants drop and die. (he sings)    And sword and shield    In bloody field    Will win immortal fame. 
###BOY
I wish I were in an alehouse in London! I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety. 
###PISTOL
Me too. (he sings)    If wishes could avail me,    My purpose would not fail me,    It’s there that I would go. 
###BOY
(singing)    As surely but more poorly    Than birds sing on the bough. 
## FLUELLEN enters.
###FLUELLEN
Up to the breach, you dogs! Go! Get a move on, you scrotems! 
###PISTOL
Great Duke, be merciful to mortal men. Calm your rage, your manly rage! Calm your rage, great Duke! Dear man, calm your rage. Be lenient, dearest! 
###NYM
This is healthy talk. Your Honor’s is unhealthy talk. 
##Everyone but the BOY exits.
###BOY
Young though I am, I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely. I am “man”—which is to say, servant—to all three of them. Yet not one among them, if all three were to wait on me, could be my “man,” because three such fakes don’t amount to a man. Take Bardolph: he is cowardly and blustery. He acts tough, but he doesn’t fight. Pistol, meanwhile, has a lethal tongue but an inert sword. He destroys words but keeps his weapon in one piece. As for Nym, he’s heard men of valor are men of few words, so he refuses to pray lest he should be thought a coward. But he has as few good deeds as he has bad words—for he never cracked anyone’s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything and call it spoils. Bardolph stole a lute case, carried it for thirty-six miles, and sold it for a penny and a half. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in crime, and in Calais they stole a fire shovel: I could see from that that they had no pride. They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs, which goes against my manhood, because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing. I must leave them and seek some better employment. Their villainy nauseates me, and I must therefore vomit it up. 
##He exits.
## FLUELLEN enters, with GOWER following.
###GOWER
Captain Fluellen, you must come straight to the tunnels. The duke of Gloucester wants a word with you. 
###FLUELLEN
The tunnels! Tell the duke I’m not so keen to come to the tunnels. For the tunnels, see, are not strictly in accordance with the proper practice of war. They’re not deep enough. For the enemy, see—and you can explain this to the duke, see—has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours. By Jesus, I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics. 
###GOWER
The duke of Gloucester, who has command over the siege, is in consultation with an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman indeed. 
###FLUELLEN
It’s Captain Macmorris, right? 
###GOWER
I think so. 
###FLUELLEN
Jesus, he’s an ass if there ever was one! I will say as much to his face. He knows no more about the proper practice of war, see—the ancient practices—than a puppy. 
##Captain MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY enter.
###GOWER
Here he comes with Captain Jamy, the Scots captain. 
###FLUELLEN
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman, that’s certain, one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare, I happen to know from his maneuvers. By Jesus, he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world. 
###JAMY
Good day to you, Captain Fluellen. 
###FLUELLEN
Good evening to your Worship, good Captain James. 
###GOWER
Tell me, Captain Macmorris, have you left the tunnels? Have the excavators stopped work? 
###MACMORRIS
Christ, it’s a disaster. The work is stopped, the trumpet has sounded the retreat. I swear by this hand and my father’s soul, the whole thing is a disaster. It’s all stopped. I could have blown up the town in an hour. Oh, it’s a disaster, a disaster, by this hand, it’s a disaster. 
###FLUELLEN
Captain Macmorris, I beg your pardon, but would you grant me a discussion or two with you, see, partly touching on or concerning the practice of war, the Roman wars, for the sake of argument, see, and friendly conversation? Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, see, of my mind, with respect to the demands of proper military practice—that’s the point? 
###JAMY
Oh, this is fine, good captains. And I’ll answer you, if I may, when I get a chance. Indeed I will. 
###MACMORRIS
This is no time to have a discussion. Christ! The day is hot and between the weather and the wars and the king and the dukes, it’s no time for a discussion. The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the gap, and we talk and do nothing, by Christ. It’s a disgrace to us all. God save me, it’s a disgrace, by this hand, when there are throats to be cut and work to be done, and nothing gets done, Christ save me. 
###JAMY
I swear by the mass, before I close my eyes to go to sleep, I’ll put in some good fighting, or I’ll lie in the ground dead. And I’ll kill as valiantly as I can, that’s for sure. That is the long and the short of it. But truly, I would love to hear the two of you discuss warfare. 
###FLUELLEN
Captain Macmorris, I think, see—correct me if I’m wrong—there are not many of your nation— 
###MACMORRIS
My nation? What is my nation? It’s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal. What is my nation? Who talks of my nation? 
###FLUELLEN
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects. 
###MACMORRIS
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself. So, by Christ, I’ll cut off your head. 
###GOWER
Now, now, both of you gentlemen! You go out of your way to misunderstand each other. 
###JAMY
Yes, and that’s a serious failing. 
##A trumpet tune that indicates a request for a ceasefire sounds.
###GOWER
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation. 
###FLUELLEN
Captain Macmorris, when we have more leisure, see, I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare, and that’s that. 
##They all exit.
##The GOVERNOR and some citizens appear on the walls, the English army below. KING HENRY and his train enter.
###KING HENRY
What has the governor of the town decided? This is the final discussion I will grant. So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst. For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes. The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants. What will it matter to me, since you will have brought it on yourselves, if sacrilegious war, dressed in red like Satan, his face blackened by smoke, should commit every form of savage destruction and ruin? What will it matter to me if your innocent maidens are raped, since you will have asked for it? What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling? We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting. Therefore, you men of Harfleur, take pity on your town and on your people while I still have control over my men, while the cool and moderate winds of mercy still have power to disperse the depraved, infected clouds of murder, plunder, and crazed soldiers defile your shrieking daughters with their foul hands, and your fathers dragged by their silver beards, their reverend heads dashed against the walls. Expect to see your naked babies skewered upon pikes while their 
grief-crazed mothers tear the clouds with their loud cries, just as the women of Judea did when Herod slaughtered their infants. What do you say? Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town? 
###GOVERNOR
Today our hopes are at an end. The Dauphin, whom we asked for reinforcements, sends back the answer that he’s not yet in a position to raise so great an army. Therefore, great king, we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy. Enter our gates and do as you like with us and our possessions, for we cannot defend ourselves any longer. 
###KING HENRY
Open your gates. 
##The GOVERNOR exits.
Come, uncle Exeter, enter Harfleur. Stay there and fortify it well against the French. Deal with them all mercifully on my behalf, dear uncle. Meanwhile, with winter coming on and sickness growing among our troops, we’ll withdraw to Calais. Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest; tomorrow we’ll march on. 
##Trumpets. The KING and his train enter the town.
## KATHERINE and ALICE enter.
###KATHERINE
(speaking in French, for the entire scene) Alice, you have been to England and you know the language. 
###ALICE
(speaking in French, for the entire scene) A little, madam. 
###KATHERINE
Please teach me English. I must learn to speak it. What is the word for la main in English? 
###ALICE
La main? That is “de hand.” 
###KATHERINE
“De hand.” And les doigts? 
###ALICE
Les doigts? Good lord, I forget les doigts. But it will come to me. The word for les doigts, I believe, is “de fangres.” Yes, “de fangres.” 
###KATHERINE
La main, “de hand”; les doigts, “de fangres.” I think I am a very apt student! I have learned two words of English already. What is the word for les ongles? 
###ALICE
“Les ongles?” That is “de nails.” 
###KATHERINE
“De nails.” Listen! Tell me if I’m saying it right. De hand, de fangres, et de nails.” 
###ALICE
Well done, madam. Excellent English. 
###KATHERINE
Tell me the English for le bras. 
###ALICE
“De arm,” madam. 
###KATHERINE
And le coud? 
###ALICE
“D'elbow.” 
###KATHERINE
“D'elbow.” Let me practice all the words you’ve taught me so far. 
###ALICE
It’s too difficult, I think, madam. 
###KATHERINE
I beg to differ, Alice. Listen: “de hand, de fangres, de nails, d'arma, de bilbow.” 
###ALICE
“D'elbow,” madam. 
###KATHERINE
Oh, Lord, I forgot! “D'elbow.” What is the word for le col? 
###ALICE
“De neck,” madam. 
###KATHERINE
“De nick.” And le menton? 
###ALICE
“De chin.” 
###KATHERINE
Le col, “de nick”; le menton, “de sin.” 
###ALICE
Yes. If I may say so, your Highness pronounces the words just like a native English speaker. 
###KATHERINE
I have no doubt I’ll learn it, and in a short time, too—God willing. 
###ALICE
You haven’t forgotten what you just learned? 
###KATHERINE
No, I’ll recite it for you right now: “de hand, de fangres, de nails—” 
###ALICE
“De nails,” madame. 
###KATHERINE
“De nails, de arme, de ilbow.” 
###ALICE
Forgive me, de elbow. 
###KATHERINE
That’s what I said, “de elbow, de nick, et de sin.” What are the words for le pied and la robe? 
###ALICE
“De foot,” madame, and “de count.” 
###KATHERINE
“De foot” and “de count”! Oh, Lord, those are vulgar words—wicked, ugly, immodest, not fitting for respectable girls to speak. I would not utter those words in the presence of the lords of France for all the world. Ugh! “Le foot” and “le count”! Nevertheless, I will recite my lesson one more time all together: “de hand, de fangres, de nails, de arm, de elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.” 
###ALICE
That is excellent, madame! 
###KATHERINE
That’s enough for one lesson. Let’s go to lunch. 
##They exit.
##The KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, the duke of BOURBON, and the CONSTABLE of France enter, with others.
###KING OF FRANCE
He’s certainly crossed the river Somme. 
###CONSTABLE
And if he advances unopposed, my lord, let us abandon France. Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation. 
###DAUPHIN
God alive! Shall a few offshoots of our nation, born of our father’s lust—our branches grafted to wild and savage trunks—grow to such a height that they look down with contempt on the plants from which they first sprang? 
###BOURBON
Normans, nothing more than bastard Normans, Norman bastards! I hope I die! If they march along unopposed, I will sell my dukedom for a sodden, filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion. 
###CONSTABLE
God of battles! Where do they get this spirit? Isn’t their climate foggy, cold, and dark? Doesn’t the sun shine palely down on them, as though in contempt, killing their fruit with frowns? Can boiled water (beer, they call it)—a drink for broken-down horses, heat their cold blood to such a valiant level? And shall our lively blood, quickened by wine, be so frosty? Oh, for the 
honor of our land, let us not hang like ropes of icicles off the thatched roofs of our houses while men of a more frosty temperament sweat off their own gallant youth in our rich fields! Our fields may be rich, but they are ruled poorly. 
###DAUPHIN
By faith and honor, our wives mock us, telling us brazenly that our vigor has been so bred out of us that they plan to give their bodies to the lusty youth of England to resupply France with men who, though bastards, will at least be warriors. 
###BOURBON
They tell us we’d be better off in English dancing schools, where we could teach the latest dances, as our grace is all in our heels; we are no better than high-class deserters. 
###KING OF FRANCE
Where is Montjoy, the herald? Send him on his way quickly. Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance. Rise, princes, and, with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords, rush to the battlefield: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; you dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois. High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights—for the sake of the great positions you hold, rid yourselves of this great shame. Stop Harry of England, who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur. Rush on his army the way the melting snow of the Alps spits on the low valleys below them. Descend on him: you have power enough. And bring him into Rouen as our prisoner. 
###CONSTABLE
Now that’s a mission worthy of great men! I’m only sorry that his numbers are so few and those men he has sick and starving on the march. When he sees our army, I’m sure his heart will sink with fear and he’ll offer us a large sum in exchange for avoiding battleof. 
###KING OF FRANCE
Have Montjoy hurry, then, Lord Constable, and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war. Prince Dauphin, you’ll stay with me in Rouen. 
###DAUPHIN
No, please, I beg your Majesty. 
###KING OF FRANCE
Be patient, because you’re staying with me. Go now, Lord Constable and all you princes, and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat. 
##They all exit.
## GOWER and FLUELLEN enter from opposite sides of the stage.
###GOWER
Greetings, Captain Fluellen! Have you just come from the bridge? 
###FLUELLEN
I assure you, there are some excellent military operations being carried out at the bridge. 
###GOWER
Is the duke of Exeter safe? 
###FLUELLEN
The duke of Exeter is as courageous as Agamemnonand a man whom I love and honor deeply, with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and my life, and my livelihood, to the very utmost of my being. He is not—God be praised and blessed—hurt in any way but is holding the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is a standard-bearer there at the bridge. I truly think he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony. He is a man of no rank or consequence, but I saw him fight as gallantly as though he were. 
###GOWER
What is his name? 
###FLUELLEN
He is called Ensign Pistol. 
###GOWER
I don’t know him. 
## PISTOL enters.
###FLUELLEN
Here he is. 
###PISTOL
Captain, I have a favor to beg of you. You’re on very good terms with the duke of Exeter. 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, God be praised, I have managed to earn his favor. 
###PISTOL
Bardolph, a soldier who is loyal and stout-hearted and full of valour, has, by a cruel trick of fate and a turn of silly Fortune’s wildly spinning wheel, that blind goddess who stands upon an ever-rolling stone— 
###FLUELLEN
Now, now, Ensign Pistol. Fortune is depicted as blind, with a scarf over her eyes, to signify that she is blind. And she is depicted with a wheel to signify—this is the point—that she is turning and inconstant, and all about change and variation. And her foot, see, is planted on a spherical stone that rolls and rolls and rolls. Truly, artists do wonderful things with the image of Fortune. She provides an excellent moral. 
###PISTOL
Fortune is Bardolph’s enemy. She frowns on him, for he has stolen a pax from a church and he must be hanged. A damnable death! It’s fine for dogs to be hung, but men should go free and not have their windpipes strangled with hemp. But Exeter has pronounced a death sentence—and for a cheap little pax. Therefore, go and speak for him! The duke will listen to you. Don’t let Bardolph’s life be brought to an end by a length of cheap rope and with this shame. Save his life, Captain, and I will repay you. 
###FLUELLEN
Ensign Pistol, I think I understand you. 
###PISTOL
I’m glad to hear it. 
###FLUELLEN
Actually, you shouldn’t be, because, see, even if he were my own brother I’d want the duke to stick to his plan and have Bardolph executed. Discipline must be kept. 
###PISTOL
Then die and be damned! And I’m giving the finger to your friendship! 
###FLUELLEN
Very well. 
###PISTOL
And the Spanish finger to you! 
##He exits.
###FLUELLEN
Very good. 
###GOWER
Why, that man is a total fraud and rascal. I remember him now. A pimp, a pickpocket. 
###FLUELLEN
At the bridge he spoke as excellently as anyone I’ve ever heard, I promise you. But that’s alright. What he just said to me—it’s alright. I assure you, when the time comes— 
###GOWER
Why, he’s a fool, an idiot, a moron, a man who now and then joins the army so as to be able to give himself airs when he gets back to London and masquerades as a soldier. Such fellows have memorized the names of famous commanders, and they can tell you—having learned such things by rote, not by experience—where this or that battle was fought, at such and such fort, at such and such wall, with such and such protective escort. And they can say who fought well, who was 
shot, who was disgraced, what terms the enemy insisted on. And they study how to express these things in proper military jargon, which they embellish with fashionable oaths. And what a beard trimmed like the general’s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale, you wouldn’t believe. But you must learn to recognize such liars, or you will be greatly taken advantage of. 
###FLUELLEN
I tell you what, Captain Gower; I perceive that he is not the man that he would have the world think he is. If I find an opportunity, I will give him a piece of my mind. 
##KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers enter, with a drum roll and military flags.
Listen. The king is coming, and I must speak with him about what went on at the bridge.—God bless your Majesty! 
###KING HENRY
Tell me, Fluellen: did you just come from the bridge? 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, your Majesty. The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly. The French have retreated, see, and there were great acts of courage. Indeed, the enemy nearly took the bridge, but he was forced to retreat, and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge. I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a brave man. 
###KING HENRY
What men have you lost, Fluellen? 
###FLUELLEN
The enemy’s losses have been very great, pretty substantial. To tell the truth, though, I think the duke hasn’t lost a single man, except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph—I don’t know if your Majesty knows the man. His face is all pustules and pockmarks, and pimples and inflammation, and his lips blow up toward his nose, which is like a red-hot coal, sometimes blue, sometimes red. But his nose is dead, and the fire’s put out. 
###KING HENRY
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way, and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages, nothing taken that is not paid for, none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language. For when mercy and cruelty compete for a kingdom, the gentler player is bound to win. 
##A trumpet plays. MONTJOY enters.
###MONTJOY
You know from my clothing who I am. 
###KING HENRY
Well then, I know who you are. What do you have to tell me? 
###MONTJOY
My master’s decision. 
###KING HENRY
Go ahead. 
###MONTJOY
My king says this: “Tell Harry of England: though we appeared dead, we were only asleep. Strategy makes a better soldier than haste. Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened. Now the time is right for us to speak, and we do so with imperial authority. The king of England will regret his foolishness, discover his weakness, and marvel at our restraint. Tell him therefore to consider what ransom he can offer as a prisoner of war. It must be commensurate with the losses we have suffered, the subjects we 
have lost, and the indignity we have endured, for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back. His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses, his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed, and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with. Add defiance to all this and, by way of conclusion, tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him, whose death sentence has been pronounced.” My king and master’s message delivered, my task is done. 
###KING HENRY
What is your name? I know your position. 
###MONTJOY
Montjoy. 
###KING HENRY
You do your job well. Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference, for—to be honest, though it’s probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage—my men are considerably weakened by illness, my numbers reduced, and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen, though when they were in good form, I tell you, herald, I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs. But God forgive me for bragging. It’s a vice I’ve picked up since I’ve been here, and I must get rid of it. Anyway, go tell your master I am here. My ransom is my own fragile, worthless body, my army but a weak and sickly escort. But, before God, tell him we will advance, even if the king of France himself and another foe as strong should stand in our way. (giving him money) That’s for your trouble, Montjoy. Go tell your master to consider carefully. If we’re allowed to pass, we will. If we’re prevented, we’ll discolor your golden ground with your red blood. And so, Montjoy, farewell. This is our whole answer: We do not seek a battle nor will we avoid one. Tell your master this. 
###MONTJOY
I’ll deliver the message. I thank your Highness. 
##He exits.
###GLOUCESTER
I hope they don’t attack us now. 
###KING HENRY
We’re in God’s hands, brother, not in theirs. March to the bridge. Night is approaching. We’ll set up camp across the river and continue on tomorrow. Give the order to march. 
##They all exit.
##The CONSTABLE of France, Lord RAMBURES, ORLÉANS, and the DAUPHIN enter, with others.
###CONSTABLE
Nonsense. I have the best armor in the world. I wish it were day! 
###ORLÉANS
You have wonderful armor, but give my horse his due. 
###CONSTABLE
It is the best horse in Europe. 
###ORLÉANS
Will it never be morning? 
###DAUPHIN
My lord of Orléans, and my lord high Constable, are you talking about horses and armor? 
###ORLÉANS
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world. 
###DAUPHIN
What a long night this is! I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs. He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs. He’s a flying horse, a Pegasus, breathing fire out of his nostrils. When I sit astride him, I soar, I am a hawk. He trots on air. The earth sings when he touches it. The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan’s pipe. 
###ORLÉANS
He’s the color of nutmeg. 
###DAUPHIN
And hot as ginger. He is an animal worthy of Perseus. He is pure air and fire. The duller elements of earth and water have no part in him, except in the moment of patient stillness when his rider mounts him. He is indeed worthy of the name “horse,” and you can call all the rest beasts. 
###CONSTABLE
Indeed, my lord, he is a perfectly wonderful horse. 
###DAUPHIN
He is the prince of horses. His neigh is like a monarch’s command. His face demands respect. 
###ORLÉANS
Enough, cousin. 
###DAUPHIN
No, the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever. It’s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea. If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize, my horse would be a topic for them all. He is a subject for a king to contemplate, and for a king’s king to ride on, and for the world at large—both friend and stranger—to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at. I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began, “Wonder of nature—” 
###ORLÉANS
I have heard a sonnet to one’s mistress that began like that. 
###DAUPHIN
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed, for my horse is my mistress. 
###ORLÉANS
Your mistress is a good mount. 
###DAUPHIN
A good mount for me—and that’s the highest praise and very definition of a good mistress, that she belong to one alone. 
###CONSTABLE
Yes, but yesterday I could have sworn your mistress gave you a bumpy ride. 
###DAUPHIN
So, perhaps, did yours. 
###CONSTABLE
Mine wasn’t wearing a bridle. 
###DAUPHIN
Oh, then I guess she was old and gentle, and you rode barelegged, like an Irish yokel. 
###CONSTABLE
You’re a good judge of horsemanship. 
###DAUPHIN
Take a tip from me, then. Those who don’t take care when they ride often find themselves thrown into a messy situation. I’d rather have my horse than a mistress. 
###CONSTABLE
I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse. 
###DAUPHIN
I’ll tell you this, Constable, my mistress has his own hair. 
###CONSTABLE
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress. 
###DAUPHIN
“The dog returns to its own vomit, and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle.” You’d take anything for a mistress. 
###CONSTABLE
At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point. 
###RAMBURES
My Lord Constable, are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight? 
###CONSTABLE
Stars, my lord. 
###DAUPHIN
I hope some will fall off tomorrow. 
###CONSTABLE
And yet I’ll still have plenty. 
###DAUPHIN
No doubt, for you wear too many in the first place, and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer. 
###CONSTABLE
Yes, like your horse, who, staggering under your boasts, would trot more easily if some of them dismounted. 
###DAUPHIN
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves! Oh, will it never be day? I will ride out a mile tomorrow and leave the road paved with the faces of dead Englishmen. 
###CONSTABLE
I’d say the same thing, but I’m afraid I’d be faced out of my way. But I do wish it were morning, for I long to be mixing it up with the English. 
###RAMBURES
Would anyone like to bet twenty prisoners with me? 
###CONSTABLE
You’ll have to take some chances yourself before you catch them. 
###DAUPHIN
It’s midnight. I’ll go put my armor on. 
##He exits.
###ORLÉANS
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning. 
###RAMBURES
He wants to eat the English. 
###CONSTABLE
I think he’ll eat everyone he kills. 
###ORLÉANS
By my mistress’s white hand, he’s a gallant prince. 
###CONSTABLE
Swear by her foot, so she can stamp out the oath. 
###ORLÉANS
He’s definitely the most active gentleman of France. 
###CONSTABLE
Performing is activity, and he is always doing that. 
###ORLÉANS
He never did harm that I heard of. 
###CONSTABLE
And he’s not going to do any tomorrow. That part of his reputation will stand. 
###ORLÉANS
I know him to be valiant. 
###CONSTABLE
I was told that by one who knows him better than you. 
###ORLÉANS
Who was that? 
###CONSTABLE
Why, he told me so himself, and he said he didn’t care who knew it. 
###ORLÉANS
He doesn’t have to care. His virtue is not hidden. 
###CONSTABLE
Oh, but it is, sir. No one but his valet ever saw it. His courage is hidden, and when it is revealed, it will shrink. 
###ORLÉANS
Ill will never prompted anything well said. 
###CONSTABLE
I’ll challenge that proverb with one of my own: “There is flattery in friendship.” 
###ORLÉANS
And I’ll match that with “Give the devil his due.” 
###CONSTABLE
Very apt! Your friend is equated with the devil. I’ll go straight for that proverb with “To hell with the devil.” 
###ORLÉANS
You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as “A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark.” 
###CONSTABLE
You have overshot. 
###ORLÉANS
I’ve outshot you, and not for the first time. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents. 
###CONSTABLE
Who measured the ground? 
###MESSENGER
The Lord Grandpré. 
###CONSTABLE
A very valiant and knowledgeable gentleman. If only it were day! Poor Harry of England! He doesn’t long for the dawn as we do. 
###ORLÉANS
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is, to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity. 
###CONSTABLE
If the English had any sense, they would run away. 
###ORLÉANS
Well, obviously they don’t. If there were anything inside their heads, they could never wear such heavy helmets. 
###RAMBURES
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures. Their hounds are unequaled in courage. 
###ORLÉANS
Foolish dogs, blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples. You might just as well say, “That’s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion.” 
###CONSTABLE
Yes, exactly. And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud, showy ferocity, too, leaving their brains behind with their wives. Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel, and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils. 
###ORLÉANS
Yes, but these English are seriously short of beef. 
###CONSTABLE
Then tomorrow we’ll find that they feel only like eating, not like fighting. It’s time to put our armor on. Shall we get started? 
###ORLÉANS
It’s two o'clock now. But let me see, by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen. 
##They all exit.
##The CHORUS enters.
###CHORUS
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe. From camp to camp through the dark cave of night, the noise from both armies grows so quiet that those standing watch almost think they can hear the whispered secrets of one another’s sentinels. One by one, fires are lit on both sides, and through their pale flames, each army thinks he sees the smoke-tinged faces of the other. The horses of each army answer one another’s proud, threatening neighs as they pierce the dull night, and from the tents the sound of the blacksmiths' hammers as they fit out the knights, closing rivets up, adds a note of fear to the preparations. The country cocks crow and the clocks toll, sounding a drowsy three o'clock in the morning. Proud of their army and secure in their numbers, the confident and overeager French play dice, betting on how many worthless Englishmen each will capture. They scold the limping, slowly moving night, which, like an ugly old woman, takes so long to pass. The poor doomed English, like sacrificial beasts, sit patiently, and privately contemplate the dangers that will arrive with morning. With their grave faces, emaciated cheeks, and war-torn coats, they seem to the gazing moon like so many horrifying ghosts. Now, whoever spots the royal captain of this ruined army walking from camp to camp, from tent to tent, let him cry “Praise and glory on his head!” For out he goes visiting all his troops. He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls 
them brothers, friends, and countrymen. There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color. Instead, he looks fresh and covers any signs of fatigue with a show of cheerfulness and sweet majesty that every sad and pale wretch takes comfort in when they see him. His generous eye notices everyone, doling out a bounty as far-reaching as the sun, thawing cold fear, so that low and well-born alike may all experience (for want of a better way of putting it) a little touch of Harry in the night. With that, our scene rushes on toward the battle, which we will represent with four or five worn-out fencing foils, a travesty of battle—forgive us!—that disgraces the name of Agincourt. Still, stay to watch, imagining the way it really was from our own inadequate imitation. 
##The CHORUS exits.
##KING HENRY enters with BEDFORD and GLOUCESTER.
###KING HENRY
Gloucester, it’s true that we are in great danger. But our courage should only be the greater for that. Good morning, brother Bedford. God Almighty, there must be some essential goodness even in evil, if men would only look for it. In our case, our bad neighbors over their make us early risers, a healthy and sensible thing to be. Besides, they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all, a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death. Think like that, and you’ll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself. 
## ERPINGHAM enters.
Good morning, old Sir Thomas Erpingham! A nice, soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France’s hard, cold ground. 
###ERPINGHAM
Not at all, my liege. I prefer these quarters, since they allow me to say, “Now I live like a king.” 
###KING HENRY
It’s good for men to be given an example of how to take pleasure in discomfort. It eases the spirit. And when the mind is engaged, the rest of the body, dead and dull before, wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity, like a snake shedding its dead skin. Lend me your cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers, give my regards to the princes in our camp. Say good day to them from me and ask them to come to my tent. 
###GLOUCESTER
We shall, my liege. 
###ERPINGHAM
Shall I accompany your Grace? 
###KING HENRY
No, my good knight. Go with my brothers to my English peers. I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company. 
###ERPINGHAM
The Lord in heaven bless you, noble Harry! 
##All but KING HENRY exit.
###KING HENRY
Bless you, old soul! Your words cheer my heart. 
## PISTOL enters.
###PISTOL
(speaking in French) Who goes there? 
###KING HENRY
A friend. 
###PISTOL
Declare yourself to me. Are you an officer? Or are you low, vulgar, and of the common people? 
###KING HENRY
I am a gentleman of a company. 
###PISTOL
Do you carry a pike? 
###KING HENRY
Exactly. What about you? 
###PISTOL
I’m as good a gentleman as the emperor. 
###KING HENRY
Then you’re a better man than the king. 
###PISTOL
The king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold, he’s a lively lad, a wag, born of fine parents, good with his fists. I kiss his dirty shoe, and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy. What is your name? 
###KING HENRY
Harry le Roy. 
###PISTOL
Le Roy? That’s a Cornish name. Are you with a Cornish company? 
###KING HENRY
No, I am a Welshman. 
###PISTOL
Do you know Fluellen? 
###KING HENRY
Yes. 
###PISTOL
Tell him I’ll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy’s Day and slap his head with it. 
###KING HENRY
You’d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day, or he might slap your head with it. 
###PISTOL
Are you his friend? 
###KING HENRY
Yes, and his relative, too. 
###PISTOL
Then I’m giving you the finger. 
###KING HENRY
Thank you. God be with you. 
###PISTOL
My name is Pistol. 
##He exits.
###KING HENRY
The name suits your fierceness. 
## FLUELLEN and GOWER enter.
###GOWER
Captain Fluellen! 
###FLUELLEN
In the name of Jesus Christ, keep it down! It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct, traditional principles and rules of war. If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great, I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey’s camp. I tell you, you would find the rituals of war and, I promise you, its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise. 
###GOWER
But the enemy is loud. You can hear them all night long. 
###FLUELLEN
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot? Think about it. 
###GOWER
I will lower my voice. 
###FLUELLEN
I’d be very glad if you would. 
## GOWER and FLUELLEN exit.
###KING HENRY
Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman. 
##Three soldiers, John BATES, Alexander COURT, and Michael WILLIAMS, enter.
###COURT
Brother John Bates, isn’t that dawn breaking over there? 
###BATES
I think it is. But we have no great reason to long for day. 
###WILLIAMS
That’s the beginning of the day we see, but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it.—Who goes there? 
###KING HENRY
A friend. 
###WILLIAMS
What captain do you serve? 
###KING HENRY
Sir Thomas Erpingham. 
###WILLIAMS
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman. Tell me, what does he think of our situation? 
###KING HENRY
We’re men beached on the sand, hoping to be washed out by the next tide. 
###BATES
He hasn’t told this to the king, has he? 
###KING HENRY
No, nor would it be right for him to. Though it’s not my place to say so, I think the king is, after all, only a man, the same as me. The violet smells to him the same as it does to me. The sky appears to him much as it does to me, and all his senses are those of a mortal man. Without his fine clothes, the king appears just like any other naked man. And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther. Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order. Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army. 
###BATES
He can act as brave as he wants, but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames, and I wish he were, too, and I with him, whatever the danger, so long as we were far away from here. 
###KING HENRY
I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart. I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is. 
###BATES
Then I wish he were here alone. He’d be sure to be ransomed, and many a poor man’s life saved. 
###KING HENRY
Oh, I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone, even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel. I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company, as his cause is just and honorable. 
###WILLIAMS
That’s more than we know. 
###BATES
Yes, and more than we should seek to know. It’s enough that we know we’re the king’s subjects. If his cause is wrong, our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it. 
###WILLIAMS
But if the cause is not just, the king himself will have a lot to answer for, when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying, “We died at such and such a place.” Some will be swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some for the wives that are destitute without them, some about the debts they owed, some for their children left unprovided for. I think few die well who die in battle. How can a person expect to resolve anything in a Christian manner when they’ve passed their lives killing? Now, if these men don’t die in a state of grace, it will be a heavy charge against the king who led them into battle, whom they, as his subjects, could not disobey. 
###KING HENRY
The king isn’t responsible for the particular end each soldier comes to, nor is the father responsible for his son’s final end or the master for his servant’s. The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services. Besides, there’s no king, however pure his cause, who, if it comes to a trial by combat, can rely on using completely blameless soldiers. Perhaps some may be guilty of plotting murder, some of seducing maidens with lies and then abandoning them; some, of looting and stealing before they were even hired as soldiers. Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home, they cannot escape God. War is God’s agent of justice. War is vengeance. So there are men here who have broken the king’s law earlier and are punished now in his war. When they feared death, they escaped with their lives; and now where they imagine they’re safe, they perish. So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for. Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain. Then if he dies, his death serves him. Or, if he doesn’t die, the time he spent preparing himself was at least blessed. And in the case of the man who survives, one could be forgiven for supposing that God spared him exactly because he was so ready to die; now he can live to appreciate God’s greatness and teach others to prepare.By this reasoning, if a son is sent by his father on business and drowns at sea while still in a state of sin, his wickedness is his father’s fault. Or if a servant, carrying a sum of money for his master, is attacked by robbers and dies without confessing his sins, we can say that the master’s business is to blame for the servant’s damnation. But that isn’t so. 
###WILLIAMS
It’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death. The king is not responsible for it. 
###BATES
I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him. 
###KING HENRY
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed. 
###WILLIAMS
Sure, he said so to make us fight cheerfully. But when our throats are cut, he could be ransomed without our being any the wiser. 
###KING HENRY
If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again. 
###WILLIAMS
Yeah, right, go get him. That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch. You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather. You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say. 
###KING HENRY
Your scolding is somewhat overblown. I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed. 
###WILLIAMS
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live. 
###KING HENRY
I’m game. 
###WILLIAMS
How will I recognize you in the future? 
###KING HENRY
Give me some trinket of yours, and I will wear it in my hat. Then, if you dare to acknowledge it, I’ll take up my quarrel with you. 
###WILLIAMS
Here’s my glove; give me one of yours. 
###KING HENRY
Here. 
###WILLIAMS
I’ll also wear this in my cap. If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear. 
###KING HENRY
If I ever see it, I will challenge you. 
###WILLIAMS
You may as well undertake to be hanged. 
###KING HENRY
I’ll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself. 
###WILLIAMS
Keep your word. Farewell. 
###BATES
Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have enough enemies on the French side, if either of you could count. 
###KING HENRY
Indeed, the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us, they have such an army. But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping. 
## BATES, COURT, and WILLIAMS exit.
Upon the king! “Let’s lay everything upon the king: our lives, our souls, our debts, our anxious wives, our children, and our sins.” I must bear responsibility for all of it. What a painful condition responsibility is. It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about. What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy? What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position? And what is this useless ceremony of kings? What kind of god is ceremony, which suffers more than its worshippers do? What income, what profit does it bring in? Oh, ceremony, only show me your value! Why are you adored? Do you amount to anything besides position, status, and ritual, which inspire awe and fear in others? You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you. What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery? Try being sick, great greatness, and see if ceremony can cure you! Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles? Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping? You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health? No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest. I who understand you, gorgeous ceremony, because I’m a king and I know that neither the balm, the scepter, and the ball, the robe layered in gold and pearls, the fancy title that precedes the king, the throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world —not all of these put together, not all of these laid down at night in an imperial bed, can cause the king to rest so soundly as does the miserable wretch who turns in at night with a full stomach and an empty mind, fed on the bread of his daily struggle. He never wakes to horrifying darkness, born of hell, but sweats in the hot sun from dawn to 
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace. Come morning, he wakes and helps the sun into his chariot and so wears out the ever-rolling years until his death. Apart from ceremony, this poor creature who spends his days in toil and his nights in sleep is better off than the king. The peasant enjoys his country’s peace without ever worrying his dull head about the vigil the king must keep to maintain that peace. 
## ERPINGHAM enters.
###ERPINGHAM
My lord, your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp. They’re anxious to see you. 
###KING HENRY
Good old knight, gather them all together at my tent. I’ll meet you there. 
###ERPINGHAM
Consider it done, my lord. 
##He exits.
###KING HENRY
Oh God of battles, bolster my soldiers' courage. Don’t let them know fear. Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage. And just for today, Oh, Lord, just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown! I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood. I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven, praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year. And I’ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard’s soul. I will do more, though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime, asking for pardon. 
## GLOUCESTER enters.
###GLOUCESTER
My liege. 
###KING HENRY
My brother Gloucester’s voice? Yes, I know why you’ve come. I’ll go with you. The day, my friends, and everything await me. 
##They exit.
##The DAUPHIN enters with ORLÉANS, RAMBURES, and others.
###ORLÉANS
The sun glints off our armor. Awake, my lords! 
###DAUPHIN
Mount up our horses! Bring my horse, lackey! Ha! 
###ORLÉANS
Oh, brave spirit! 
###DAUPHIN
He’ll take me through flood and field. 
###ORLÉANS
Is that all? How about air and fire? 
###DAUPHIN
Just the heavens, cousin OrlÉans. 
##The CONSTABLE enters.
Is it time, my Lord Constable? 
###CONSTABLE
Listen to our horses neighing, longing to be working. 
###DAUPHIN
Mount them and dig your spurs into their flanks so that their hot blood may spurt in English eyes and douse them with some of the spare courage we have around. Ha! 
###RAMBURES
What, you want them to weep our horses' blood? Then how will we see their own natural tears? 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
The English are in the field, French lords. 
###CONSTABLE
To our horses, you gallant princes. Let’s mount straight away. All we have to do is look at that poor starving army, and our wonderful display of strength will eat away their souls, leaving them the mere husk of men. There isn’t enough work out there to keep us all busy, and hardly enough blood in all their sickly veins put together to put a stain on each of our swords, which our French knights will take out and then put away again, with nothing to do. Let’s blow on them. The breath of our valor will send them sprawling. There’s no question, lords, but that those extra servants and peasants swarming uselessly around our battle formations would be sufficient to rid this field of such a good-for-nothing foe, while we ourselves stood at the base of this mountain idly looking on. But our honor wouldn’t stand for that. What’s there to say? Doing the very least will do the whole job. Let the trumpets sound the signal to mount up and march. Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender. 
## GRANDPRÉ enters.
###GRANDPRÉ
What are you waiting for, lords of France? Those island-bred skeletons, terrified for their bones, are an offensive sight on the morning field. Their ragged banners hang in shreds and the very air of France makes them shiver as it blows by. The god of war looks like a pathetic bankrupt in this miserable army, peeking timidly through a rusty visor. The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks, torches in their hands. The poor 
horses droop their heads, their flanks and hips sagging, pus seeping from eyes as pale as death, and in their colorless mouths, the motionless bit is smeared with chewed grass. Meanwhile, their executors, malicious crows, fly over them, impatient for their moment. It’s beyond the power of words to describe an army so bereft of life. 
###CONSTABLE
They’ve said their prayers, and now they wait for death. 
###DAUPHIN
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them? 
###CONSTABLE
I’m just waiting for my flag-bearer. But, never mind, I can’t wait. To the field! I’ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that. Come, let’s be off! The sun is up and we’re wasting the day! 
##They all exit.
## GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, ERPINGHAM, with his troops, SALISBURY, and WESTMORELAND enter.
###GLOUCESTER
Where is the king? 
###BEDFORD
The king rode out alone to view their troops. 
###WESTMORELAND
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men. 
###EXETER
That’s five to one. Besides, they’re fresh. 
###SALISBURY
May God’s arm strike on our side! These are frightening odds. God be with all of you, princes. I’ll go and join my men. If we don’t meet again before we meet in heaven, still we’ll meet joyfully. My noble Lord of Bedford, my dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter, and my kind kinsmen, warriors all, adieu. 
###BEDFORD
Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you. 
###EXETER
Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly today. But then I do you wrong to say as much, since you are the very embodiment of bravery. 
## SALISBURY exits.
###BEDFORD
He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both. 
## KING HENRYenters.
###WESTMORELAND
Oh, if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren’t working today. 
###KING HENRY
Who wishes that? My cousin Westmoreland? No, my dear cousin. If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us. In God’s name, I beg you not to wish for one more man. By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense. It doesn’t bother me when people borrow my clothing—I don’t care about these concrete things. But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive. No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead. By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory. Oh, do not wish one more! Instead, make this known throughout the army: whoever has no spirit for this fight, let him depart. He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home. We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us. This day is called the Feast of Saint Crispian: he who lives to see this day out and comes home safe will stand tall when this day is named and raise himself up at the mention of Crispian. He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve, saying, “Tomorrow is Saint Crispin’s Day.” He’ll roll up his sleeve and show his scars, saying, “I got these wounds on St. Crispin’s Day.” Old men forget. But these men will remember every detail of what they did today long after they’ve forgotten everything else. And as the wine flows, our names, familiar as household words, will be invoked again: Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester. Good men will tell their sons this story and the Feast of St. Crispin will never 
go by, from this day to the end of time, without our being remembered: we few, we happy few, we band of brothers—for whoever sheds his blood with me today shall be my brother. However humble his birth, this day shall grant him nobility. And men back in English now safe in their beds will curse themselves for not having been here, and think less of their own manhood when they listen to the stories of those who fought with us here on St. Crispin’s Day. 
## SALISBURY enters.
###SALISBURY
My sovereign lord, join us quickly: the French are all arrayed in battle formation and will charge us at any moment. 
###KING HENRY
We’re ready if our minds are ready. 
###WESTMORELAND
Let any man perish who isn’t ready now! 
###KING HENRY
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin? 
###WESTMORELAND
God Almighty, my liege, I wish that you and I could fight this royal battle all alone. 
###KING HENRY
There! Now you’ve unwished five thousand men, which I prefer to your wishing for one more.—You know your places. God be with you all. 
##A trumpet sounds.MONTJOY enters.
###MONTJOY
Once more I come to ask you, King Harry, if you’re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat. For assuredly, you are so near the abyss that you’re bound to be swallowed up. Moreover, out of mercy, the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent, so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where, poor wretches, their bodies will likely fall and fester. 
###KING HENRY
Who sent you this time? 
###MONTJOY
The Constable of France. 
###KING HENRY
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before. Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones. Good God! Why do they mock poor fellows this way? The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him. A good many of our bodies, I imagine, will end up in English soil. And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass. And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too. The sun will rise on them here and draw their glory up to heaven, leaving their mortal remains to choke your land: the smell of rotting flesh will breed a plague in France. 
Then will you notice the abundant valor of our Englishmen, who will embark on a second round of mischief like a ricocheting bullet, killing again as they fall to their deaths. Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers. Our finery and shining metal are all rusty from long, painful marches in the rain. There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army—a good sign, I hope, that we won’t fly away like birds—and time on the field has made us slovenly. But, by God, our hearts are in good shape. And my poor soldiers tell me that before night they’ll be in cleaner clothes. If not, they’ll pull the bright new coats of the French over their heads and send them on their way. If they do this, as they will, God willing, my ransom will soon be raised. Herald, spare yourself. Don’t come again to ask for my ransom, good messenger. I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine. And if the French get them in the state in which I intend to leave them, they won’t be worth much use to anyone. Tell the constable that. 
###MONTJOY
I shall, King Harry. And so farewell. You’ll never hear from the herald again. 
##He exits.
###KING HENRY
I’m afraid you’ll come to me again for ransom. 
## YORK enters.
###YORK
My lord, most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard. 
###KING HENRY
Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, advance. And you, God, bestow today’s victory however it pleases You. 
##They all exit.
##Sounds of battle. PISTOL, a FRENCH SOLDIER, and the BOY enter.
###PISTOL
Surrender, dog! 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) You seem like a gentleman of high rank. 
###PISTOL
Qualtitie calmie custure me! Are you a gentleman? What is your name? Expound. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Oh, God above! 
###PISTOL
This man, one O. Signieur Dew, must be a gentleman. Consider my words, O. Signieur Dew, and take note: O. Signieur Dew, you’ll be killed with my sword unless you pay me an absurd amount of money for your ransom. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Oh, have mercy! Take pity on me! 
###PISTOL
(mistaking moi, the French word for “me,” as a unit of money) One moy is not enough. I must have forty moys, or I will reach into your throat and pull out some moys, along with a lot of blood. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Is it impossible to escape your mighty arm? 
###PISTOL
(mishearing bras, the French word for “arm,” as “brass”) Brass, you dog! You damned lazy mountain goat, do you offer me brass? 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Oh, spare me! 
###PISTOL
Really? Is that a lot of moys? Come over here, boy and ask this slave in French what his name is. 
###BOY
(speaking in French) Look, what’s your name? 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Monsieur le Fer. 
###BOY
He says his name is Master Fer. 
###PISTOL
Master Fer! I’ll fer him, and firk him, and ferret him: expound as much to him in French. 
###BOY
I do not know the French for “fer,” and “ferret,” and “firk.” 
###PISTOL
Tell him to prepare himself for death, for I’m going to cut his throat. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French, to the BOY) What is he saying, sir? 
###BOY
(speaking in French) He told me to tell you to prepare to die, for this soldier here is of a mind to cut your throat without delay. 
###PISTOL
(trying to speak French) Yes, cut your throat, by God, you peasant, unless you give me gold coins, good gold coins. If not, you’ll be mangled by this sword of mine. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Oh, I beseech you, for the love of God, spare me! I am a gentleman of good family: spare me and I will give you two hundred écus. 
###PISTOL
What does he say? 
###BOY
He begs you to spare his life. He is a gentleman of a good family, and for his ransom, he will give you two hundred crowns. 
###PISTOL
Tell him my fury will abate, and I’ll take the crowns. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) Young sir, what does he say? 
###BOY
(speaking in French) Once again, that it would be breaking his oath to pardon any prisoner. Nevertheless, for the crowns that you’ve promised him, he is willing to give you freedom, liberty. 
###FRENCH SOLDIER
(speaking in French) On my knees I thank you again and again. And I consider myself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of a knight—to my mind, the noblest, most valiant, and most distinguished gentleman of England. 
###PISTOL
Explain, boy. 
###BOY
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, who is the bravest, most valorous, and thrice-worthy gentleman of England. 
###PISTOL
As I get to leech him, I will show some mercy. Follow me. 
###BOY
(speaking in French) Follow the mighty captain. 
## PISTOL and the FRENCH SOLDIER exit.
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart. It’s true what they say: “The empty vessel makes the greatest sound.” Bardolph and Nym had ten times more courage than this roaring stage villain, whose nails any Joe could cut with a wooden dagger, but they are both hanged. So would this man if he had the nerve to steal anything bravely. I have to stay with the servants, who are with our camp’s luggage. We’re sitting ducks for the French, if they only knew it, for there is no one guarding it but boys. 
##He exits.
##The CONSTABLE enters, with the Dukes of ORLÉANS, BOURBON, the DAUPHIN, and RAMBURES.
###CONSTABLE
O, hell! 
###ORLÉANS
O Lord, the day is lost! All is lost! 
###DAUPHIN
Dear God! All is lost, all! Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets, mocking us. 
##A brief blast of battle noises.
What stinking luck! Do not run away. 
###CONSTABLE
Our men have all broken ranks. 
###DAUPHIN
O, everlasting shame! Let’s fall on our swords. Are these the wretches that we threw dice for? 
###ORLÉANS
Is this the king we offered to ransom? 
###BOURBON
Shame, eternal shame, and nothing but shame! Let us die honorably. Back into the fray once again! He who will not follow me now, let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp, cap in hand, while some slave, no nobler than my dog, violates his daughter. 
###CONSTABLE
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us. Let’s go offer up our lives en masse. 
###ORLÉANS
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order. 
###BOURBON
The hell with order! I’m going back into battle. Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long. 
##They all exit.
##Sounds of battle. KING HENRY enters with soldiers, EXETER, and others.
###KING HENRY
We have done well, my valiant countrymen. But it’s not over. The French are still fighting. 
###EXETER
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects. 
###KING HENRY
Is he still alive, good uncle? Three times in an hour I saw him down, and three times up again and fighting. He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs. 
###EXETER
The valiant soldier is still dressed like that, lying on the ground, drenching the field with his blood. By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk, York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds. Suffolk died first, and York, cut to pieces, came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face, kissing his gashes. He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin. My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven. Wait for mine, sweet soul. We’ll fly there side by side, just as we stood together as brother-knights in this glorious and well-fought battle!” At this, I went to comfort him. He smiled at me close, gave me his hand, gripping me feebly, and said, “My dear lord, commend my service to my king.” With that, he turned and threw his wounded arm around Suffolk’s neck and kissed his lips. And so, 
married to death, he sealed a testament of love that even ended in nobility. The fineness of the moment moved me to tears. I tried to hold them back, but wept like a mother. 
###KING HENRY
I don’t blame you. Just listening, I have to school my misty eyes, or they will brim over. 
##Sounds of battle.
But listen! What new battle is this? The French have reinforced their scattered men. Then every soldier must kill his prisoners. Spread the word. 
##They all exit.
## FLUELLEN and GOWER enter.
###FLUELLEN
To kill the boys with the luggage! It’s expressly against the rules of combat. It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up. Tell me, don’t you think so? 
###GOWER
There’s certainly not a boy left alive, and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle. On top of this, they’ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king’s tent. So the king has quite rightly ordered that every prisoner’s throat be cut. Oh, he’s a gallant king! 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What is the name of the town where Alexander the Pig was born? 
###GOWER
Alexander the Great. 
###FLUELLEN
And is “pig” not the same as “great,” may I ask? The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous—they all mean the same thing, with some variation. 
###GOWER
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon. His father was Philip of Macedon, as I remember. 
###FLUELLEN
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born. I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar. 
There is a river in Macedon, and there is likewise a river in Monmouth. The river in Monmouth is called Wye, but the name of the other river has gone out of my head. Nevertheless, it’s all one—the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers, and there are salmon in both. If you look closely at Alexander’s life, Harry of Monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison—for there are analogies in everything. Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little the worse for drink, killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage, see. 
###GOWER
Our king is not like him in that respect: he never killed any of his friends. 
###FLUELLEN
It is not courteous, you know, to assume you know my meaning before I’ve finished talking. I’m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons. Just as Alexander killed his friend Cleitus when he was drinking, so Harry Monmouth, having come to his senses and acquired good judgment, turned away the fat knight in the oversized doublet: the man was full of jests and japes and pranks and mocks. I have forgotten his name. 
###GOWER
Sir John Falstaff. 
###FLUELLEN
That’s the one. I tell you, there are good men born at Monmouth. 
###GOWER
Here comes his Majesty. 
##Sounds of battle. KING HENRY enters with WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others.
###KING HENRY
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald. Ride out to the horsemen on that hill. If they seek battle with us, have them come down or else clear the field. The sight of them is offensive. If they’ll do neither, we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings. We’ll also cut the throats of any prisoners we have. Not a man of them that we shall take shall know our mercy. Go and tell them this. 
## MONTJOY enters.
###EXETER
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege. 
###GLOUCESTER
He looks humbler than he used to. 
###KING HENRY
Well? What is the meaning of this, herald? Don’t you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom? Are you coming again for ransom? 
###MONTJOY
No, great king. I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them, separating our nobles from the common men, for many of our princes—alas!—lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers. Likewise, our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes, and their wounded steeds, ankle-deep in gore, struggle and, raging wildly, stamp on their dead masters with their hooves, killing them a second time. Oh, give us permission, great king, to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies. 
###KING HENRY
I’ll be honest with you, herald: I don’t even know who won the battle. I still see many of your horsemen galloping across the field. 
###MONTJOY
You won it. 
###KING HENRY
God, not our strength, be praised! What is the name of the castle that stands over there? 
###MONTJOY
Agincourt. 
###KING HENRY
Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus. 
###FLUELLEN
If I may say so, your Majesty, your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales—or so I’ve read in the history books—fought a very brave battle here in France. 
###KING HENRY
They did, Fluellen. 
###FLUELLEN
Your Majesty is quite right. If your Majesties recall it, the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which, your Majesty knows, is to this day a badge of honorable military service. I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy’s Day. 
###KING HENRY
I wear it with pride, for I am Welsh you know, good countryman. 
###FLUELLEN
All the water in Wye cannot wash your Majesty’s Welsh blood out of your body. I can tell you that. God bless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases his Grace, and his Majesty, too! 
###KING HENRY
Thanks, my good countryman. 
###FLUELLEN
By Jesus, I am your Majesty’s countryman, and I don’t care who knows it. I will confess it to all the world. I needn’t be ashamed of your Majesty, God be praised, so long as your Majesty is an honest man. 
###KING HENRY
God keep me so.—Heralds, go with him. Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides. (pointing to WILLIAMS) Tell that fellow over there to come here. 
##English messengers exit with MONTJOY.
###EXETER
Soldier, you must come to the king. 
###KING HENRY
Soldier, why are you wearing that glove in your cap? 
###WILLIAMS
If it pleases your Majesty, it is the token of a man I must fight with, if he’s still alive. 
###KING HENRY
An Englishman? 
###WILLIAMS
If I may say so, your Majesty, he is a rascal who quarreled with me last night, and who, if he lives and ever dares to challenge this glove, will get a box on the ear from me. Or, if I see him wearing my glove in his cap, which he swore as a soldier he would wear if he lived, I will knock it off his head. 
###KING HENRY
What do you say, Captain Fluellen? Should this soldier keep his oath? 
###FLUELLEN
If I may say so, your Majesty, as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to. 
###KING HENRY
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree, quite outside of his own sphere. 
###FLUELLEN
Even if he were as important a man as the devil—as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself—he’s required, see, your Grace, to keep his vow. If he backs down, he’ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God’s earth, in my opinion. 
###KING HENRY
Then keep your vow, fellow, when you meet the man. 
###WILLIAMS
So I will, my liege. I swear on my life. 
###KING HENRY
Whom do you serve under? 
###WILLIAMS
Under Captain Gower, my liege. 
###FLUELLEN
Gower is a good captain, and is well versed and well read in the wars. 
###KING HENRY
Have him come to me here, soldier. 
###WILLIAMS
I will, my liege. 
##He exits.
###KING HENRY
Here, Fluellen, stick this in your cap. (gives WILLIAMS's glove to FLUELLEN) When Alençon and I went down together, I plucked this glove from his helmet. If any man challenges it, he is a friend to Alençon and an enemy to me. If you encounter such a man, arrest him and prove your loyalty to me. 
###FLUELLEN
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects. I’d like to see the man with two legs who takes offense at this glove, that’s all! Just once I’d like to see it, if it please God to grant me that. 
###KING HENRY
Do you know Captain Gower? 
###FLUELLEN
He is my dear friend, your Majesty. 
###KING HENRY
Go find him, please, and bring him to my tent. 
###FLUELLEN
I’ll fetch him. 
##He exits.
###KING HENRY
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, follow Fluellen at a close distance. The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear. It belongs to the soldier I was just talking to. According to an agreement, I should wear it myself. Follow Fluellen, cousin Warwick, and if the soldier strikes him—and I would think from his forthright manner that he’ll keep his word—some mischief may arise as a result. I know Fluellen to be very conscious of his honor and quick to anger, hot as gunpowder and 
likely to return any injury promptly. Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them. You come with me, uncle of Exeter. 
##They all exit.
## GOWER and WILLIAMS enter.
###WILLIAMS
I’m sure it is to knight you, Captain. 
## FLUELLEN enters, wearing WILLIAMS’s glove.
###FLUELLEN
As it is God’s will and pleasure, Captain, I entreat you to come quickly to the king. There is more good fortune in store for you than you could ever imagine. 
###WILLIAMS
Sir, do you recognize this glove? 
###FLUELLEN
Know the glove! I know the glove is a glove. 
###WILLIAMS
Well, I recognize this one (indicates the glove FLUELLEN wears in his cap), and I hereby challenge you. (strikes him) 
###FLUELLEN
Good God! As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world—or even France or England! 
###GOWER
What is this, you villain! 
###WILLIAMS
Do you think I’d break my oath? 
###FLUELLEN
Stand aside, Captain Gower. I’ll reward treason with blows, I promise you. 
###WILLIAMS
I’m not a traitor. 
###FLUELLEN
An infamous lie! I accuse you in the name of the king. Arrest him: he’s a friend of the duke of Alençon’s. 
## WARWICK and GLOUCESTER enter.
###WARWICK
Now, now! What’s all this? What’s going on? 
###FLUELLEN
My Lord of Warwick, a most corrupt treason—God be praised for it!—has been discovered, as plain as any you’d hope to see on a summer’s day. 
##KING HENRY and EXETER enter.
Here is his Majesty. 
###KING HENRY
Well, now! What’s the matter? 
###FLUELLEN
My liege, this man is a villain and a traitor, who—see, your Grace—has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alençon’s helmet. 
###WILLIAMS
My liege, this was my glove. Here is its mate, and the man I gave it to promised to wear it in his cap, and I promised to strike him if he did. I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word. 
###FLUELLEN
Your Majesty, see here—if it won’t offend your Grace—what a complete, rascally, beggarly, lousy rat this is. I hope your Majesty will, in all good conscience, bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me. 
###KING HENRY
Give me your glove, soldier: look, here is its mate. It was I, in fact, whom you promised to strike. And you spoke of me in the harshest terms. 
###FLUELLEN
If it pleases your Majesty, let his neck pay the price, if there is any martial law in the world. 
###KING HENRY
How can you square things with me? 
###WILLIAMS
All offenses come from the heart, my lord, and nothing intended to offend your Majesty ever came from mine. 
###KING HENRY
You abused me to my face. 
###WILLIAMS
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king. You represented yourself as just a common man. Consider the time of night, what you were wearing, and how ordinary you looked. Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise, I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine, because if you’d been what I took you for, there would have been no offense. Therefore, I beg your Highness, pardon me. 
###KING HENRY
Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with gold coins and give it to this fellow. Keep it, my friend, and wear it as a badge of honor in your cap until I challenge it.—Give him the money.—And you, Captain, must make it up with him. 
###FLUELLEN
By this day and this light, the fellow is certainly brave. Here, twelve pence for you. I urge you to serve God and stay out of brawls and dust-ups and quarrels and disputes. I promise it will be better for you if you do. 
###WILLIAMS
I’ll have none of your money. 
###FLUELLEN
It’s meant in good will. I tell you, you can use it to get your shoes fixed. Come, why be so hesitant? Your shoes are in pretty bad shape. It’s a good shilling, I promise you. If not, I’ll get another one for you. 
##An English HERALD nters.
###KING HENRY
Now, herald, have the dead been counted? 
###HERALD
Here is the count of the slaughtered French. 
###KING HENRY
What prisoners of rank have been taken, uncle? 
###EXETER
Charles duke of Orléans, nephew to the king; John duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt: of other lords and barons, knights and squires, a full fifteen hundred, besides common men. 
###KING HENRY
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield. Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles. Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights, squires, and brave gentlemen, five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday. Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries. The rest of the dead are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, and gentlemen of birth and rank. The names of those of their nobles that lie dead: Charles Delabreth, high constable of France; Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France; the master of the crossbows, Lord Rambures; Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin, John duke of Alençon, Anthony duke of Brabant, the brother of the duke of Burgundy, and Edward duke of Bar. Of brave earls, Grandpré and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale. Here was a 
royal fellowship of death! Where is the number of our English dead? 
##The HERALD shows him another aper.
Edward the duke of York, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire. No one else of name, and only twenty-five other men. Oh, God, your power was with us. What happened here is your doing alone, not ours. When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other, in the ordinary and equal clash of battle? Take credit, God, for it is no one’s doing but yours. 
###EXETER
It’s unbelievable. 
###KING HENRY
Come, let’s make a solemn procession to the village. And let it be proclaimed throughout our army that it shall be a hanging offense for anyone to boast of this or take from God the credit that belongs to Him alone. 
###FLUELLEN
If it pleases your Majesty, isn’t it permissible to mention the number of casualties? 
###KING HENRY
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement—that God fought for us. 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, I truly think He did great good. 
###KING HENRY
We’ll perform all the holy rites. Let Non nobis and Te Deum be sung, and let the dead be buried properly. Then on to Calais and from there to England. There have never been more fortunate men than we to return from France. 
##They all exit.
##The CHORUS enters.
###CHORUS
Allow me to fill in the gaps for those of you who have not read this story. As for those who have, I beg you to excuse the gaps in time, and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form. Let’s bring the king now to Calais. Imagine him there and, having seen him there, haul him back across the sea on the wings of your imagination. There’s the coast of England: see how the sea seems to be fenced in by the men and wives and boys who line the shore, their shouts and wild applause drowning out the deep roar of the surf. As the king’s ship draws near, the very ocean is like a man running before the king, preparing his way. Let’s have him land and solemnly proceed to London. Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city. He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God. Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets. Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar. Imagine if our own queen’s general returned from Ireland, having stamped out the rebellion there, as we hope he does very soon, how many people would leave the city to come welcome him. Even more people than that welcomed Harry home, 
and they had even more reason. Let’s put him now in London, since France’s period of mourning requires the king of England to stay home. Imagine a visit of the Holy Roman Emperor, working on France’s behalf. He wants to bring about a peace between the two countries. Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France. There we must place him, and I myself have covered the interim period by reminding you that it has taken place. So, keeping this omission in mind, immediately return to France, your eyes following the path of your thoughts. 
##The CHORUS exits.
## FLUELLEN and GOWER enter.
###GOWER
Yes, that’s true, but why are you wearing your leek today? Saint Davy’s Day has passed. 
###FLUELLEN
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything. I’ll tell you as my friend, Captain Gower: that rascally, mean, beggarly, lousy, bragging Pistol, whom you and yourself and all the world know to be no better than a peasant—see—with no good qualities at all: he came to me yesterday and brought me bread and salt and told me to eat my leek. We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him, but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind. 
## PISTOL enters.
###GOWER
And here he comes, puffing himself up like a turkey. 
###FLUELLEN
Never mind his puffings and his turkeys. God bless you, Ensign Pistol! You lousy, rotten, villain, God bless you! 
###PISTOL
Are you mad? Do you want me to cut your life short, you deceiving lowlife? Away! The smell of leek turns my stomach. 
###FLUELLEN
I wonder if you’d be so good, you lousy, rotten villain, to grant my wish and my request and gratify me, see, by eating this leek. I’d like you to, see, because you don’t like it, and because it isn’t to your taste, and because it doesn’t agree with you. 
###PISTOL
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats. 
###FLUELLEN
Here’s a goat for you. (strikes him with a club) Will you be good enough to eat it, mangy rascal? 
###PISTOL
Dissolute lowlife, you shall die. 
###FLUELLEN
That’s very true, mangy rascal, when it pleases God. Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food. Come, here’s some sauce to go with it. (strikes him with his club) Yesterday you called me “mountain squire.” Today I’ll make you squire of the low ground. Go on, eat up. If you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek. 
###GOWER
Enough, Captain. You’ve stunned him. 
###FLUELLEN
I tell you, I’ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing.—Go on, bite. It’s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin. 
###PISTOL
Must I bite? 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, absolutely, no question or ambiguity about it. 
###PISTOL
By this leek, I swear I’ll make you pay for this. (FLUELLEN threatens to strike him) Okay, okay, I’m eating it— 
###FLUELLEN
Please do. Would you like some more sauce to go with it? There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on. 
###PISTOL
Lay off, already! Can’t you see I’m eating? 
###FLUELLEN
I sincerely hope it does you good, mangy rascal. No, don’t throw any of it away. The skin is good for your cracked head. When you see leeks in the future, I hope you keep mocking them. That’s all. 
###PISTOL
Good. 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, leeks are good. Wait, here’s a penny to heal your head. 
###PISTOL
Me, a penny? 
###FLUELLEN
Yes, and you’ll take it. If not, I have another leek in my pocket that you can eat. 
###PISTOL
I’ll take this penny as a token that you’ll pay for this. 
###FLUELLEN
If I owe you anything, I’ll pay you in clubbings. You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me. God be with you and keep you, and may he heal your head. 
##He exits.
###PISTOL
There’ll be hell to pay for this. 
###GOWER
Go on, get out of here. You’re a lying, cowardly wretch. You mock an ancient tradition, born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died, and then have the gall not to stand by your words. I’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once. You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club. You’ve learned otherwise. Let this be a Welsh lesson to you to behave with English manners in the future. Farewell. 
##He exits.
###PISTOL
Has Fortune turned on me, like the whore she is? I’ve had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice. There went my last refuge. I grow old, and all dignity has been thrashed out of me. Well, I’ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing. I’ll steal away to England, and I’ll steal some more when I get there. I’ll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars. 
##He exits.
##Through one door KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and other lords enter. Through another door, the FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the princess KATHERINE, ALICE, and other ladies enter with the DUKE OF BURGUNDY and his train.
###KING HENRY
Peace to this occasion that’s brought us all together. Health and good day to our brother the king of France and to our sister the queen. Joy and good wishes to our lovely royal cousin, Katherine. And you, Duke of Burgundy, who brought this great assembly together, we salute you as descendent and member of this royal family. And a health to all you lords and princes of France. 
###KING OF FRANCE
We rejoice to see you, most worthy brother of England. You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes. 
###QUEEN ISABEL
Brother of England, may this meeting prove as fruitful as it is joyous. We are glad to look upon your face—a face whose eyes have until now carried in them a glance as deadly, for any Frenchman they alighted on, as the poisonous eyes of those mythical lizards, the basilisks. We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship. 
###KING HENRY
We’re here to say “amen” to that. 
###QUEEN ISABEL
All you English princes, I salute you. 
###BURGUNDY
Great kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty. Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties. Since I have succeeded to the point of bringing you face to face and eye to eye, don’t take it ill if I formally demand to know, before this royal congregation, what obstacle or impediment prevents the poor fragile, mangled peace, the mother of arts and joyous births, from showing her lovely face in this most fertile garden of the world, our fair France? Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness. Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines. Her once-trimmed hedges, like prisoners with wild, untended hair, put forth unruly twigs. Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting. The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs. And just as our vineyards, fallow fields, meadows, and hedges, which grow improperly if left to themselves, run riot, so our families and ourselves and our 
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country. They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural. It’s to reverse all this, so we can once again become as we were, that you have all been brought together; therefore I demand to know why gentle peace should not banish these troubles and bless us with her former qualities. 
###KING HENRY
Duke of Burgundy, if you want peace, the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe, you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands. You hold the details and particulars of our terms, briefly enumerated, before you in your hands. 
###BURGUNDY
The king has heard them, but as yet has made no answer. 
###KING HENRY
Well, the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer. 
###KING OF FRANCE
I’ve only given the articles a cursory glance. If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully, I will give my answer and acceptance right away. 
###KING HENRY
Brother, I shall. Go, uncle Exeter, and brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester, Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king. You have full power to confirm, change, or add to any of my demands in any 
way that you judge advantageous to my rule, and I’ll undertake to agree to it. Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me? 
###QUEEN ISABEL
Gracious brother, I will go with them. Perhaps a woman’s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up. 
###KING HENRY
In that case, leave our cousin Katherine here with us. She is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty. 
###QUEEN ISABEL
She is welcome to stay. 
##Everyone except KING HENRY, KATHERINE, and ALICE exits.
###KING HENRY
Lovely, most lovely Katherine, will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours? 
###KATHERINE
Your Majesty shall mock at me. I cannot speak your England. 
###KING HENRY
Lovely Katherine, if you will love me well with your French heart, I’m happy to hear you confess it in broken English. Do you like me, Kate? 
###KATHERINE
Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me.” 
###KING HENRY
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel. 
###KATHERINE
(to ALICE, in French) What does he say? That I am like an angel? 
###ALICE
(in French) Yes, your Grace, that’s what he says. 
###KING HENRY
I said so, dear Katherine, and I’m not ashamed to repeat it. 
###KATHERINE
(in French) Oh, Lord! The tongues of men are full of deceit. 
###KING HENRY
(to ALICE) What does she say, pretty one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits? 
###ALICE
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits: dere’s de princess for you. 
###KING HENRY
How very English of her. Kate, my wooing is fit for your understanding: I am glad your English isn’t better. If it were, you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown. I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over. So give me your answer, and we’ll shake on it. Deal? 
###KATHERINE
With all due respect, me understand well. 
###KING HENRY
Really, if you were thinking of having me write poetry or dance for you, Kate, you’ve defeated me already. I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength. If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife. I can fight with my fists and rear my horse up without falling off him, if either of those things could win me love. But, 
before God, Kate, I cannot turn pale on purpose or gasp out fancy phrases, and I have no gift for clever declarations, only blunt oaths, which I never use till I’m asked and never break no matter who asks me. If you can love a man of this temperament, Kate, whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself, let your eye improve me. I speak to you as a plain soldier. If you can love me for this, take me. If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God. And yet I do love you. So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness. He’s bound to be true to you as he won’t be up to flirting with other women. These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again. Look, a talker is just a gabber; a poem is just a rhyme. A good leg will shrink, a straight back stoop, a black beard turn white, a curly head grow bald, an attractive face grow wrinkled and a pretty eye hollow. But a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or, rather, the sun, and not the moon, for it goes on shining brightly forever. If you would have such a man, take me. Take me and get a soldier; take a soldier and get a king. So what do you say to my suit? Speak, my fair one, and speak fairly, I beg you. 
###KATHERINE
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France? 
###KING HENRY
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate. But in loving me, you would love the friend of France, for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it. I will have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then France is yours and you are mine. 
###KATHERINE
I don’t understand all dat. 
###KING HENRY
No, Kate? I will tell you in French, which I am sure will hang as heavily on my tongue as a newly married wife around her husband’s neck, impossible to shake off. (in stilted French) I, when, on the possession of France, and when you have the possession of me—(in English) let me see, what then? help me, Saint Denis!—(French again) then yours is France and you are mine. (in English) It would be as easy for me to reconquer the kingdom, Kate, as it would be for me to speak that much French again. I’ll never move you in French, except to laugh at me. 
###KATHERINE
Your French, sir, is better than my English. 
###KING HENRY
No, really, it’s not, Kate. But your speaking my language, and I yours truly-falsely comes to pretty much the same thing. Can you understand this much English though, Kate? Could you love me? 
###KATHERINE
I cannot tell. 
###KING HENRY
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I’ll ask them. Come, I know you love me. And at night, when you go to your bedroom, you’ll question this gentlewoman about me and, I know, Kate, you’ll criticize those qualities of mine that you secretly love. But mock me gently, dear Kate, because I love you terribly. If I ever win you, Kate, as I have an inkling I will, it won’t be without a skirmish—and that suggests you’d make a good mother of soldiers. Shall not you and I together, then, between Saint Denis and Saint George, make a boy, half French, half English, who will go to Constantinople 
and grab the Turk by the beard? Shall we not? What do you say, my fair fleur-de-lys? 
###KATHERINE
I do not know dat. 
###KING HENRY
No, of course you don’t. It lies in the future, along with certainty. Now there can only be the promise. Do promise, Kate, that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy; and for my English half, take the word of a king and a bachelor. What’s your answer, (speaking in French) oh loveliest of Katherines, my most precious and divine goddess? 
###KATHERINE
Your Majesty has false French enough to deceive de wisest lady in France. 
###KING HENRY
Damn my false French. I tell you truly, in true English: I love you, Kate. And though I wouldn’t dare to swear that you love me, still my blood begins to flatter me that you do, despite the ill effects of my face. Curse my father’s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he conceived me, and consequently my outward appearance is harsh and steely. I intimidate ladies when I come to woo them. But I promise you, Kate: the older I grow the better I’ll look. My comfort is that old age, that poor preserver of beauty, can’t make my face any worse than it already is. If you have me, you have me now at my worst; and if you have me, you’ll appreciate me better and better. Therefore tell me, fairest Katherine, will you have me? Put aside your maiden blushes and speak your true feelings with the bearing of an empress. Take me by the hand and say, “Harry of England, I am yours.” No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out, “England is yours, Ireland is yours, France is yours, and Harry Plantagenet 
is yours.” And, though I say so in his presence, if he’s not a friend of the best kings, you’ll find him king of the best friends. Come on, tell me in broken music—for your voice is music and your English broken. Come, Katherine Queen of All, reveal your heart to me in broken English. Will you have me? 
###KATHERINE
Dat is as it shall please de king my father. 
###KING HENRY
Oh, it will please him, Kate. It will please him very well. 
###KATHERINE
Den it shall also content me. 
###KING HENRY
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen. 
###KATHERINE
(in French) No, sir! Stop, stop! Heavens, I can’t allow you to lower yourself by kissing the hand of one of your humble servants. I hope you’ll pardon me, mighty king. 
###KING HENRY
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate. 
###KATHERINE
(in French) It is not the custom for French maidens to kiss before they are married. 
###KING HENRY
What does she say, madam interpreter? 
###ALICE
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish. 
###KING HENRY
To kiss. 
###ALICE
Your Majesty understand bettre den me. 
###KING HENRY
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, is that what she says? 
###ALICE
Yes, exactly. 
###KING HENRY
Oh, Kate, prudish customs bow before great kings. You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs, dear Kate. You and I, Kate, we are the makers of custom, and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize, as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss. Therefore, willingly and yielding. (kisses her) You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence in a sweet touch of them than in the tongues of the whole French council. They would persuade Harry of England sooner than a whole assembly of monarchs. Here comes your father. 
##The FRENCH KING and QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other LORDS enter.
###BURGUNDY
God save your Majesty. My royal kinsman, are you teaching our princess English? 
###KING HENRY
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her, kinsman, and that’s good English. 
###BURGUNDY
She picks it up quick, doesn’t she? 
###KING HENRY
Our language is rough, friend, and it’s not in my nature to speak smoothly. So, possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery, I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness. 
###BURGUNDY
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic. For love to appear in his true likeness, he would have to be as Cupid is: naked and blind. How can you blame her, a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes, for objecting to having a blind, naked boy appear before her? It’s a lot to ask of a maiden. 
###KING HENRY
But virgins close their eyes and submit all the time, and blind love has his way. 
###BURGUNDY
They’re forgiven, then, if they don’t see what they’re doing. 
###KING HENRY
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes, my lord. 
###BURGUNDY
I will signal her with a wink to consent, my lord, if you will teach her what that means. Maidens who are well fed and well taken care of are like August flies, blind though they can see. They’ll let you handle them then, though they’d scarcely let you look at them before. 
###KING HENRY
So you’re telling me to give it time and wait for summer. And even then, in order for me to catch the fly your cousin, she must be blind? 
###BURGUNDY
Like love, my lord, before it learns to love. 
###KING HENRY
Fair enough. Some of you may, thank love for my blindness. There’s many a French town that I can’t see because one pretty French maid stands in front of me. 
###FRENCH KING
Oh yes, my lord, you see them, but you see them metaphorically. The cities appear to you like a maiden because virgin walls, which war has never invaded, surround them. 
###KING HENRY
Shall Kate be my wife? 
###FRENCH KING
If you wish. 
###KING HENRY
I am satisfied, as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her. That way, the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire. 
###FRENCH KING
We have consented to all reasonable terms. 
###KING HENRY
Is that true, my lords of England? 
###WESTMORELAND
The king has agreed to every point: first his daughter, then everything else, as you strictly proposed. 
###EXETER
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in French, Notre tres cher fils Henri, Roi d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and in Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex Angliae, et Haeres Franciae. 
###FRENCH KING
And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it. 
###KING HENRY
In that case, I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest, and bestow your daughter on me. 
###FRENCH KING
Take her, my son, and give me children by her, so that the warring kingdoms of France and England, whose very shores have paled in envy at each other’s happiness, may finally end their mutual hostility. May this 
precious marriage cause friendship and alliance between them and war never again threaten England or fair France with his bloody sword. 
###ALL
Amen. 
###KING HENRY
Now, welcome, Kate.—And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen. 
##Trumpets sound.
###QUEEN ISABEL
May God, who is the best matchmaker, join your hearts and realms in one. As man and wife, though two, are one in love, so let there be between your kingdoms such a marriage that neither wrongdoing nor fierce jealousy, which often trouble the sacred state of marriage, ever sever them. And let Englishmen be French and Frenchmen English. God say, “Amen”! 
###ALL
Amen! 
###KING HENRY
Let us prepare for our wedding.—On that day, I’ll take your oath of loyalty, my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers, to guarantee my treaty. Then I will swear to Kate and you to me, and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate. 
##Trumpets sound.
##They all exit.
##The CHORUS enters.
###CHORUS
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling. The lifespan of our English hero was brief, but in that brief time he achieved greatness. He had good luck as a warrior, and with it he created the world’s greatest garden, France, leaving his son as its imperial ruler. Henry the Sixth, crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy, succeeded him. But so many people had a hand in managing the child’s kingdom that France was lost and civil war came to England—a story we’ve acted out many times on this stage. With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly. 
##The CHORUS exits.

##The KING, Lord John of LANCASTER, the Earl of WESTMORELAND, and others enter.
###KING
Despite how shaken and pale with worry we are, let’s take advantage of this moment of peace to catch our breath, and as we pant we’ll speak about the battles we’ll soon fight in foreign lands. England will no longer be wet with her own people’s blood. War will no longer damage her fields, and warhorses will no longer trample her flowers. The soldiers on either side of this vicious civil war were countrymen and brothers, as similar to one another as shooting stars. They may have clashed recently, but now they will march together in beautiful formation, no longer struggling against family and friend. War is like a mishandled knife: it can cut its owner, but it will no longer cut us. My friends, we are now soldiers for Christ, and we take his blessed cross as our battle flag. We’ll raise a new army of Englishmen and march all the way to the Holy Land. Our soldiers were born to chase non-believers from that holy ground touched by Jesus' feet—feet which, fourteen hundred years ago, were nailed to the cross for our sins. 
But that’s been my plan for a year now, so there’s no point in telling you all this again. That’s not the issue at hand. So tell me, my noble kinsman Westmoreland, what my royal advisors decided last night about this important undertaking. 
###WESTMORELAND
Your Highness, there was hot debate about this urgent mission, and many responsibilities had just been assigned when we were suddenly cut off by a messenger with bad news from Wales. The worst of it was that the noble Mortimer, who was leading the men of Herefordshire in battle against that barbarian Glendower, was captured. A thousand of his men have been butchered, their dead corpses desecrated by the Welsh women. The things they did were so horrible that I’m too ashamed to report them. 
###KING
I suppose this news disrupts our plans to invade the Holy Land. 
###WESTMORELAND
This and other things, your Highness: even more unsettling and unwelcome news has arrived from the north. On Holy Cross Day, the heroic young Harry Percy—who we know as Hotspur—fought at Holmeden against Archibald, Earl of Douglas, that brave and battle-proven Scotsman. The two of them fought a long and bloody battle there, judging by the way the guns were firing. The messenger who brought the news left when the battle was at its height, so he couldn’t say for sure who had won. 
###KING
My loyal, hard-working friend Sir Walter Blunt has arrived here at court, fresh off his horse and covered with the mud of every town from Holmedon to here. He’s brought us very welcome news. The Earl of Douglas has been defeated. Blunt saw ten thousand Scotsmen and twenty-two knights piled up in their own blood on the fields of Holmedon. Hotspur took these men prisoner: Douglas' son Mordake, the Earl of Fife; as well as the Earls of Athol, Murray, Angus, and Menteith. That’s a valuable group! A fantastic catch, isn’t it, kinsman? 
###WESTMORELAND
Truly, that’s a conquest to make even a prince brag. 
###KING
Yes, and that makes me sad. Seeing Lord Northumberland with such a blessed son makes me commit the sin of envy. When honor speaks, it speaks about Hotspur. In a grove of trees, Hotspur stands straightest. He is the favorite darling of Fortune. When I see how he is praised, I can only see my own son, Harry, and his reputation for wildness and dishonor. If only it could be proven that a fairy had come to their cradles at night and switched them! Then the Percy family would have my Harry, and we Plantagenets would have Hotspur! But stop thinking about Harry now. Westmoreland, what do you make of young Percy’s arrogance? He says he’ll keep all the prisoners he captured for himself, and will only send me Mordrake, Earl of Fife. 
###WESTMORELAND
His uncle Worcester put him up to that. It is just like Worcester to act against you in all ways. He’s the one making Hotspur behave like this, flaunting his youth in the face of your dignified age. 
###KING
I’ve sent for Hotspur to explain himself. We’ll have to postpone the plans for our crusade to Jerusalem. Go tell my advisers that our next meeting will be Wednesday at Windsor. Then hurry back here. There’s more to be said and done, but I’m too angry now to speak. 
###WESTMORELAND
I will, my lord. 
##They exit.
## HENRY, PRINCE of Wales and Sir John FALSTAFF enter. 
###FALSTAFF
Hal, what time is it, my boy? 
###PRINCE HENRY
You are so wasted from drinking booze and loosening your pants after lunch and sleeping on benches all afternoon that you don’t even remember how to ask for what you really want to know. What the hell does it matter to you what time it is? Unless hours were glasses of wine, minutes were chickens, clocks were whores' tongues, sundials were whorehouse signs and the sun itself were a hot woman in a flame-colored dress, I don’t see any reason why you would need to know the time. 
###FALSTAFF
Now you’re talking, Hal. Thieves like us operate at night, by the moon and stars, and not by the sun. I hope, pretty boy, that when you become king, God save your Grace—or maybe I should just call you “Your Majesty,” since you don’t have any grace— 
###PRINCE HENRY
None? 
###FALSTAFF
No, I swear. Not even enough to say grace before a snack. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Come on, out with it. Get to the point. 
###FALSTAFF
Okay then, pretty boy. Whey you become king, don’t let those of us who work at night be blamed for wasting daylight by sleeping through it. Give us fancy names: “Servants of the Moon Goddess Diana;” “Gentlemen of Shadows;” “Lunar Laborers.” Make people admire us for being well behaved. After all, we’re governed by the same force that governs the tides—the pale and cool moon, who lights our way as we sneak around. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well said. And you’re right—our luck ebbs and flows like the tide, because, like the sea, we’re governed by the moon. I’ll prove it. Imagine a bag of gold, brilliantly swiped on a Monday night and extravagantly spent on a Tuesday morning. You snatch it, shouting, “Hand it off!” and spend it, calling, “Bring it on!” It’s like the gallows: one minute you’re at the bottom of the ladder—low tide. The next, you’re swinging from the top—high tide! 
###FALSTAFF
By God that’s right, my boy! And by the way, isn’t the hostess of the tavern a delicious woman? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Sweet as honey from Hybla, you dirty old man. And isn’t a sheriff’s uniform a pretty durable outfit? 
###FALSTAFF
What’s that supposed to mean, you crazy man? You’re in the mood for jokes? Why are you talking to me about a sheriff’s uniform? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well, why the hell are you asking me about the hostess of the tavern? 
###FALSTAFF
You’ve asked her for the bill enough times. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Did I ever ask you to pay for any of it? 
###FALSTAFF
No. I’ve got to admit, you’ve settled with her all by yourself. 
###PRINCE HENRY
And not just with her, but wherever my cash was good. And when I ran out, I switched to credit. 
###FALSTAFF
And you’ve stretched that so far that if it weren’t “here apparent” that you’re the “heir apparent,” your credit wouldn’t be worth a thing. But listen, pretty boy. Will England still have hangmen when you’re king? And will a thief’s courage still be thwarted by that nasty old clown, the law? When you’re king, don’t hang thieves. 
###PRINCE HENRY
No. You will. 
###FALSTAFF
I will? Excellent! By God, I’ll be a great judge. 
###PRINCE HENRY
You’ve judged wrong already. I mean, you’ll be in charge of hanging thieves, and become a superb hangman. 
###FALSTAFF
All right, Hal. I’ll tell you this: in a way, being a hangman agrees with me just as well as hanging around the court. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Waiting to get your suits granted? 
###FALSTAFF
Exactly. I’ve got plenty of those, just like the hangman has plenty of suits—the suits he takes off the dead men he hangs.—Damn, I’m as depressed as a tomcat or a dancing bear in chains. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Or an old lion, or a guitar playing a sad lovesong. 
###FALSTAFF
Or the wailing of a bagpipe. 
###PRINCE HENRY
How about a rabbit, or a trip to Moorditch? 
###FALSTAFF
You have a knack for foul images. You are the most metaphorical and rascally, sweet young Prince. But Hal, please stop corrupting me with frivolous matters. I wish to God that you and I knew where we could buy a supply of good reputations. The other day, an elderly lord on the King’s Council came up to me in the street and lectured me about you, but I didn’t pay any attention. He spoke wisely, but I ignored him. But he made sense, and in the street, too. 
###PRINCE HENRY
You did well. You know the scripture: “Wisdom cries out in the street but no man listens.” 
###FALSTAFF
Oh, you have a wicked talent for wrongly quoting scripture, you really could corrupt a saint. You’ve deeply harmed me, Hal, and God forgive you for it! Before I met you, I was innocent. And now, if I can speak truly, I’m no better than a sinner. I’ve got to change my life, and I will change my life, by God. If I don’t, I’m an evildoer. I won’t be damned, not for any king’s son in the universe. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Where should we go stealing tomorrow, Jack? 
###FALSTAFF
For God’s sake, wherever you want, boy. I’ll be one of the gang. If I’m not, call me evildoer and string me up. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I see you’ve changed your life, alright. From praying to pursesnatching. 
###FALSTAFF
It’s my calling, Hal. It’s no sin for a man to follow his calling. 
## POINS enters.
Poins! Now we’ll find out whether Mr. Gadshill has planned a robbery. If good deeds bring a man to heaven, there’s no hell hot enough for Poins. This is the most incredible villain, whoever said “Stick 'em up!” to an honest man. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Morning, Ned. 
###POINS
Morning, sweet Hal. What’s Mr. Feelbad got to say? What’s going on, Sir John, Wino Jack? How’s your deal with the devil coming along? You sold him your soul last Good Friday for some cold chicken and a glass of cheap wine, right? 
###PRINCE HENRY
The devil will get what’s coming to him. Sir John’s a man of his word, and he never disagrees with a proverb. He will “give the devil his due.” 
###POINS
(to FALSTAFF )Then you’re damned for keeping your word with the devil. 
###PRINCE HENRY
His only other choice is to be damned for cheating the devil. 
###POINS
But boys, boys! Four o'clock tomorrow morning some pilgrims are going to pass by Gad’s Hill. They’ll be on their way to Canterbury Cathedral with expensive offerings, and traders will be heading to London with bags of money. I’ve got masks for you, you’ve got horses for yourselves. Mr. Gadshill is spending tonight in Rochester, and I’ve already ordered tomorrow night’s dinner in Eastcheap. We could do this in our sleep. If you come, I’ll make you rich. If not, stay home and hang yourselves. 
###FALSTAFF
Listen, Yedward. If I stay home and don’t go, I’ll hang you — for going. 
###POINS
You will, fatface? 
###FALSTAFF
Hal, are you in? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Who? Me, a robber? Me, a thief? Not me. No way. 
###FALSTAFF
If you don’t dare to fight for ten shillings, there’s no honesty, manhood, or friendship in you, and you never came from royal blood. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well, okay. For once in my life, I’ll be a little crazy. 
###FALSTAFF
There you go. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well, you know what? I’ll stay home. 
###FALSTAFF
By God, then I’ll be a traitor when you become king. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I don’t care. 
###POINS
Sir John, do me a favor: leave me and the Prince alone. I’ll spell out such good reasons for this adventure, he’s sure to join. 
###FALSTAFF
May God give you the power of persuasion and him the good sense to listen, so that what you say will affect him and what he hears will sink in. This way, the true prince will turn into false thief, just for laughs. After all, all the poor, little vices of the age need encouragement. So long; you’ll find me in Eastcheap. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Farewell, you second spring! Farewell, you summer-in-November! 
## FALSTAFF exits.
###POINS
Now, my good sweet honey sir, come with us tomorrow. I have an idea for a practical joke, and I can’t do it by myself. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph, and Mr. Gadshill will rob the travelers we’re planning to ambush, but you and I won’t be there. If you and I don’t rob them once they have the loot, then chop off my head! 
###PRINCE HENRY
But we’re all planning to leave together. How will you and I separate ourselves? 
###POINS
We’ll leave before them, or after them. We’ll tell them to meet us someplace, but then we won’t show up. They’ll pull off the robbery by themselves, and the second they’ve done it, we’ll attack them. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Sure, but they’ll recognize our horses, our clothes, and all our other things. 
###POINS
Psh! They won’t see our horses, because I’ll tie them in the forest. We’ll put on new masks after we leave them. And, just for this occasion, I’ve made cloaks out of rough buckram cloth, to cover our regular clothes. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Okay. But I’m afraid they’ll be too tough for us. 
###POINS
Well, I know that two of them are the biggest cowards who ever turned and ran. As for the third, if he fights even a second longer than is absolutely necessary, I promise to never fight again. The best part about this joke will be listening to the outlandish lies this fat clown will tell when we meet for dinner—how he fought at least thirty men, how he defended himself, how he got hit, what he endured. The funniest part will be when we call him on it. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Okay. I’ll go. Get everything together and meet me in Eastcheap tomorrow. I’ll eat there. Farewell. 
###POINS
Farewell, my lord. 
## POINS exits.
###PRINCE HENRY
I understand all of you. For now, I’ll put on the rowdy behavior of your good-for-nothing ways. But in this way, I’ll be like the sun, who allows the vulgar, corrupting clouds to hide his beauty from the world. Then, when the sun wants to be himself again, he breaks through the foul mists and vapors that seemed to be strangling him. 
And because people have missed him so much, they are that much more impressed when he finally appears. If every day were a vacation, playing would grow as tedious as working. But when it’s rare, it’s looked forward to. Nothing is as precious as the unexpected occurrence. So when I throw off this wild behavior and accept the responsibilities of being king—a destiny I didn’t choose but was born into—I’ll suddenly seem like a far better man. In this way, I’ll give everyone the wrong expectation of me. Like a bright metal on a dark background, my reformation will shine even more brilliantly when it’s set against my wicked past. I’ll be so wild, I’ll make wildness an art form, then redeem myself when the world least expects me to. 
##He exits.
##The KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, Sir Walter BLUNT and others enter.
###KING
I’ve been too calm and even-tempered, unwilling to react angrily to these indignities. You have discovered this, and so you’ve walked all over my patience. Know this: from now on, I’m going to be my royal self again, powerful and frightening. My natural condition, which was as smooth as oil and soft as feathers, has lost me the respect that powerful people only pay to the similarly powerful. 
###WORCESTER
My lord, the Percy family does not deserve to bear the brunt of your anger and power, especially since we helped you become so powerful in the first place. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Your Highness — 
###KING
Worcester, get out. I see danger and disobedience in your eyes. You carry yourself too boldly and proudly, and royalty should never have to endure a servant’s frowning face. You have my permission to leave now. When I need you or your advice, I’ll call for you. 
## WORCESTER exits.
(to NORTHUMBERLAND)You were about to speak. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Yes, my Lord. The prisoners you asked for, which my son Harry Percy captured at Holmedon, were not kept from you in anger. He’s already told you that. Whoever told you my son meant to defy you was either mistaken or trying to make trouble. He’s done nothing wrong. 
###HOTSPUR
Sir, I didn’t hold back any prisoners. But I remember this: when the battle ended, I was exhausted with rage and exertion. I was out of breath, dizzy and bent over. All of a sudden a man approached me, neat, clean, and tidily dressed, like a bridegroom. His beard was freshly shaven, like a newly plowed field. He wore fancy cologne and he carried a perfume box, which he kept raising to his nose as he smiled and talked on. Whenever soldiers walked past, bearing dead bodies, he called them rude hoodlums for bringing a foul, disgusting corpse within breathing distance of him. He interrogated me, with his fancy language, and demanded that I give him my prisoners, to be taken on your behalf. There I was, with the cold aggravating all my wounds, being pestered by this idiot. In my grief and impatience, I gave him some kind of answer. I don’t even remember what I said—he could take them, or he couldn’t. 
I was so angry, looking at him all shiny and sweet-smelling, and speaking like a squeamish woman about guns and battle drums and wounds—God almighty! —and telling me the best thing for an injury is parmaceti, and that it was a shame that the blameless earth had to be dug up to find saltpeter for the gunpowder, when so many good, brave men had been cowardly destroyed by guns, and that if it hadn’t been for those disgusting guns, he would have been a soldier himself. All this trivial, incoherent talk I answered offhandedly, as I’ve already told you. So I beg you: please don’t take his word as evidence that there’s anything wrong between you and me, your Majesty. 
###BLUNT
Given the circumstances, my lord, whatever Harry Percy may have said to a man like that, in a place and time like that, should be allowed to die and never be spoken of again. It should never be used against Harry in any way, since he has taken it all back now. 
###KING
But he still won’t turn over his prisoners unless he can add these stipulations and exceptions. He wants me, at my own cost, to pay ransom for his brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer, a man who, on my life, willfully betrayed his own men, whom he had led in fighting against that great magician, the damned Glendower. And now we hear that Mortimer has married Glendower’s daughter! Should the treasury be emptied to ransom a traitor? Should I pay for treason, and bargain for a coward, when it was Mortimer who lost himself? No. Let him starve in the wilderness. No man who asks me to spend one penny on that traitor Mortimer can ever be a friend of mine. 
###HOTSPUR
“That traitor Mortimer!” He never faltered, my lord, except through an accident of war. I’ll prove it, by speaking about the many wounds he heroically suffered when he spent an hour in brutal hand-to-hand combat against Glendower on the grassy banks of the Severn River. They broke three times from fighting, and they drank three times from the Severn. The river itself was frightened by their horrible looks. Its water became discolored with the blood of these brave fighters, and the Severn ran off, as if to hide itself in the weeds on its banks. Treachery has never used deadly wounds to cover its operations, and Mortimer could never have willingly suffered so many injuries. Do not let him be slandered by calling him a traitor. 
###KING
You speak wrongly about him, Percy, you speak wrongly! He never fought Glendower. I tell you, he would just as soon dare to meet the devil himself as fight Glendower. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Don’t ever let me hear you speak of Mortimer again. Send me your prisoners as quickly as possible, or you’ll hear about it from me, and you won’t like what I have to say. Northumberland, I give you and your son permission to leave now. 
Send your prisoners, or you’ll hear about it. 
## KING Henry, BLUNT, and the attendants exit.
###HOTSPUR
Even if the devil himself comes screaming for them, I won’t send those prisoners. I’m going to go after him and tell him so; it will ease my heart, though it might cost me my head. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
What, drunk with anger? Wait a minute. Here comes your uncle. 
## WORCESTER enters.
###HOTSPUR
Talk about Mortimer? God damn, I will talk about him. And damn my soul if I don’t join him! I’ll empty out my veins for him, and I’ll pour my precious blood onto the ground, drop by drop! And I’ll lift this put-upon Mortimer as high up as this ungrateful King, this ungenerous, rotten Bolingbroke! 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
(toWORCESTER ) Brother, the King’s driven your nephew crazy. 
###WORCESTER
Who started this trouble after I left? 
###HOTSPUR
He wants all my prisoners, for God’s sake! And when I asked again for him to ransom my brother-in-law, he looked pale, and he shot me a look that could kill. Just the mention of Mortimer’s name makes him shake. 
###WORCESTER
I don’t blame him. Didn’t the late King Richard II proclaim that Mortimer should be next in line for the throne? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
He did; I heard the proclamation. That was when the wretched King Richard (may God forgive us for wronging him!) set out to invade Ireland. When that was interrupted, he returned to England, only to be deposed and then murdered. 
###WORCESTER
And for our part in his death, the whole world is scandalized by us, and speaks ill of us. 
###HOTSPUR
Stop a moment, please. Did King Richard really proclaim that my brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer was next in line for the throne? 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
He did. I heard it myself. 
###HOTSPUR
Then I can’t blame King Henry for wishing for him to starve in the wilderness. But is it right that you—who put the crown on Henry’s forgetful head, and who carry the accusations of murder for Henry’s sake—should be the target of the world’s curses? When you were only accomplices and instruments? Is it right to blame the ropes, the ladder, or the hangman for a man’s death? Forgive me for mentioning that you two are like those sordid objects, having been exploited by this conniving King. But will you stand by while people today speak of your shame? 
While history books record that men of your nobility and power dedicated themselves to as unjust a cause (which, God forgive you, you both did) as the overthrowing of Richard, that sweet lovely rose, and the planting of this thorn, this weed, Bolingbroke in Richard’s place? Will you listen as people say that you are fools, and that you’ve been tossed away by the very person you shamed yourselves to help? No. There is still time for you to redeem your reputations and restore your good names in the eyes of the world. Take revenge against this King who mocks and scorns you. He thinks constantly about how to repay you for all you did—by putting you to death. So I say— 
###WORCESTER
Quiet, nephew; don’t say any more. I have a secret for you, which is hidden like a book with a lock. I will open the book and read you a dark, dangerous story that will appeal to your righteous anger. It’s full of peril and adventure, as risky as walking across a churning, thundering river while balanced unsteadily on a spear. 
###HOTSPUR
If he falls in, then it’s all over, whether he sinks or swims. The honor of the struggle is all that counts, no matter what the danger is or where it comes from. It takes more courage to wake a sleeping lion than to frighten a rabbit! 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Dreaming about this heroic exploit is driving him past his patience. 
###HOTSPUR
By God, I think it would be easy to jump up and grab honor off of the moon’s pale face, or to dive into the deepest ocean and pull up honor by its hair. Then the man who rescues honor can wear her glory alone, without rivals. To hell with sharing the glory! 
###WORCESTER
(to NORTHUMBERLAND) He sees a world built by his imagination, but that world is not the one he should be paying attention to. (to HOTSPUR) Nephew, listen to me a minute. 
###HOTSPUR
I beg your pardon. 
###WORCESTER
These Scotsmen that you’ve taken prisoner — 
###HOTSPUR
I’ll keep them all. By God, the King won’t get a single Scot, even if having a Scot would save his soul! I’ll keep them, I swear. 
###WORCESTER
You’re off again and not listening to me. You will get to keep the prisoners — 
###HOTSPUR
Yes, I will; there’s no doubt about it. The King said he would not pay ransom for Mortimer. He forbid me from speaking of Mortimer. But I’ll find him when he’s sleeping, and I’ll shout “Mortimer!” into his ears. No; I’ll get a bird and teach it to say nothing but “Mortimer,” and I’ll give it to the King to anger him forever. 
###WORCESTER
Listen, nephew, please. 
###HOTSPUR
From now on, all other pursuits I’ll cast aside, except for scheming how to aggravate this Bolingbroke and his son, the lowlife Prince of Wales. If it weren’t for the fact that I suspect Henry doesn’t love his son, and that he’d be glad to see misfortune befall him, I’d poison the Prince’s ale. 
###WORCESTER
Goodbye, nephew. I’ll talk to you when you’re in a better mood to listen. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
(to HOTSPUR)You are an impatient and short-tempered fool to start nattering on like a woman, not listening to any voice but your own! 
###HOTSPUR
Listen, I feel like I’m being whipped with sticks and stung by ants when I hear about this vile politician, Bolingbroke. When Richard was alive—what is that place called? Damn, it’s in Gloucestershire; it’s where that crazy duke’s uncle lived, his uncle York. It’s where I first met this lying Bolingbroke, and bowed to him.—Shoot!—It happened when you and Bolingbroke came back from Ravenspurgh. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
At Berkley castle. 
###HOTSPUR
Right. What great courtesy that flattering dog paid me! “The promise of his childhood has come true,” he said. “Gentle Harry Percy,” he called me, and “kind kinsman.” To hell with liars like him! — I’m sorry. Uncle, go on. I’m done. 
###WORCESTER
No, if you’re not done yet, keep going. We’ll wait until you’re ready. 
###HOTSPUR
I’m done. I swear. 
###WORCESTER
Then go back to your Scottish prisoners. Release them at once, without ransom. Make friends with Douglas, and use his influence to gather an army in Scotland. He’ll gladly help you for many reasons, which I’ll write you about soon. (to NORTHUMBERLAND) Now you, sir. While your son is busy in Scotland, you will strike up a close alliance with the Archbishop, that noble, well-beloved churchman. 
###HOTSPUR
He is the Archbishop of York, no? 
###WORCESTER
Yes, and he’s sorely upset about his brother, Lord Scroop, whom Bolingbroke put to death in Bristol. I’m not merely speculating; I’m telling you what I know for a fact has been considered, plotted, and set into motion. They’re only waiting now for the right moment to strike. 
###HOTSPUR
I get it. And it’s good, I bet my life on it! 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
Look, you’ve let your dogs slip off of their leashes before the hunt has even begun. 
###HOTSPUR
There’s no way this excellent plan won’t work. And the armies of Scotland and York will join with Mortimer, right? 
###WORCESTER
Yes, they will. 
###HOTSPUR
I swear, it’s extremely well thought out. 
###WORCESTER
And we’ve got good reasons to hurry and save ourselves by raising an army. No matter how hard we try to look like everything’s fine, the King will always think he owes us for having helped him take the throne, and he’ll worry that we don’t feel we’ve been properly compensated. Until he finds a way to pay us for good—by killing us. You can see that he’s already begun to distance himself from us. 
###HOTSPUR
He has, he has. We’ll get revenge! 
###WORCESTER
Nephew, farewell. Don’t do any more than I tell you to do in the letters I’ll write you. When the time comes, which will be soon, I’ll sneak off to Glendower and Mortimer. I’ll plan it so that you, Douglas and all our armies will arrive together. Then we can face our future with strength instead of the uncertainty we feel now. 
###NORTHUMBERLAND
So long, brother. I believe we’ll prevail. 
###HOTSPUR
Good bye, uncle. Oh, I hope it won’t be long until battlefields and collisions and groans are witnesses to our game of war! 
##They exit.
##FIRST CARRIERcarrier = deliverymanCARRIER enters, holding a lantern.
###FIRST CARRIER
I’ll be damned if it isn’t 4 A.M. already. The Big Dipper has already risen above the chimney, and our horses aren’t ready yet. Hey, ostler! 
###OSTLER
(offstage) Just a second! 
###FIRST CARRIER
Hey, Tom, give the saddle of my horse, Cut, a few whacks to soften it up, and stuff some wool under it—the old nag’s got some bad bruises on her shoulders. 
## SECOND CARRIER enters.
###SECOND CARRIER
The feed here’s as damp as anything. That’s a fast way for a horse to get parasites. This stable’s upside down since Ostler Robin died. 
###FIRST CARRIER
Poor guy. Once the price of oats went up, he was never happy again. It killed him. 
###SECOND CARRIER
This stable’s got worse fleas than any in London. I’m stung like a tench. 
###FIRST CARRIER
Like a tench? I’m telling you, not even a king could be bitten more than I’ve been bitten since midnight. 
###SECOND CARRIER
They don’t even give us a bathroom. So we pee in the fireplace, and you know that urine breeds fleas like nobody’s business. 
###FIRST CARRIER
Hey, ostler! Come on already, damn you! 
###SECOND CARRIER
I’ve got to deliver a ham and some ginger root all the way to Charing Cross. 
###FIRST CARRIER
God almighty! The turkeys I’m carrying are starving! Hey, Stable-boy! Curse you! Can’t you see? Can’t you hear? If it isn’t a good idea to knock you on the head, I’m a fool. Come on, damn you! Can’t we trust you to do your job? 
## GADSHILL enters.
###GADSHILL
Morning, deliverymen. What time is it? 
###FIRST CARRIER
I think it’s two o'clock. 
###GADSHILL
Let me borrow your lantern so I can check on my horse in the stable. 
###FIRST CARRIER
No way, by God; just hold on a minute. I know a few tricks like that myself, I swear. 
###GADSHILL
(to SECOND CARRIER) Please, let me borrow yours. 
###SECOND CARRIER
Sure, whenever. Whatever you say. “Let me borrow your lantern,” he says? Yeah, right. I’ll see you dead first. 
###GADSHILL
Sirrah, what time do you plan to be in London? 
###SECOND CARRIER
At a reasonable enough time. (to FIRST CARRIER) Come on, Mugs, old friend. Let’s wake up the gentlemen. They want to travel in a group because they’re carrying a lot of valuables. 
##Both CARRIERS exit.
###GADSHILL
Hey, chamberlain! 
###CHAMBERLAIN
(offstage) “I’m there for you,” as the pickpockets say! 
###GADSHILL
That’s as good as saying, “‚I’m there for you,' said the chamberlain.” You’re only as different from a pickpocket as a supervisor is from a worker; you’re the one who sets the plans. 
##The CHAMBERLAIN enters.
###CHAMBERLAIN
Morning, Mr. Gadshill. What I told you last night is still true. There’s a rich landowner all the way from Kent staying here, and he’s got three hundred gold coins with him. I heard him say so to a man at supper last night. That man’s some kind of tax collector, and he has plenty of money with him, too. They just woke up and they’ve ordered breakfast; they’ll be leaving soon. 
###GADSHILL
Sirrah, if they don’t run into some highway robbers today, you can have my neck. 
###CHAMBERLAIN
I don’t want it; keep it for the hangman. I know you worship the patron saint of highway robbery, as much as a godless man like you worships anything. 
###GADSHILL
Why are you taking to me about the hangman? If I hang, I’ll make half of a fat pair on the gallows, because if I hang, old Sir John will be hanging right with me—and he’s not exactly thin. Please! Our gang has some members you could never guess, and for their own amusement, they’re happy to lend the profession of thievery some respect. If we were ever investigated, they would smooth everything over. I’ve got no wandering highwaymen, no thieves with homemade weapons, no red-faced drunks with crazy mustaches. Only men of calm and noble demeanor for me: magistrates and court officials. Men who can keep a secret; who’d rather smack you than speak, rather speak than drink, and rather drink than pray.—No! That’s a lie! They pray all the time to England, their patron saint. Or rather, they don’t pray to her; they prey on her. They ride her up and down and then make her their boots. 
###CHAMBERLAIN
Make her their boots? Why, will she keep their feet dry from muddy water? 
###GADSHILL
She can, she can. She’s been greased with so many bribes that she’s waterproof. We thieve in complete safety; we’ve got a potion that makes us invisible. 
###CHAMBERLAIN
Oh, I don’t think so. It’s the dark of night that makes you hard to see, not a secret potion. 
###GADSHILL
Let’s shake hands. You’ll get a share of our spoils; I swear on my honor as a true man. 
###CHAMBERLAIN
I’d rather have you swear by your reputation as a dishonest thief. 
###GADSHILL
Whatever. I’m a true man, even if I’m a dishonest thief. Tell the stable-boy to get my horse. Farewell, you fool. 
##They exit.
## PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO, and BARDOLPH enter.
###POINS
Come on, hide, hide! I stole Falstaff’s horse, and he’s rubbed the wrong way; he’s fraying like cheap velvet. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Stay hidden. 
## POINS, PETO and BARDOLPH exit.
## FALSTAFF enters.
###FALSTAFF
Poins! Poins, damn you! Poins! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Quiet, you fat-bellied jerk! What a racket you’re making! 
###FALSTAFF
Where’s Poins, Hal? 
###PRINCE HENRY
He walked up the hill. I’ll go find him. 
## PRINCE HENRY exits.
###FALSTAFF
I got a raw deal, to be out robbing with him. He stole my horse and tied him up someplace. If I have to walk even four feet more, I’ll be totally out of breath. Still, I bet I’ll die a natural death—if I don’t get hanged for killing that jerk, that is. Every hour for the past twenty-two years, I’ve sworn I’d never talk to him again, but I love his company. He must have slipped me a love potion that makes me adore him. Damn, that must be it: I have drunk love potions. Poins! Hal! Drop dead, the both of you! Bardolph! Peto! I’ll die if I have to walk another foot. If turning honest and abandoning these jerks weren’t the best things I could possibly do for myself, then I’m the worst scoundrel that ever lived. Eight yards of rough road is like seventy miles to me, and these hard-hearted crooks know it. It stinks when there’s no honor among thieves. 
##They whistle from offstage.
Whew! 
## PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO, and BARDOLPHenter.
The hell with you all! Give me my horse, you deadbeats. Give me my horse and the hell with you! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Shut up, fatso! Lie down, put your ear to the ground, and listen for the footsteps of travelers. 
###FALSTAFF
Do you have a crane to lift me up again once I’m down? Damn, I wouldn’t walk my fat self this far again for all the money in your father’s treasury. What are you doing horsing around with me like this? 
###PRINCE HENRY
You’re lying. We can’t horse around, because you don’t have a horse. 
###FALSTAFF
Please, my good Hal, help me find my horse, you good king’s son. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Later with that! You want me to be your stable boy? 
###FALSTAFF
Go drop dead in your own heir-apparent pants. If I’m arrested, I’ll rat you out, too. If I don’t get them singing dirty songs in the street about you all, let me be poisoned to death with booze. I hate it when a practical joke gets so out of hand—and with me out of a horse, too! 
## GADSHILL enters.
###GADSHILL
Freeze! 
###FALSTAFF
I am, and I don’t like it. 
###POINS
Oh, that’s the man who planned the whole thing; I recognize his voice, Bardolph.— What’s going on? 
###GADSHILL
Cover your faces, cover your faces. Get your masks on. There’s tax money coming down the hill, on its way to the King’s treasury. 
###FALSTAFF
That’s a lie, you clown. It’s on its way to the king’s bank. 
###GADSHILL
There’s enough to make us all rich. 
###FALSTAFF
Or to get us all hanged. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Listen, you four confront them in the narrow lane. Ned Poins and I will wait further down. If they get away from you, they’ll run right into us. 
###PETO
How many of them are there? 
###GADSHILL
About eight or ten. 
###FALSTAFF
Damn! Won’t they rob us? 
###PRINCE HENRY
What, are you a coward, Sir John Fatstuff? 
###FALSTAFF
Well, I’m certainly not John of Gaunt, your grandfather, but I’m no coward, Hal. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well, we’ll see about that. 
###POINS
Jack, sirrah, your horse is there behind the hedge. When you need him, that’s where you’ll find him. So long, and be brave. 
###FALSTAFF
I can’t hit him. I’d be hanged. 
###PRINCE HENRY
(to POINS, so others cannot hear) Ned, where are our disguises? 
###POINS
(to PRINCE HENRY) They’re here, close by. Now hide. 
## PRINCE HENRY and POINS exit.
###FALSTAFF
Now, men, here’s to happy endings. Every man to his station. 
##The TRAVELERS enter.
###FIRST TRAVELER
Come on, friend. The boy will lead our horses down the hill while we walk a bit and stretch our legs. 
###THIEVES
Freeze! 
###TRAVELERS
Jesus bless us! 
###FALSTAFF
Hit them! Down with them! Cut their throats! Yahhhhh! No-good bloodsuckers! Overfed morons! They hate young people like us. Down with them! Rob them blind! 
###TRAVELERS
Oh! We’re done for! 
###FALSTAFF
Damn it, you potbellied morons, are you finished? No, you fat misers. I wish everything you owned were here. Come on, pigs, come on! What, you idiots! Young men have to survive. You’re Grand Jurors, aren’t you? Well here’s some justice for you! 
##The thieves rob the travelers and tie them up. They all exit.
## PRINCE HENRY and POINS enter.
###PRINCE HENRY
The thieves have tied up the honest men. If you and I can now rob the robbers and run laughing to London, we would talk about it for a week, laugh about it for a month, and it would be a hilarious story forever. 
###POINS
Get down. I hear them coming. 
## PRINCE HENRY and POINS hide. The THIEVES return.
###FALSTAFF
Come on, boys, let’s divide up the spoils and then ride off before dawn. If the Prince and Poins aren’t cowards, there’s no justice in the universe. Poins is about as brave as a duck. 
##As the thieves split the money, PRINCE HENRY and POINS attack them.
###PRINCE HENRY
(in disguise) Give us your money! 
###POINS
(in disguise) Crooks! 
##The thieves all run away. FALSTAFF fights for a moment, then runs away as well, leaving all of the money behind.
###PRINCE HENRY
Too easy. Now we ride off happily. The thieves have scattered, and they’re so terrified that they don’t even want to run into each other—they’ll each think that the other guy is an officer! Let’s go, Ned. Falstaff is sweating so hard that he’s watering the ground as he walks along. If I weren’t laughing so hard, I’d actually feel sorry for him. 
###POINS
How loud that fat rogue screamed! 
##They exit.
## HOTSPUR enters alone, reading a letter.
###HOTSPUR
“As for me, sir, I would be happy to be there because of the love I bear for your family.” He would be happy to be here. Well, why isn’t he, then? He says he loves my family, but he clearly loves his barn more than our house. I’ll read on. “Your plan is dangerous.” That’s true, and it’s also dangerous to catch a cold, to sleep, to drink. But I tell you, my lord fool, we shall pluck a flower of safety from this thorn of danger. “Your plan is dangerous; your allies untrustworthy; your timing poor; and your whole project too weak to counter so powerful an opponent.” Is that so? Is that so? I’ll say it once again: you are a stupid, cowardly dog, and a liar. What an idiot this is! By God, our plan is as good a plan as ever hatched, our allies loyal and firm. A good plan, good allies, and very promising; it’s an excellent plan, very good allies. What a yellowbellied fool this is! Why, the Archbishop of York approves of the plan, and how it’s progressing. Damn! If I were with this imbecile right now, I’d break his head open with his wife’s fan. Don’t we have my father? And my uncle, and me? Edmund Mortimer, York, and Owen Glendower? And besides, don’t we have Douglas? Haven’t they all sent me letters, promising to meet me with their armies by the ninth of next month? And aren’t some of them on their way already? What an unbelievable ass this is! Faithless! Ha! Just watch; he’ll run to the King in cold fear and spill our secrets. Oh, I could split myself in two and knock my own self senseless for unfolding this important plan to such a coward. To hell with him! Let him tell the King; we’re ready. I’ll set off tonight. 
##His wife, LADY PERCY, enters.
What is it, Kate? I must leave you in a few hours. 
###LADY PERCY
Oh, my good lord, why are you alone like this? What have I done to make my Harry banish me from his bed these past two weeks? Tell me, sweet husband, what has stolen your appetite, your desire, and your sleep? Why do you stare at the ground and jump in your skin when you are sitting alone? Where is the color in your cheeks? Why have you taken all your attention, which should be mine, and given it to this dark mood and terrible sadness? While you sleep so lightly, I’ve watched you and heard you mumble stories of war. I’ve heard you give commands to your horse. I’ve heard you yell, “Courage! To the field!” And you have talked of charges and retreats; of trenches, tents; of fences, ramparts, and walls; of all types of cannon; of prisoners' ransoms and of dead soldiers, and of all the movements of a violent battle. Your soul has also been at war and has disturbed you in your sleep. Beads of sweat have broken out on your forehead, like bubbles in a churning stream. And on your face I’ve seen strange expressions, like a man who’s gulping his breath at an awful, sudden command. Oh, what does all this mean? My lord is contemplating some serious matters, and if he doesn’t tell me about them, he surely doesn’t love me. 
###HOTSPUR
You there! 
##A SERVANT enters.
Has Gilliams left with my letters? 
###SERVANT
He has, my lord, an hour ago. 
###HOTSPUR
Did Butler bring those horses from the sheriff? 
###SERVANT
He brought one of them just now. 
###HOTSPUR
Which one? A brown one, right? With its ears clipped? 
###SERVANT
Yes, my lord. 
###HOTSPUR
That brown horse will be my throne. I’ll mount him in a second. Oh, “Hope is my Comfort!” Tell Butler to walk him out in the fields. 
##The SERVANT exits.
###LADY PERCY
Listen, my lord. 
###HOTSPUR
What is it, my lady? 
###LADY PERCY
What is it that’s got you so carried away? 
###HOTSPUR
My horse, my love. My horse. 
###LADY PERCY
Enough, you crazy fool! Not even a weasel is as hotheaded as you are. I swear, I’ll find out what you’re up to, Harry, I will. I fear that my brother, Mortimer, is making some kind of move over his claim to the throne, and has asked you to help. But if you go— 
###HOTSPUR
—such a long way on foot, I’ll be tired. 
###LADY PERCY
Stop it, you little parrot. Answer me straight. I swear, Harry, I’ll break your little finger if you don’t tell me everything, and the truth, too. 
###HOTSPUR
Get away from me, you nag! Love? I don’t love you. I don’t even care about you, Kate. This is no time for playing with dolls and jousting with kisses; we’ll have bloody noses and broken heads, and spread them around, too. For God’s sake, my horse! What, Kate? What do you want from me? 
###LADY PERCY
You don’t love me? Really, you don’t? Well, fine then; don’t love me. And since you don’t love me, I won’t love myself. You don’t love me? Seriously, tell me if you’re joking or if you mean it. 
###HOTSPUR
Will you see me off? Once I’m on my horse, I’ll swear I love you till the end of time. But listen here, Kate. From now on, I won’t have you asking me where I’m going, nor guessing why I’m doing what I’m doing. I must go where I must go. This is final: tonight I must leave you, sweet Kate. I know you are wise, but your wisdom doesn’t go further than your role as my wife. You may be able to keep a secret, but you’re still a woman; and yet no woman can keep secrets like you, because you cannot reveal what you don’t actually know. And that is as far as I will trust you, sweet Kate. 
###LADY PERCY
Oh really? That far? 
###HOTSPUR
Not an inch further. But listen here, Kate. Wherever I go, you will go too. I leave today, and tomorrow, you. Will this make you content, Kate? 
###LADY PERCY
It must. 
##They exit.
## PRINCE HENRY and POINS enter.
###PRINCE HENRY
Ned, come out of that airless room and help me laugh a bit. 
###POINS
Where’ve you been, Hal? 
###PRINCE HENRY
With three or four knuckleheads and a few dozen kegs of liquor. I’ve been with the lowest of the low. Sirrah, I’ve made great friends with these three bartenders, and I’m on a first-name basis with them: Tom, Dick, and Francis. They swear on their souls that, even though I’m only the Prince of Wales, I’m the king of niceness. They say I’m no pompous fool, like Falstaff, but a good sport, a spirited man, a good boy. When I’m King of England, all the good men of Eastcheap will follow me gladly. When you drink deeply, they joke that you have been dyed red; and if you stop for a breath when you’re drinking, they yell “Cough!” and they command you to keep going. In fifteen minutes, I got so good at being a drinking companion, I could be at ease with any man over a drink, in any setting. Ned, you didn’t do yourself any favors by missing this. But, sweet Ned, I’ll sweeten the name Ned with this bit of sugar, given to me by an apprentice drawer who never spoke any English his whole life, except, “That’ll be eight shillings and sixpence,” and “You’re welcome,” and also, “Just a second, just a second! Bring a pint of bastard to the Half-Moon room!” But Ned, let’s pass the time until Falstaff gets here. Hide in a side room while I ask that little apprentice drawer why he gave me the sugar. Keep calling out his name, Francis, and don’t stop, so that all he’s able to say is, “Just a second!” Step aside, and I’ll give you a taste. 
## POINS exits.
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Perfect. 
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
## FRANCIS, a drawer, enters.
###FRANCIS
Just a second, sir.—Ralph, make sure everything’s okay in the Pomegranate Room! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Come here, Francis. 
###FRANCIS
Sir? 
###PRINCE HENRY
How many more years of your apprenticeship do you have, Francis? 
###FRANCIS
Truly, five years, which is as long — 
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
###FRANCIS
Just a second, sir! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Five years! Wow, that’s a long time to be clinking beer mugs. But Francis, are you brave enough to play the coward with your contract? To flash it your heels, as you run away? 
###FRANCIS
Oh Lord, sir. I’d swear on a stack of Bibles that I’d love to be able to— 
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
###FRANCIS
Just a second, sir! 
###PRINCE HENRY
How old are you, Francis? 
###FRANCIS
Let’s see—at the end of next September, I’ll be— 
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
###FRANCIS
Just a second, sir! (to PRINCE HENRY ) Wait here a moment, my lord. 
###PRINCE HENRY
No, listen to me, Francis. The sugar you gave me was worth about a penny, right? 
###FRANCIS
Oh lord, I wish I could have given you two pennies' worth! 
###PRINCE HENRY
I’ll give you a thousand pounds for it. Ask for it whenever you want it, and it’s yours. 
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
###FRANCIS
Just a second! 
###PRINCE HENRY
You want it in a second, Francis? No, Francis. Maybe tomorrow, Francis, or Thursday, Francis, whenever you want it. But, Francis. 
###FRANCIS
Sir? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Are you ready to rob this man? This man, with his leather jacket, fashionable crystal buttons, short hair, agate signet ring, dark stockings, ribboned garters, oily speech, Spanish leather pouch— 
###FRANCIS
Oh Lord, sir, who are you talking about? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well then, it looks like brown bastard will continue to be your only drink. Because listen, Francis, your white canvas shirt will get stained out there. Even in North Africa, sir, you won’t get so much. 
###FRANCIS
Excuse me, sir? 
###POINS
(offstage) Francis! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Get going, you good-for-nothing. Can’t you hear people calling you? 
## POINS and PRINCE HENRY both begin to shout “Francis!” FRANCIS stands there bewildered, not knowing what to do.
##The VINTNERvintner = innkeeperVINTNER enters.
###VINTNER
Why are you standing there when people are calling you? Take care of the customers inside! 
## FRANCIS exits.
My lord, old Sir John and a half-dozen others are at the door. Should I let them in? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Leave them out there for a while, and then open the door. 
## VINTNER exits.
Poins! 
## POINS enters.
###POINS
Just a second, sir! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are here. Are we ready for a laugh? 
###POINS
We’ll be happy as crickets, my lad. But listen, what’s with this gag you played on the waiter? What’s the point? 
###PRINCE HENRY
I’m up for anything. Right now, I’m feeling all the moods that anyone has ever felt, from the old days of Adam to this young age, right now, at twelve o'clock midnight. 
## FRANCIS enters.
What time is it, Francis? 
###FRANCIS
Just a second, sir. 
## FRANCIS exits.
###PRINCE HENRY
This boy has fewer words than a parrot, but he’s actually a person! All he does is run up and down stairs, and the only things he can say are the names of the items on your bill. I’m not yet like Percy, the Hotspur of the North. He kills six or seven dozen Scotsmen before breakfast, washes his hands, and then says to his wife, “To hell with this boring life! I need something to do!” “Oh, my sweet Harry,” she says, “How many have you killed today?” “Give my brown horse a dose of medicine,” he says. And then about an hour later, he answers her: “About fourteen.” Then he says, “That’s nothing, nothing.” Listen, bring in Falstaff. I’ll play Percy, and that damned fat slob will play his wife, Dame Mortimer. “Bottom’s up!” as the drunk says. Bring in the meat, bring in blubber. 
## FALSTAFF , GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO enter. FRANCIS follows with wine.
###POINS
Welcome, Jack. Where’ve you been? 
###FALSTAFF
A curse on all cowards, I say, and revenge on them, too! Amen to that! Give me some wine, boy. I’m not going to keep up this way of life much longer. I’ll knit socks, mend them, and fix their feet. A curse on all cowards! Give me a cup of wine, you lowlife! Isn’t there any honesty left in this world? (he drinks) 
###PRINCE HENRY
Did you ever see the sun kiss a dish of butter? The tender-hearted sun, melting the butter with its sweet words! If you have, then take a look at Falstaff. 
###FALSTAFF
(to FRANCIS ) You bastard! Somebody put lime in my wine! All men are cheaters and schemers, but a coward is worse than a glass of wine with lime in it. A miserable coward! Go on, old Jack, die already. If there’s even one real man left on this earth besides me, then I’m as skinny as a herring. In all of England there are only three good men that haven’t been put to death, and one of them is fat and growing old. God help us all! It’s a bad world, I say. I wish I were a weaver; I could sing psalms while I was sewing. I’ll say it again: a curse on all cowards. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What’s the matter, you sack of wool? What are you muttering about? 
###FALSTAFF
A King’s son! If I don’t drive you out of the kingdom with a wooden dagger, and send your subjects running before you like a flock of geese, then I’ll never grow a beard again. You, Prince of Wales? What a joke! 
###PRINCE HENRY
You fat son of a whore, what’s the matter? 
###FALSTAFF
Aren’t you a coward? Tell me that. And Poins there? 
###POINS
Dammit, you fat belly. If you call me a coward, I swear, I’ll stab you. 
###FALSTAFF
I call you coward? I’d sooner see you damned than call you a coward, but I tell you; I’d give a thousand pounds to be able to run as fast as you can. You’ve got good-enough–;looking shoulders; you don’t care who sees your back! Is that what you call backing up your friends? Damn anyone who backs up like that! I’d rather have a man who faces me. Give me some wine! I’ll be damned if I’ve had anything to drink today. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Liar! You’ve barely had time to wipe your lips since your last drink. 
###FALSTAFF
Whatever. (he drinks) A curse on all cowards, I still say. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What’s the matter? 
###FALSTAFF
What’s the matter? There are four of us here who stole a thousand pounds this very morning. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Where is it, Jack? Where is it? 
###FALSTAFF
Where is it? It was stolen from us. A hundred men against only four of us. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What, a hundred, man? 
###FALSTAFF
I’ll be damned if I didn’t fight with a dozen of them for two straight hours. It’s a miracle I managed to get away. They stabbed through my shirt eight times. Four through my pants. My shield’s got holes through and through. My sword’s as cut up as a hacksaw. Behold the evidence! It was the best fighting I’ve ever done, but even my all wasn’t enough. A curse on all cowards! (points to GADSHILL, PETO and BARDOLPH) Ask these men. If they don’t tell you the whole truth, they’re liars and devils. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Tell us, men. What happened? 
###GADSHILL
The four of us jumped about a dozen— 
###FALSTAFF
Sixteen at least, my lord. 
###GADSHILL
And tied them up. 
###PETO
No, no. We didn’t tie them up. 
###FALSTAFF
You jerk, we did tie them up, every single one of them, or I’m a Jew, a true Hebrew Jew. 
###GADSHILL
Then, when we were dividing the money, about six or seven other men jumped us— 
###FALSTAFF
And untied the rest, and then all the others showed up. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What, you fought with all of them? 
###FALSTAFF
All? I don’t know what you mean by “all.” But if I didn’t fight with fifty of them, I’m a bunch of radishes. If fifty-two or fifty-three of them didn’t attack me, then I’m no man. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I pray to God you didn’t kill any of them. 
###FALSTAFF
Too late for praying now. I made things hot for two of them; two I’m sure I got, two thugs wearing clothes made of buckram cloth. I’ll tell you what, Hal: if I’m lying to you, spit in my face and call me a horse. You know my old fighting stance. Here’s how I stood, and here’s how I handled my sword. Four thugs in buckram came right at me— 
###PRINCE HENRY
What? Four? You said two a second ago. 
###FALSTAFF
Four, Hal. I said four. 
###POINS
That’s right. He said four. 
###FALSTAFF
These four threw everything they had right at me. I made no big fuss of it; I just put up my shield and all seven of their swords hit it. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Seven? But just now there were only four. 
###FALSTAFF
Wearing buckram? 
###POINS
Yes. Four in clothes made of buckram. 
###FALSTAFF
Seven, I swear on my sword. If not, I’m a liar. 
###PRINCE HENRY
(to POINS , so no one else can hear) Leave him alone. There’ll be more in a minute. 
###FALSTAFF
Are you listening to me, Hal? 
###PRINCE HENRY
I’m listening, Jack. 
###FALSTAFF
Good, because it’s worth paying attention to. Anyway, these nine guys in buckram that I told you about— 
###PRINCE HENRY
So, two more already. 
###FALSTAFF
Since their points were broken— 
###POINS
Their stockings fell down. 
###FALSTAFF
They started to run away, but I followed them closely. And as quick as a thought, I finished off seven of the eleven. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Unbelievable! Eleven buckram men have grown out of two! 
###FALSTAFF
But as the devil would have it, three wretched bastards wearing green came from behind and ran right at me. It was so dark, Hal, that you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. 
###PRINCE HENRY
These lies are like the man who tells them: huge as a mountain, obvious, and plain as day. You clay-brained fatso, you knuckleheaded fool, you son of a whore, you obscene tub of lard— 
###FALSTAFF
What are you, crazy? Are you crazy? Isn’t the truth the truth? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well, how could you know that these men were wearing green when it was so dark you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face? Go ahead, tell us. What do you have to say to that? 
###POINS
Come on, tell us, Jack, go on. 
###FALSTAFF
What, just because you command me? Dammit, if I were being tortured on all the contraptions in the world, I wouldn’t speak just because you commanded. Speak just because you command! If my reasons were as cheap as blackberries, I wouldn’t give away my reasons just because I was commanded. Not I. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I’m not going to put up with this any longer. This red-faced coward, this flattener of mattresses, this breaker of horses' backs, this huge hill of flesh— 
###FALSTAFF
Dammit! You scarecrow, you skin of an elf, you dried-out ox’s tongue, you bull’s penis, you salted cod! Oh, I wish I had enough breath to tell you all the things you are! You yardstick, you empty sheath, you case for a violinist’s bow, you disgusting erect sword— 
###PRINCE HENRY
Catch your breath for a moment, then start again. And when you’ve tired yourself with these awful comparisons, listen to me say just one thing. 
###POINS
Listen closely, Jack. 
###PRINCE HENRY
The two of us saw you four jump four men, tie them up and take their money. Now listen to how the simple truth will shame you. Then the two of us jumped the four of you. And with just a word, we stole your prize from you. Now we have it, and we can show it to you right here in the bar. And Falstaff, you ran away as quickly and as lightfootedly, as a cow from the slaughter, screaming for mercy, as you ran and screamed. What a lowlife you are, to hack up your sword and say it happened in a fight! What outrageous story, what trick, what hiding place can you possibly find to hide you from your open and obvious shame? 
###POINS
Come on, let’s hear it, Jack. What trick have you got now? 
###FALSTAFF
By God, I knew it was you the whole time, like I was your own father! Listen to me, men: would it be right for me to kill the heir-apparent? Should I have attacked the true Prince? Look, you know I’m as brave as Hercules, but you must listen to your instinct. It’s like that old superstition, about how a lion will never attack a true Prince. Instinct is a powerful thing; I was only a coward by instinct. From now on, I’ll have to think of myself as a brave lion, and you as a true Prince. But good God, men, I’m glad you have the money. Hostess! Lock the doors; we’ll celebrate tonight and pray tomorrow. Gentlemen, lads, boys, hearts of gold—I’ll call you every good name I can think of, all at once! Hey! Shall we have some fun? Shall we stage a little play? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Of course, and the play will be about you running away. 
###FALSTAFF
Oh, let it go, Hal, if you love me. 
## MISTRESS QUICKLY enters.
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Oh, Jesus—Your Majesty! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Hello there, my lady the hostess! Do you have something to say to me? 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Indeed, my lord. There’s a nobleman from the royal court at the door, and he wants to speak with you. He says your father sent him. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Give him some coins and send him right back to my mother. 
###FALSTAFF
What kind of man is he? 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
An old man. 
###FALSTAFF
What is an old man doing out of bed at midnight? Do you want me to talk to him? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Please do, Jack. 
###FALSTAFF
Truly, I’ll send him on his way. 
## FALSTAFF exits.
###PRINCE HENRY
Now, men: by God, you fought well. So did you, Peto, and you, Bardolph. You must be lions, too, since your instinct told you to run away. You wouldn’t touch the true Prince; no, indeed! 
###BARDOLPH
Honestly, I ran when I saw the others run. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Okay, now tell me the truth. How did Falstaff’s sword get broken like that? 
###PETO
He hacked away at it with his dagger. He said he would swear up and down to make you believe that it happened in a fight, and he made us do the same. 
###BARDOLPH
Yes, and he made us rub our noses with rough weeds until they started to bleed, then smear our clothes with the blood and swear that it was from the men we fought. When he told me the crazy things he wanted us to do, I did something I haven’t done in seven years: I blushed. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Liar! You stole a cup of wine eighteen years ago, got caught in the act, and you’ve been blushing ever since. You had your fiery-red face and your weapons going for you, but still you ran away. What instinct made you do that? 
###BARDOLPH
Sir, do you see these red welts on my face? Do you see these swellings? 
###PRINCE HENRY
I do. 
###BARDOLPH
What do you think they mean? 
###PRINCE HENRY
That your temper is hot and your wallet is empty. 
###BARDOLPH
It means anger, sir, you interpret it correctly. 
###PRINCE HENRY
It means you’ll be hanged if the authorities catch you. 
## FALSTAFF enters.
Here comes skinny Jack; here comes the bag of bones. What’s going on, now, my sweet windbag? How long has it been, Jack, since you saw your own knees? 
###FALSTAFF
My own knees? When I was your age, Hal, my waist was as skinny as an eagle’s talon; I could have crawled through a councilman’s thumb ring. But damn all that sighing and sadness! It blows a man up like a balloon. There’s bad news out there. That was Sir John Bracy, sent by your father. You have to go to court in the morning. Percy, that mad man from up north, and that Welshman who gave Amamon a beating, and stole Lucifer’s wife, and made a pact to be the devil’s master—what’s his name again? 
###POINS
Oh, Glendower. 
###FALSTAFF
Owen, Owen, that’s the one. And his son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and Douglas, that lively Scot of Scots, who can ride a horse straight up a wall— 
###PRINCE HENRY
The man who can ride at high speeds, then kill a flying sparrow with his pistol. 
###FALSTAFF
You’ve hit it; that’s him exactly. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I may have hit it, but Owen never hit the sparrow. 
###FALSTAFF
Well, that rascal has bravery in him; he won’t run away. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Why, you rascal! You just praised him for running! 
###FALSTAFF
He’ll run on his horse, you cuckoo. But when fighting on foot, he’ll never budge. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Yes he will, Jack. By instinct. 
###FALSTAFF
You’re right, by instinct. Well, he’s there, and a man named Mordake, and a thousand Scottish soldiers besides. Worcester snuck out of London tonight, and your father’s hair turned white when he heard. The price of land has dropped as low as a bucket of stinking fish. 
###PRINCE HENRY
If that’s the case, then when the weather gets hot and the civil war has really broken out, we can buy women’s virtues the way other people buy nails: by the hundreds. 
###FALSTAFF
By God, lad, you tell the truth. We’ll probably have good luck in that area. But Hal, aren’t you scared? You’re the heir apparent. Can you imagine three worse enemies than that demon Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Aren’t you horribly scared? Isn’t your blood running cold at the thought? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Not in the least, truly: I don’t have your instinct. 
###FALSTAFF
Well, you’ll be rebuked horribly when you see your father tomorrow. If you love me, practice a response. 
###PRINCE HENRY
You pretend to be my father; ask me about the details of my life. 
###FALSTAFF
Really? Excellent! This chair will be my throne, this dagger my scepter, and this cushion will be my crown. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Your throne is a wooden stool, your gold scepter is a dagger of lead, and your precious, expensive crown is a lousy bald head. 
###FALSTAFF
If you still have a shred of divine grace in you, you’ll be moved by this. Give me some wine to make my eyes bloodshot, so that it looks like I’ve been crying. I must speak with passion, and I’ll do it like King Cambyses. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well then, I’ll bow to you. 
###FALSTAFF
And I’ll speak to you. Step aside, gentlemen. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Oh, Jesus! This is an excellent game, truly! 
###FALSTAFF
Don’t cry, sweet queen; your trickling tears do no good. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Oh Lord, look how well he’s keeping it up! 
###FALSTAFF
For God’s sake, gentlemen; take my queen away from here. The floodgates of her eyes are being overwhelmed by her tears. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
My God! He’s just as good as those silly old professional actors! 
###FALSTAFF
Quiet, little ale pot. Quiet, little booze-brain. (to PRINCE HENRY) Harry, I am not only amazed at where you are spending your time, but whom you’re spending it with. They say that stepping on a chamomile plant will make it grow faster. But when it comes to youth, the more it is wasted, the faster is wears away. I know you are my son. Your mother says so, I believe so, and the wicked glint in your eye and foolish expression on your face prove it. If it’s true that you are my son, then here is my point: why, since you are my son, do so many people point at you? Should the blessed sun in heaven waste its time eating blackberries? That is not a question worth asking. Should the son of the king of England become a thief and steal wallets? That is worth asking. Harry, you’ve heard of a substance known as pitch. Pitch, as the wise men tell us, makes one filthy, and so does the company you keep. Harry, I speak to you not drunk but weeping, not in happiness but in anger, not just in words but also in sadness. And yet, there is a very good and pious man whom I’ve often seen you with, but I do not know his name. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What kind of man, your highness? 
###FALSTAFF
A stout man, truly; and overweight. He has a cheerful expression, a handsome look, and a noble bearing. I think he is about fifty years old, or perhaps closer to sixty. Now I remember! His name is Falstaff. If that man has a bad character, then I have been fooled. Harry, I see goodness in him. If one can tell a tree by its fruit, and a fruit by its tree, then let me come right out and say this: there is goodness in that Falstaff. Stay with him, but get rid of everyone else. Now tell me, you naughty boy, tell me; where have you been for the past month? 
###PRINCE HENRY
You think you sound like a king? You play me, and I’ll play my father. 
###FALSTAFF
You’re overthrowing me? If you play him even half as well as I did, half as majestically, then hang me up like a rabbit for sale in a butcher shop. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I’m all set. 
###FALSTAFF
As am I. (to the others) Judge us, everyone. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Now, Harry, where are you coming from? 
###FALSTAFF
From Eastcheap, my noble lord. 
###PRINCE HENRY
The complaints I have heard about you are very serious. 
###FALSTAFF
For God’s sake, my lord, they are lies. (to the others) I’ll make you laugh by playing a young prince, I truly will. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Are you swearing, you ungracious boy? From now on, do not even look at me. You have been violently turned away from goodness; there is a devil that haunts you, in the shape of an old, fat man. A ton of man is your companion. Why do you associate with that trunk of bodily fluids, that sifting bin of beastliness, that swollen sack of disease, that huge jug of wine, that stuffed suitcase of guts, that roasted ox crammed with pudding, that ancient Vice, that gray-haired immorality, that father criminal, that aged vanity? What is he good for, besides tasting wine and drinking it? What does he do skillfully, besides carving chickens and eating them? What’s he smart about besides schemes? What does he scheme about besides crime? What is he criminal about besides everything? What is he good for besides nothing? 
###FALSTAFF
I wish your highness would help me follow your meaning. Who do you mean, your grace? 
###PRINCE HENRY
That criminal, loathsome corrupter of youth: Falstaff, that old, white-bearded devil. 
###FALSTAFF
My lord, I know the man. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I know you do. 
###FALSTAFF
But to make me claim that he’s any more harmful than I am—well, I can’t claim that. Yes he’s old, and it’s a shame: his white hair proves it. But that he’s a—forgive me—pimp? That I absolutely deny. If drinking wine and sugar is a fault, then God forgive us all. If being old and merry is a sin, then I know a lot of old men who are going to hell. If being fat means you should be hated, than we should all love Pharoah’s lean cows. No, your highness. Get rid of Peto, get rid of Bardolph, get rid of Poins. But as for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, honest Jack Falstaff, brave Jack Falstaff, and therefore even more brave, given that he is old Jack Falstaff—do not get rid of him. Do not get rid of him. If you get rid of him, you’ll be getting rid of the whole world. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I do. I will. 
##There are knocks from offstage. MISTRESS QUICKLY, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH exit. BARDOLPH comes back, running.
###BARDOLPH
Oh sir, sir! The Sheriff and a frightening group of officers are at the door. 
###FALSTAFF
Wait, you ass! We’ll finish the play: I have much to say on behalf of that Falstaff. 
## MISTRESS QUICKLY enters.
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Jesus! Sir, sir! 
###PRINCE HENRY
Well, look here! All this mess over nothing! What’s the matter? 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
The Sheriff and the officers are at the door. They’ve come to search the place. Should I let them in? 
###FALSTAFF
Do you hear that, Hal? Be careful about calling a piece of real gold a counterfeit; you are genuine, even though it may not seem so. 
###PRINCE HENRY
And you are a genuine coward, with no instinct. 
###FALSTAFF
I deny that. And if you’ll deny the Sheriff, then please do; otherwise, let him in. If I don’t look as good on the hangman’s cart as any other man, then a curse on my upbringing. I’m as willing to be hanged as any man. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Go, hide behind the arras. The rest of you, go upstairs. Now, my men. Here’s wishing for an honest face and a clear conscience. 
###FALSTAFF
I’ve had both of those, but their shelf-life has expired. I’d better hide. (he hides behind the arras) 
##Everyone except for PRINCE HENRY and PETO exits.
###PRINCE HENRY
Call in the Sheriff. 
##The SHERIFF and a CARRIER enter.
Now, Sheriff, what is it you want from me? 
###SHERIFF
First, please forgive me, my lord. A group of citizens followed some criminals into this bar. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What men? 
###SHERIFF
One of them is well known, my gracious lord. A huge, fat man. 
###CARRIER
As fat as butter. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I promise you, that man isn’t here, since he’s currently running an errand for me. Sheriff, I give you my word that by lunchtime tomorrow I’ll send him to you, or anyone else you need to see. He’ll answer to anything he may be accused of. So please, I’d like you to leave this tavern. 
###SHERIFF
I will, my lord. There are also two gentlemen who, in this robbery, lost three hundred marks. 
###PRINCE HENRY
It’s possible. If he did it, he’ll answer for it. And with that, farewell. 
###SHERIFF
Good night, my noble lord. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I think it’s good morning, isn’t it? 
###SHERIFF
Yes, sir. I think it’s two o'clock. 
##The SHERIFF and CARRIER exit.
###PRINCE HENRY
This oily rascal is as famous as St. Paul’s Cathedral. Go, call him out here. 
###PETO
Falstaff! (pulls back the arras) Fast asleep behind the arras, and snoring like a horse. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Listen, how heavily he breathes! Look in his pockets. 
## PETO searches FALSTAFF’s pockets and finds some papers.
What did you find? 
###PETO
Nothing but some papers, my lord. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Let’s see what they are. Read them. 
###PETO
(reads) First, a chicken — two shillings and two pence. Second, sauce — four pence. Third, wine, two gallons —five shillings and eight pence. Fourth, anchovies and dessert wine — two shillings and six pence. Fifth, bread — a halfpenny. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Oh horrible! A halfpenny’s worth of bread against this enormous amount of wine? Hang onto everything else you found; we’ll read it when we have time. Let him sleep there till tomorrow. I’ll go to court in the morning. We’re all off to the wars, and you will have honorable positions. I’ll put this fat rogue in charge of an infantry company, and a quarter mile’s march will be the end of him. The money we stole will be repaid with interest. Meet me early in the morning; and with that, good morning, Peto. 
###PETO
Good morning, my good lord. 
##They exit.
## HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, Lord MORTIMER, and Owen GLENDOWER enter.
###MORTIMER
These commitments are reliable, our allies are solid, and the beginning of our project bodes well. 
###HOTSPUR
Lord Mortimer, and kinsman Glendower, won’t you please sit? And Uncle Worcester—Dammit! I forgot the map! 
###GLENDOWER
Here it is. Sit, kinsman Percy. Sit, good cousin Hotspur. For that is the name King Henry calls you, and whenever he says it, he grows pale, and with a sigh he wishes you were in heaven. 
###HOTSPUR
And you in hell, whenever he hears someone say “Owen Glendower.” 
###GLENDOWER
I don’t blame him. The sky was full of fiery meteors and comets when I was conceived, and when I was born, the entire earth shook like a coward. 
###HOTSPUR
Why, the same thing would have happened if your mother’s cat had given birth to kittens that day, whether you’d been born or not. 
###GLENDOWER
I say there was an earthquake when I was born. 
###HOTSPUR
And I say that if you think the earth shook because it was afraid of you, then the earth and I do not agree. 
###GLENDOWER
The heavens were all on fire, and the earth trembled. 
###HOTSPUR
Oh! Then the earth trembled when it saw the heavens on fire, and not in fear of your birth. When nature is diseased, strange eruptions can break forth. Often, the earth is pinched with a kind of colic, and troubled by gas in her belly. When that gas struggles to be released, it shakes old Mother Earth, bringing down steeples and moss-covered towers. When you were born, our Mother Earth was ill and shook with pain. 
###GLENDOWER
Kinsman, I don’t take this kind of contrary behavior from many people. With your permission, I’ll say one more time that when I was born, the heavens were full of shooting stars. The goats ran down from the mountains, and herds of animals stampeded strangely through the fields. These signs marked me as an extraordinary person. All the events of my life prove that I should not be counted with ordinary men. Is there a man who lives anywhere within England, Scotland, or Wales who can say I learned from him, or that he taught me? And bring forward one human who can follow me in the complicated ways of magic, or keep up with me in my obscure experiments. 
###HOTSPUR
Well, nobody speaks better Welsh. I’m going to lunch. 
###MORTIMER
Stop now, kinsman Percy. You will upset him. 
###GLENDOWER
I can summon spirits from the deep ocean. 
###HOTSPUR
Why, so can I, and so can any other man! But will they come when you summon them? 
###GLENDOWER
Why, kinsman, I can teach you to command the devil. 
###HOTSPUR
And I can teach you, kinsman, how to shame the devil—by telling the truth! “Tell the truth and shame the devil,” as the old saying goes. If you do have the power to call him up, then bring him here. And I’ll swear I have the power to shame him into leaving. Oh, for goodness sake, tell the truth and shame the devil! 
###MORTIMER
Enough already; stop this useless talking. 
###GLENDOWER
Three times now, Henry Bolingbroke has raised an army against mine. And three times, I turned him back from the banks of the River Wye, and the sandy-bottomed River Severn. I sent him home, bootless and beaten by foul weather. 
###HOTSPUR
You sent him home without his boots, and in foul weather? How in the devil’s name did he avoid catching fevers? 
###GLENDOWER
All right, here’s the map. Shall we divide up our territories according to our three-way agreement? 
###MORTIMER
The Archdeacon has divided the land into three very equal parts. All of England southeast of the Trent and Severn rivers goes to me. 
All of Wales, and everything west of the Severn—including all the fertile land within those boundaries—goes to Owen Glendower. And, my dear kinsman, you get everything that remains to the north, coming up from the Trent. Our agreement is drawn up in triplicate. We can all sign it tonight, and then, kinsman Percy, tomorrow you, me, and Worcester will set off to meet your father and the Scottish army at Shrewsbury, as planned. My father-in-law Glendower isn’t ready yet, but we won’t need his army for another two weeks. (to GLENDOWER) By that time, you will have raised an army of the farmers on your land, your allies, and your neighbors. 
###GLENDOWER
I’ll be ready sooner than that, my lords; and I’ll bring your wives along with me. You should sneak away from them now, and leave without saying goodbye. Otherwise, they’ll cry an ocean of tears when you leave them. 
###HOTSPUR
I think my share, north of Burton here, isn’t as big as any of yours. Look how this river swoops in. It cuts out a huge chunk of my best land, in the shape of a half-moon. I’ll have a dam built. I’ll re-route the Trent River so it won’t go winding so far into my land and rob me of a fertile valley. 
###GLENDOWER
It won’t go winding? It will. It must. You see that it does. 
###MORTIMER
Yes, but look how the Trent runs its course and winds a similar distance into my share. It cuts out the same amount of land from my side as it does from yours. 
###WORCESTER
Yes, but a small sum of money will pay to dig a trench, which will reclaim this bit of land on the north side. Then it will run straight along. 
###HOTSPUR
I’ll do that. It will only take a little money. 
###GLENDOWER
I won’t have it changed. 
###HOTSPUR
You won’t? 
###GLENDOWER
No, and neither will you. 
###HOTSPUR
Who’s going to stop me? 
###GLENDOWER
Why, I will. 
###HOTSPUR
Well, say it in Welsh then, so I can’t understand you. 
###GLENDOWER
My lord, I can speak English just as well as you. I was brought up in the English court. There, in my youth, I composed many English songs for the harp, lending the language lovely ornaments of music. That is an accomplishment you have never achieved. 
###HOTSPUR
Indeed, and my whole heart is glad for that. I’d rather be a kitten and say “meow” than be a courtly balladeer. 
I’d rather hear a piece of brass turned on a lathe, or a ungreased wheel grind on its axle. Nothing sets my teeth on edge so as much as finicky poetry; it’s like the lurching steps of a lame horse. 
###GLENDOWER
Fine. Change the Trent’s course. 
###HOTSPUR
I don’t care. I’d gladly give away three times as much land to any friend who deserved it. But when it comes to negotiating a deal, mark my words: I’ll haggle over the smallest fraction of a hair. Are the agreements drawn up? Are we ready to leave? 
###GLENDOWER
The moon is bright; you can leave during the night. I’ll tell the man writing up our documents to hurry, and I’ll tell your wives you’re leaving. I’m afraid my daughter will go mad because she loves Mortimer so much. 
## GLENDOWER exits.
###MORTIMER
Damn, kinsman Percy! How angry you make my father-in-law! 
###HOTSPUR
I can’t help it. He makes me angry with all his talk. Moles and ants, Merlin and his prophecies, dragons, a fish with no fins, a griffin without wings, a raven without feathers, a crouching lion and a cat rearing up to pounce. He talks so much mumbo-jumbo that I don’t know what to believe anymore. I’ll tell you this: he kept me awake last night for at least nine hours, listing the names of all the devils that serve him. I said, “Hmm,” and, “How interesting,” but he didn’t hear a word. Oh, he’s as tedious as a tired horse or a nagging wife; he’s worse than a smoke-filled house. 
I’d rather live in a windmill and eat nothing but cheese and garlic than in a luxurious home eating delicacies, if it meant I had to listen to him talk. 
###MORTIMER
Truly, he’s a worthy man. He’s exceedingly well-read, and proficient in the occult; he’s as brave as a lion, incredibly charming, and as generous as the jewel mines of India. And do you know what, cousin? He holds you in great respect. He restrains his temper when you do something to put him in a bad mood. I promise you, there isn’t a man alive who could have challenged him as you have, and gotten away without being hurt or punished. But don’t try it too often, I beg you. 
###WORCESTER
(to HOTSPUR) Truly, my lord, you are to blame in your stubbornness. Since you arrived, you have done enough to test his patience. You must learn, sir, to correct this fault. Sometimes it demonstrates greatness, courage, strength—and that honors you. But often it reveals fury, bad manners, lack of self-control, pride, arrogance, conceitedness, and contempt. In a gentlemen, the least of these qualities will make you lose people’s affections. It stains your beautiful qualities, making it impossible for them to be noticed. 
###HOTSPUR
Well, I have had my lesson. May good manners bring you success! Here come our wives; let’s say our goodbyes. 
## GLENDOWER enters with the LADIES PERCY AND MORTIMER 
###MORTIMER
This is the bad luck that angers me: my wife speaks no English, and I speak no Welsh. 
###GLENDOWER
My daughter is weeping: she doesn’t want to be parted from you. She wants to be a soldier and join you in the war. 
###MORTIMER
Father-in-law, tell her that she and Lady Percy will come with you after us. 
## GLENDOWER and THE LADY speak in Welsh.
###GLENDOWER
She’s desperate now; a cranky, selfish hussy. Nobody can change her mind. 
## THE LADY speaks more Welsh.
###MORTIMER
I understand you by the look on your face. Those pretty Welsh tears streaming from your heavenly eyes I understand perfectly; I’d answer in the same language, if it weren’t shameful for a man to cry. 
## THE LADY speaks more Welsh.
I understand your kisses and you mine; that’s a conversation of emotion. I’ll study continuously, my love, until I learn your language. Your voice makes Welsh sound as sweet as the most eloquently written songs, sung by a fair queen in a garden of summer flowers, with a gorgeous accompaniment on her a lute. 
###GLENDOWER
No, if you start to cry, you’ll drive her mad. 
## THE LADY speaks more Welsh.
###MORTIMER
Oh, I have no idea what she’s saying! 
###GLENDOWER
She wants you to lie down on the rush-covered floor and rest your head in her lap. She’ll sing whatever song you like, and she’ll lull you to sleep. She’ll bewitch you into a pleasant heaviness, halfway between waking and sleeping; like the hour just before the sun begins its golden rise in the east. 
###MORTIMER
I’ll gladly sit and hear her sing. By the time she’s done, I think our documents will be prepared. 
###GLENDOWER
Do so. The musicians who are going to play are now floating in the air a thousand leagues from here. They’ll be here shortly; so sit, and listen. 
###HOTSPUR
Kate! You’re good at lying down. Come quickly, so that I can put my head in your lap. 
###LADY PERCY
Stop it, you silly goose. 
##Music plays.
###HOTSPUR
Now I see that the devil understands Welsh; it’s no surprise he’s so moody. By God, he’s a good musician. 
###LADY PERCY
Then you should be incredibly musical, for you’re the moodiest man alive. Lie still, you thief. Listen to the lady sing in Welsh. 
###HOTSPUR
I’d rather hear Lady, my dog, howl in Irish. 
###LADY PERCY
Do you want your head broken in? 
###HOTSPUR
No. 
###LADY PERCY
Then be still. 
###HOTSPUR
Never; that’s a womanly trait. 
###LADY PERCY
Now God help you— 
###HOTSPUR
Into the Welsh lady’s bed! 
###LADY PERCY
What did you say? 
###HOTSPUR
Quiet! She’s singing. 
## THE LADY sings a Welsh song.
###HOTSPUR
Come on, Kate. I want to hear your song, too. 
###LADY PERCY
Not mine, darn it. 
###HOTSPUR
Not yours? Darn it? Honestly! You swear like a candymaker’s wife. “Not you, darn it.” And “I swear on my life,” and “God forgive me,” and “as plain as day.” Your curse words are smooth as silk. You’d think you’d never gone further than Finsbury in your life. Swear like the real lady you are, Kate. Let loose a good mouthful of curses; leave “darn” and such watered-down cursewords to those citizens, trimmed in velvet and wearing their Sunday best. Come on, sing. 
###LADY PERCY
I will not sing. 
###HOTSPUR
It’s the quickest way to become a tailor; tailors love to sing. Or you could teach songs to birds. If our agreements are drawn up, I’ll be gone within two hours; come find me whenever you want. 
## HOTSPUR exits.
###GLENDOWER
Come now, Mortimer. You’re as reluctant to leave as Percy is on fire to go. Our agreements are drawn up by now. We’ll sign and then go straight to our horses. 
###MORTIMER
I go with all my heart. 
##They exit.
##The KING, PRINCE HENRY of Wales, and others enter.
###KING
Gentlemen, please leave; the Prince of Wales and I must speak in private. But stay close by, for I’ll need you in a moment. 
##The lords exit.
I don’t know whether God decided, because of some displeasing crime I have committed, to turn my own flesh and blood into a punisher and a plague upon me. The course of your life has me convinced that you are only meant for one purpose in this world: to be God’s vengeance against me for all my misdeeds. Why else would such disorderly and low desires, such poor, such wretched, such lewd, such despicable actions, such wasteful pleasures, and such vulgar company become associated with your high-born self, and call themselves equals with a Prince like you? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Your majesty, I wish I could be proven innocent of all those accusations, for I can certainly clear myself of many of them. But let me beg one favor of you: if I can demonstrate that I’m not guilty of the false charges of these smiling flatterers and wretched gossips (the kinds of stories that are always told about great men), then you will forgive me when I confess to the youthful indiscretions I actually did commit. 
###KING
Let God forgive you! But I’m amazed, Harry, at your inclinations, which run completely contrary to those of your ancestors. Your vulgar behavior has cost you your place on my council, a position now held by your younger brother. You have almost completely alienated yourself from the good graces of the courtiers and the other members of the royal family. The hopes of your youth are now ruined; every man, in his heart, thinks he can see your downfall. If I had been so publicly visible, so overly familiar to people, so freely accessible, so cheap and available to the common hordes, then public opinion (which helped me get the crown) would have stayed loyal to King Richard. I would have stayed a banished man, with no reputation and no promise of success. But because I was so rarely seen in public, people were amazed by me when I did appear; they acted as if I were a comet. Men would tell their children, “That’s him!” Others would ask, “Where? Which one’s Bolingbroke?” I was more gracious than heaven; I acted so modestly that I won the allegiance of their hearts, and the shouts and salutes of their mouths. They even did so when the King himself was present. This is how I kept myself fresh and new. I was like a priest’s ceremonial vestments: rarely seen, but admired. I appeared seldomly, but marvelously, like a feast made all the more impressive by its rarity. Now, ridiculous King Richard pranced about with vapid clowns and superficial wits, quickly lit and just as quickly burnt out. He degraded himself, mingling his royal self with those skipping fools. 
His reputation was ruined by their scornful attitudes. He lost face by laughing with those joking boys, and tolerating the rudeness of every smooth-faced, disdainful prankster. He spent his time in common, public places, surrendering himself to the pursuit of popularity. Soon, they saw him every day and it was like overdosing on honey; they began to hate the taste of that sweetness. A little too much is as bad as far too much. Seeing him became as common a sight as a cuckoo in June—heard but not paid attention to; seen, but by eyes so used to seeing that they took it for granted. They didn’t look with a special gaze, as they do at the sun when it shines only rarely. Instead, they grew bored, they looked away. They slept in front of him and watched him dully, the way a sullen man looks at his enemy. They were stuffed, gorged, and full with his presence. And that is just where you stand, Harry. You have lost your princely status by associating with vile criminals: there’s not an eye in the kingdom that isn’t weary of looking at you. No eyes except mine, that is, which had wished to see more of you; and now they’re acting against me, blinding themselves with foolish tears. 
###PRINCE HENRY
From now on, my very gracious father, I will behave more like myself. 
###KING
At this moment, you seem just like Richard did when I returned from France to lead the revolt. And just as I was then, Percy seems now. 
I swear on my scepter and my soul, he has more of a right to the throne than you, you shadowy copy of a king. For without a right to the throne—nor anything even resembling a right—he has filled the kingdom’s battlefields with armies. He seeks to lead an army against the King, into the jaws of the lion. And even though he is no older than you are, he leads old statesmen and venerable bishops into bloody battles and violent wars. What lasting honor he won, by beating the renowned Douglas! That man’s great exploits, violent invasions, and glorious military reputation had won him praise throughout the Christian world as the most outstanding soldier. And yet Hotspur, this Mars in baby clothes, this infant warrior, has defeated Douglas three times, captured him once, then freed him and made him his ally. Now they have become a huge threat to my throne. And what do you have to say about this? Percy, Northumberland, the Archbishop of York, Douglas, and Mortimer have banded together, and now they are after me. But why am I telling you this? Why should I tell you about my foes, Harry, when you are my most beloved and most dangerous enemy? With your sycophantic fear, your vulgar inclinations, and your short temper, I wouldn’t be surprised if you left me to fight under Percy, following his heels like a dog and bowing to him when he frowns. Just to prove what a degenerate you are. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Don’t think that; that will not happen. God forgive whoever turned you against me like this! I’ll redeem myself by beating Percy. And at the end of some 
glorious victory, I’ll come to you and proudly say that I am your son. I will wear a garment made of blood, and my face will be stained by a bloody mask which, when washed away, will clean me of my shame. This will be the day, whenever it happens, that this famous and honored child—this brave Hotspur, this highly praised knight—will meet your disregarded Harry in battle. I wish that every honor he’s earned were multiplied, and that every one of my shames were doubled. For the time will come when I’ll make this youth from the north exchange his glorious deeds for my embarrassments. Percy is working for me, my lord. He’s collecting glories on my behalf, and I’m going to hold him strictly accountable for them. He’ll either have to surrender every last one of those glories to me, no matter how small, or I’ll tear them right out of his heart. This I promise you, in the name of God. And if God allows me to do these things, then I beg you to heal the wound caused by my long years of bad behavior. If not, then my death will cancel all my debts. I would rather die a hundred-thousand deaths than break even the smallest part of this promise. 
###KING
Through this vow, a hundred-thousand rebels are killed. You will be given a position of command, and absolute trust in this undertaking. 
## BLUNT enters.
What’s wrong, Blunt? You look like there’s an emergency. 
###BLUNT
There is, which is what I’ve come to tell you. Lord Mortimer of Scotland sent word that Douglas and the English rebels met at Shrewsbury, on the eleventh of this month. If everyone involved keeps their word, they will have an army as enormous and terrifying as any that ever caused trouble in this kingdom. 
###KING
We heard this news five days ago. The Earl of Westmoreland left today, along with my son Lord John of Lancaster. Harry, you’ll go next Wednesday. On Thursday, I will go myself. We’ll meet at Bridgenorth. Harry, you will march through Gloucestershire. Given the amount of time we’ll all need, we should come together with our full forces at Bridgenorth twelve days from now. There’s a lot to do, so let’s go. Our enemies will take advantage if we’re slow. 
##They exit.
## FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH enter.
###FALSTAFF
Bardolph, haven’t I shrivelled since our last robbery? Haven’t I gotten thin? Aren’t I shrinking? My skin is hanging off me like a loose gown on an old lady; I’m puckered like a rotten apple. I’d better repent my sins, and fast, while there’s still something left of me. I’ll be in bad shape soon, and then I won’t have the strength to repent. If I haven’t forgotten what the inside of a church looks like, I’m a withered berry, a lame old nag. The inside of a church! The wrong crowd, the wrong crowd has ruined me. 
###BARDOLPH
Sir John, you complain so much, you’re sure not to live much longer. 
###FALSTAFF
You’re absolutely right. Come on then, sing me a dirty song. Make me laugh. I lived my life as properly as a gentleman should. Well, properly enough, anyway. I didn’t swear much. I didn’t gamble—more than seven days a week. I went to a whorehouse no more than once—every fifteen minutes. I paid my debts—three or four times. I lived well and within reasonable boundaries. And now, I live poorly and out of moderation. 
###BARDOLPH
You’re so fat, Sir John, that you have no choice but to live out of moderation: moderation could not fit you. 
###FALSTAFF
You fix your face and I’ll fix my life. You’re like the flagship of our fleet, with a light on its bow—except that your light is in your nose. 
###BARDOLPH
Why, Sir John, my face isn’t hurting you. 
###FALSTAFF
No, you’re right. I actually get some good from your face: it’s like a skull, or a death token. I can’t look at your face without thinking of the flames of hell, and Dives from the Bible, who burned eternally. If there were anything pious about you, I could swear oaths on your face. I could say, “Now, by this fire, which is God’s angel …” But you’re a complete sinner, and if it weren’t for the light in your face, you’d be the son of darkness. When you ran up Gadshill at night to find my horse, I could have sworn you were a will-o-the-wisp or a fireball. You’re an endless torchlight parade, a permanent bonfire. Walking with you from tavern to tavern at night has saved me a thousand marks in candles and flashlights. But the money I’ve spent on wine for you would have been enough to buy the most expensive candles in Europe. I’ve kept that nose of yours burning for thirty-two years, God bless me. 
###BARDOLPH
Dammit! I wish my face were in your belly. 
###FALSTAFF
God have mercy! Then I’d surely have heartburn. 
## MISTRESS QUICKLY enters.
Hello there, Madame Clucking Chicken! Have you figured out yet who picked my pocket? 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Now Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I have thieves in my establishment? I’ve searched, I’ve asked questions; so has my husband. We’ve asked every man, boy and servant here. No one’s ever lost so much as a fraction of a hair in this tavern before. 
###FALSTAFF
You lie! Bardolph got a shave here, and he lost a lot of hair. And I swear my pocket was picked. To hell with you, you’re a woman. To hell with you. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Who, me? No, I say. By God, I’ve never been called such a thing in my own tavern before. 
###FALSTAFF
Oh come on, I know all about you. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
No, Sir John; you don’t know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you’re making a fuss so that you can cheat me out of it. I have bought you a dozen shirts to wear. 
###FALSTAFF
Junk, cheap junk. I gave them away to bakers' wives, to sift flour with. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
I swear, as an honest woman, that they were made of expensive fabric, eight shillings an ell. Besides, you owe me money for food and drink, plus twenty-four pounds I lent you. 
###FALSTAFF
(points at BARDOLPH) He had some of it. Let him pay. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Him? He’s poor, he has nothing. 
###FALSTAFF
What? Poor? Look at his face. What do you call rich? They could make coins from his nose, mint his cheeks. I won’t pay a denier. You think I’m a rube? What, I can’t relax at a tavern without getting my pocket picked? I lost my grandfather’s sealing ring, worth forty marks. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Jesus! I’ve heard the Prince tell him countless times that ring was only made out of copper. 
###FALSTAFF
What? The Prince is a bastard, a sneak. Dammit, if he were here and said something like that, I’d beat him like a dog. 
## PRINCE HENRY and PETO enter, marching like soldiers. FALSTAFF joins them, pretending that his cudgel is a fife, or military flute.
Hey there, lad! Is that what’s happening? Are we all going to march? 
###BARDOLPH
Yes, side by side, like prisoners to the gallows. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
My lord, please, listen to me. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What is it, Mistress Quickly? How’s your husband? I think highly of him; he’s an honest man. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
My lord, please listen to me. 
###FALSTAFF
Forget about her, and listen to me. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What is it, Jack? 
###FALSTAFF
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and I had my pocket picked. This bar’s like a whorehouse: they pick your pockets. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What did you lose, Jack? 
###FALSTAFF
Would you believe it, Hal? Three or four I.O.U.’s worth forty pounds each, and my grandfather’s sealing ring. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Junk, not worth more than eight pennies. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
That’s what I said, my lord. And I said I’d heard you say so, and then he said awful things about you, like the foul-mouthed man that he is. He said he’d beat you. 
###PRINCE HENRY
What? He did? 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
If he didn’t, I’m not faithful, trustworthy or womanly. 
###FALSTAFF
You’re about as faithful as a whore, as trustworthy as a fox on the run, and—as for womanhood—a man in a dress is the minister’s wife compared to you. Get out of here, you thing, get out. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
Thing? What thing? 
###FALSTAFF
What thing? A thing to say “thank God” for. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
I am not a thing to say “thank God” for, I want you to know; I am an honest man’s wife. And ignoring the fact that you are a knight, you are a brute for calling me that. 
###FALSTAFF
Well, if you ignore the fact that you’re a woman, then I suppose that would make you an animal. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
What animal, you brute? 
###FALSTAFF
What animal? Why, an otter. 
###PRINCE HENRY
An otter, Sir John? Why an otter? 
###FALSTAFF
Because she’s not quite a fish and not quite a mammal. A man wouldn’t know where to put her. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
You’re awful for saying so: you or any man would know where to put me, you brute, you! 
###PRINCE HENRY
You’re right, hostess, and he has really insulted you. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
He insulted you, too, my lord. Just the other day, he said you owed him a thousand pounds. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pounds? 
###FALSTAFF
A thousand pounds, Hal? A million. Your love is worth a million, and you owe me your love. 
###MISTRESS QUICKLY
No, sir. He called you a bastard and said he’d beat you. 
###FALSTAFF
Did I, Bardolph? 
###BARDOLPH
Indeed, Sir John, you said so. 
###FALSTAFF
That’s right, if he said my ring was junk and made of copper. 
###PRINCE HENRY
And I do say that it’s made of copper. So will you dare keep your word and beat me? 
###FALSTAFF
Hal, know this: if you were only a man, I would dare. But since you’re also a Prince, I’m scared of you, as much as I’m scared by the roar of a lion’s cub. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Why the cub and not the lion? 
###FALSTAFF
Only the King is as frightening as the lion. You think I’m as scared of you as I am of your father? If I am, I pray to God for my belt to break. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Oh, but if it did, your guts would fall down to your knees! Sirrah, there’s no room in your chest for trustworthiness, truthfulness, or honesty. It’s all filled up with guts and stomach. Accuse an honest woman of picking your pocket? You son of a whore; you rude, bloated cheat. I’ll be damned if there was anything in your pocket besides tavern bills, notes about whorehouses, and a penny’s worth of candy for energy. If you had anything else in your pockets, then I’m a liar; yet you stand by your lies. You won’t even try to hide how bad you are. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? 
###FALSTAFF
Don’t you know, Hal? Adam fell from grace when the world was innocent. What should poor Jack Falstaff do, now that the world is wicked? You see I have more flesh than other men. It follows that I’m more fallible than other men.—So you’re confessing to picking my pocket? 
###PRINCE HENRY
It looks that way. 
###FALSTAFF
Hostess, I forgive you. Go get breakfast ready; love your husband; tend to your servants; cherish your guests. You’ll find me a perfectly reasonable man. See? I’m calm, as always. Now please, get going! 
## MISTRESS QUICKLY exits.
Now Hal, what’s the news at court? What ever happened about our robbery? 
###PRINCE HENRY
I’m your guardian angel again, you fresh piece of meat. The money’s been paid back. 
###FALSTAFF
I don’t like that “paying back.” It means twice the work! 
###PRINCE HENRY
My father and I are friends again, and I can do whatever I want. 
###FALSTAFF
Then rob the treasury right away, and don’t even delay long enough to wash your hands. 
###BARDOLPH
Do it, my lord. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I have gotten you an infantry company to command, Jack. 
###FALSTAFF
I wish it were the horse brigade. Where can I recruit a talented crook? Oh, if I only had a gifted thief, about twenty-two years old! I’m terribly lacking in help. Well, thank God for these rebels. The only people they bother are the good people. I like that. I honor and salute them. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Bardolph! 
###BARDOLPH
My lord? 
###PRINCE HENRY
Deliver this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, my brother. Give this one to Westmoreland. 
## BARDOLPH exits.
Peto, get to your horse, get to your horse! You and I have to be thirty miles from here by lunchtime. 
## PETO exits.
Jack, meet me at Temple Hall at two o'clock tomorrow. You’ll get the list of your troops there, plus some money and an order for their equipment. The country is on fire, and Percy’s riding high. Either they or we must die. 
## PRINCE HENRY exits.
###FALSTAFF
Well spoken! What a splendid world! Bring my breakfast, hostess! I wish that I could lead my troops from here! 
##He exits.
## HOTSPUR, WORCESTER , and DOUGLAS enter.
###HOTSPUR
Well said, you excellent Scotsman. If people these days didn’t confuse the truth with flattery, I would praise you highly. No other soldier so newly tested in battle would have gained such a widespread reputation. God knows, I don’t flatter: I hate people who give out praise too easily. But you have a place in my heart that no other man has. Make me prove it; try me. 
###DOUGLAS
You are the most honorable man alive, and if any man challenges that—no matter how powerful—I’ll defy him. 
###HOTSPUR
You do that. Well done. 
##A MESSENGER enters with letters.
What letters have you got there? (to DOUGLAS ) All I can do is thank you. 
###MESSENGER
These letters come from your father. 
###HOTSPUR
Letters from him? Why isn’t he here in person? 
###MESSENGER
He can’t come, my lord; he’s terribly sick. 
###HOTSPUR
Damn! How can he take the leisure of being sick at such a frantic time? Who’s in charge of his army? Who’s leading them here? 
###MESSENGER
His letters will tell you his plans, my lord, not I. 
###WORCESTER
Pardon me, but is he bedridden? 
###MESSENGER
He had been, sir, for four days before I left. And on the day I left, his doctors were extremely concerned. 
###WORCESTER
I wish he’d waited till things were settled before he went and got sick. We’ve never needed him more than now. 
###HOTSPUR
Sick now? Faint now? His disease is infecting our entire project. It’s spread all the way to here, right to our camp. He writes that some internal illness—and that his allies couldn’t be gathered so quickly by one of his deputies. Besides, he didn’t think it was appropriate to delegate such a dangerous and important task to someone other than himself. But he also says that we should be bold and press on with our small contingent. For, as he writes, there’s no turning back now, since the King surely knows our plans. What do you think? 
###WORCESTER
Your father’s sickness is a serious injury to us. 
###HOTSPUR
It’s a perilous wound, like losing a limb. And yet, truly, it’s not that bad; the loss of my father seems worse than it is. After all, is it a good idea to bet all our resources on one throw of the dice? Or to gamble such a rich stake on a single hazardous event? No, because that would mean we had reached the end of our hope, and the very limit of our luck. 
###DOUGLAS
That’s right. We have a chance at a rich inheritance; we can take a risk now, based on the promise of success to come. That gives us comfort, something to fall back on. 
###HOTSPUR
It gives us a refuge, a home we can always run to, in case the devil or misfortune ruins these early plans. 
###WORCESTER
I still wish your father were here. Our endeavor here won’t withstand any division. People who don’t realize your father is sick will assume that he knows some kind of secret, or that he is loyal to the King, or that he doesn’t approve of how we’re handling things. And just imagine how that kind of mistrust could frighten our more timid supporters, and lead them to doubt us. You know very well that the challenger must always avoid careful examination. We must seal every crack, every loophole, which skeptics might look through to see weaknesses. Your father’s absence draws the curtains back and reveals frightful things to ignorant people, who had never had a reason to fear before. 
###HOTSPUR
You’re taking this too far. I’d rather think about his absence this way: it makes us look even better. It makes our great undertaking seem even more daring than it would if Northumberland were here. People will think that if we can raise an army against the King without my father, that once he joins we’ll turn the whole kingdom upside down. Everything is fine, we’re all in one piece. 
###DOUGLAS
We’re as well off as we could have hoped. In Scotland, we don’t even know the meaning of the word fear. 
##Sir Richard VERNON enters
###HOTSPUR
Welcome, kinsman Vernon, from the bottom of my heart. 
###VERNON
I pray to God that what I have to say is worth welcoming, my lord. The Earl of Westmoreland, with seven thousand men, is marching this way. Prince John is with him. 
###HOTSPUR
Nothing to be worried about. What else? 
###VERNON
I’ve also learned that the King himself is coming this way, or at least plans to very soon, with a huge and powerful force. 
###HOTSPUR
We’ll welcome him too. Where’s his son, that sporting, foolhardy Prince of Wales, and his comrades, who don’t care about anything? 
###VERNON
They’re all in uniform, all armed. They look like feathered ostriches; like eagles beating their wings after a bath; like statues painted gold. They’re as lively as the springtime; as gorgeous as the midsummer sun; as giddy as young goats; as wild as young bulls. I saw young Harry with his helmet on, and armor on his thighs. Armed with powerful weapons, he rose off the ground like the winged god Mercury, and leaped so effortlessly into his saddle, it was as if an angel had dropped out of the sky to ride a fiery Pegasus, and bewitch the world with his incredible horsemanship. 
###HOTSPUR
Stop, stop! This praise of him makes me sicker than the sun on an early spring day. Let them come, like sacrifices in all their finery; we’ll offer them, hot and bleeding, to the fire-eyed goddess of smoky war. The war-god Mars will sit on his altar, up to his ears in blood. I am on fire, knowing that this rich prize is so near, and yet still not ours. Come, bring me my horse, who will carry me like a lightning bolt to face the Prince of Wales. Then this Harry will meet that Harry, my horse against his horse; we’ll meet and never separate, till one of us falls down as a corpse. Oh, I wish that Glendower were here! 
###VERNON
I have more news: as I passed through the town of Worcester, I heard that Glendower won’t be able to collect his army for two more weeks. 
###DOUGLAS
That’s the worst news I’ve heard so far. 
###WORCESTER
Yes, truly, that news makes me cold. 
###HOTSPUR
How many men in the King’s army? 
###VERNON
Thirty thousand. 
###HOTSPUR
Let it be forty. Even with both my father and Glendower absent, our armies may still be enough to win. Come on, let’s gather our troops right now. It’s almost doomsday; if we die, we die cheerfully. 
###DOUGLAS
Don’t talk about dying. I won’t even worry about dying for the next six months. 
##They exit.
## FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH enter.
###FALSTAFF
Bardolph, go ahead of us to Coventry, and fill me a bottle of wine. Our army will keep marching, and we’ll make it to Sutton Coldfield tonight. 
###BARDOLPH
Will you give me some money, captain? 
###FALSTAFF
Spend your own. 
###BARDOLPH
If I buy you this bottle, that makes me an angel. 
###FALSTAFF
Well, if this bottle earns you an angel, then keep it for your troubles. If you earn twenty angels, then keep them all; I’m good for it. Tell my lieutenant Peto to meet me at the city limit. 
###BARDOLPH
I will, captain. Farewell. 
## BARDOLPH exits.
###FALSTAFF
If I’m not ashamed of my soldiers, then I’m a pickled fish. I’ve taken terrible advantage of my position. I’ve pressed a hundred and fifty soldiers into service, and for that, the treasury has paid me over three hundred pounds. I recruited only well-to-do property owners and rich farmer’s sons. I looked for men who were engaged to be married, who were already halfway through their preparations. I found a whole supply of pampered cowards who would rather listen to the devil than a military march; who feared the sound of gunfire 
more than a wounded bird or a maimed duck might. I recruited only the soft-hearted, who each had as much courage as could fit on a pin head and bribed me to avoid fighting. So now, my battalion is made up of flag bearers, corporals, lieutenants, and crooks as ragged as Lazarus in those paintings where the dogs are licking the sores on his body. I have men who’ve never been soldiers: servants dismissed for their dishonesty; youngest sons with no hope of an inheritance; runaway apprentice bartenders; unemployed stable boys. When the world is calm and peaceful, these men are blisters on society. They’re ten times more ragged than an old, tattered flag, and they’re the kind of men I have to replace the ones who bribed me. You’d think I had a hundred and fifty men who’d just come from pig farming, who eat scraps and garbage. One madman saw us on the march and told me that it looked as if I’d unloaded all the gallows and drafted all the dead bodies. No one’s ever seen such a group of scarecrows. I’m not going to march through Coventry with them tonight, that’s for sure. They march with their legs wide apart, as though they had chains on their ankles. Which makes sense, since I drafted most of them out of jails. There’s only a shirt and a half in the whole group, and the half-shirt is really just two napkins sewn together and thrown over the shoulders like a cape. And the whole shirt, to tell the truth, was stolen from a tavern owner in St. Alban’s, or maybe that drunken innkeeper in Daventry. But that doesn’t matter. They’ll be able to steal plenty of clothing from the hedges, where the washers hang the laundry out to dry. 
## PRINCE HENRY and Lord WESTMORELAND enter.
###PRINCE HENRY
What’s up, swollen Jack! What’s up, quilt? 
###FALSTAFF
Hello there, Hal, you crazy boy! What in the devil’s name are you doing in Warwickshire? And Lord Westmoreland, I beg your pardon. I thought you were already at Shrewsbury. 
###WESTMORELAND
You’re right, Sir John; it’s about time I got there, and you, too. But my army’s already there. The King is waiting for us, so we must march all night. 
###FALSTAFF
Don’t worry about me. I’m as focused as a cat looking for cream to steal. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Steal cream is right—you’ve stolen so much that it’s turned you into butter. But tell me, Jack, whose soldiers are those? 
###FALSTAFF
Mine, Hal, mine. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I never saw such pitiful-looking losers. 
###FALSTAFF
Now, now: they’re good enough to die. Cannon fodder, cannon fodder—they’ll fill a mass grave as well as better men would. They’re just men, just men. 
###WESTMORELAND
Maybe so, Sir John, but I think they look terribly poor and bare; they look like beggars. 
###FALSTAFF
Well, I don’t know where they got their poverty, but their bareness—or their bare-bonedness—well, they didn’t get that from me. 
###PRINCE HENRY
That’s for sure. Unless you think several inches of fat over your ribs makes you “bare-boned.” But hurry up, sirrah: Percy is already at the battlefield. 
## PERCY exits.
###FALSTAFF
What, has the King already made camp? 
###WESTMORELAND
He has, Sir John: I’m afraid we may be too late. 
###FALSTAFF
Well, a hungry guest arrives early for a feast, but a poor soldier arrives late to a battle. 
##They exit.
## HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON enter.
###HOTSPUR
We’ll fight him tonight. 
###WORCESTER
We can’t do that. 
###DOUGLAS
Then you’re giving him the advantage. 
###VERNON
Not in the least. 
###HOTSPUR
Why do you say that? Doesn’t he have backup coming? 
###VERNON
So do we. 
###HOTSPUR
His is guaranteed. Ours isn’t. 
###WORCESTER
Nephew, I’m telling you. Don’t start the fighting tonight. 
###VERNON
(to HOTSPUR ) Don’t, my lord. 
###DOUGLAS
You’re giving poor advice, based on fear and cowardice. 
###VERNON
Don’t slander me, Douglas. I swear on my life—and I’ll prove it with my life—that if I’m roused to fight through thoughtful, careful consideration, I’m just as unafraid as you, my lord, or any Scotsman alive. In tomorrow’s battle, we’ll see which one of us is afraid. 
###DOUGLAS
Fine. Or tonight. 
###VERNON
That’s enough. 
###HOTSPUR
Tonight, I say. 
###VERNON
Come on, we can’t do that. I wonder how—being the great leaders you are—you cannot see the problems we’re facing. My cousin has yet to arrive with his horses, and your Uncle Worcester’s troops only arrived today. Their spirit and their bravery is asleep; their courage is dulled and tamed by the hard journey. They don’t have even a quarter of their usual strength. 
###HOTSPUR
The enemy’s horses are tired from the journey as well. The majority of ours are well-rested. 
###WORCESTER
But the King has more men then we do. For God’s sake, nephew, wait until everyone arrives. 
##A trumpet announces the approach of an envoy.
## BLUNT enters.
###BLUNT
I’m here with a generous offer from the King, if you’ll listen to me and treat me with respect. 
###HOTSPUR
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt. I wish to God you were on our side. Many of us think very highly of you, though we begrudge you your honor and reputation, since you fight on the enemy’s side. 
###BLUNT
And I hope to God I always will, so long as you overstep the bounds of allegiance and duty by standing against the anointed King. But let me get to the point. The King sent me to learn your complaints, and to find out why you are stirring up warfare in a time of peace, and spreading violent dissent throughout his loyal country. If the King has somehow overlooked one of your deserving acts—which, he admits, there are many—he asks you to name your complaints. He’ll meet your demands, with interest, as quickly as possible, and grant an absolute pardon to you and everyone who has followed your mistaken lead. 
###HOTSPUR
That’s kind of the King. We know all too well about the promises the King makes, and the ways he keeps his word. My father, my uncle, and I put that crown on his head. And when he had barely twenty-six men supporting him, when no one cared about him, when he was wretched and low, a poor, forsaken criminal trying to sneak home, my father welcomed him. When he swore an oath to God, weeping and speaking passionately, that he had come back to England only to reclaim his father’s title and make peace with King Richard, my father took pity on him, swore to help him and did so. When the country’s most important men saw that Northumberland was on his side, they came to see Henry, and bowed down to him. They met him in towns, cities, villages; they waited for him on bridges, stood in the streets, lay gifts before him, swore their loyalty, pledged the support of their sons, followed him like servants. Soon enough, he began to understand his power. He overstepped the promise he’d made to my father at Ravenspurgh, when his blood was still humble. And then, suddenly, he took it upon himself to reform certain laws and strict decrees that weighed too heavily on the kingdom. He made angry speeches about the abuses we were suffering, and seemed to weep over the country’s problems. And with this face, this mask of righteousness, he won everyone’s hearts. Then he went even further, and cut off the heads of all of Richard’s deputies, who stayed behind to run the country while Richard was waging war in Ireland. 
###BLUNT
I didn’t come here to listen to this. 
###HOTSPUR
Then I’ll get to the point. A little while later, he overthrew King Richard. Soon after that, he killed him. And right after that, he raised taxes on everyone. To make matters worse, he allowed his kinsman Mortimer—who by rights ought to be the king—to be imprisoned in Wales, and remain there without ransom. He tried to use my victories to disgrace me, and tried to trap me with spies. He dismissed my uncle from his royal Council, threw my father out of the royal court, broke promise after promise, and committed crime after crime. In conclusion, he forced us to raise this army for our own safety, and to question his claim on the crown, which we believe is too flimsy to stand. 
###BLUNT
Should I bring this answer to the King? 
###HOTSPUR
No, Sir Walter. We’ll stand down for a while. Go to the King. My uncle will bring him our demands early in the morning, provided that you arrange for a guarantee that he’ll be allowed to return safely. And so, farewell. 
###BLUNT
I wish you would accept the King’s offer of kindness and love. 
###HOTSPUR
Perhaps we will. 
###BLUNT
I pray to God you do. 
##They exit.
##The ARCHBISHOP of York and SIR MICHAEL enter.
###ARCHBISHOP
Hurry, Sir Michael, bring this sealed letter as fast as you can to the Lord Marshal. Bring this one to Scroop, and all the rest to whom they are addressed. If you knew how important they were, you would hurry. 
###SIR MICHAEL
My good lord, I can guess what they say. 
###ARCHBISHOP
I’m sure you can. Tomorrow, Sir Michael, ten thousand men will try their luck. I’m told that at Shrewsbury, the King—with a huge and quickly assembled army—will fight Harry Percy. I’m afraid, Michael, that without Northumberland, whose army was the largest of all, and without Owen Glendower, who was also being counted on but is absent because his horoscope told him to stay away, I’m afraid that Percy’s army will be too weak to fight the King right now. 
###SIR MICHAEL
Don’t worry, sir. Douglas and Mortimer are there. 
###ARCHBISHOP
No, Mortimer isn’t there. 
###SIR MICHAEL
But Mordake is there, and Vernon, and Harry Percy, and Worcester and a slew of brave warriors and excellent men. 
###ARCHBISHOP
That’s correct. But the King has pulled together the best men in the country: the Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, the noble Westmoreland, warlike Blunt, and many other acquaintances and valuable men of good reputation, with great skill in battle. 
###SIR MICHAEL
No doubt they will face great opposition. 
###ARCHBISHOP
I hope so, but still I’m afraid. Now hurry, Sir Michael, to prevent an absolute disaster. For if Percy doesn’t prevail, the King will come after us before he disbands his army. He’s heard that we’re part of the rebellion, so we’d be wise to prepare against him. Now hurry. I have to go write to more friends. Farewell, Sir Michael. 
##They exit.
##The KING, PRINCE HENRY of Wales, Lord John of LANCASTER, Earl of WESTMORELAND, Sir Walter BLUNT, and FALSTAFF enter.
###KING
How bloody the sun looks as it peers over that massive hill. The day looks pale—it must be sick to see the sun in such a mood. 
###PRINCE HENRY
The southern wind is playing its trumpet, to announce to the world what the sun means. And judging by the whistling leaves, it’s going to be a stormy, windy day. 
###KING
Then let it take the losers' side. To winners, nothing seems unpleasant. 
##A trumpet sounds. WORCESTER and VERNON enter.
Hello there, my lord of Worcester! It isn’t right that you and I are meeting under these circumstances. You have betrayed my trust. You forced me to put aside my comfortable peacetime clothing and instead have made me crush my old body into hard, military armor. That isn’t right, sir, that isn’t right. What do you have to say about it? Will you untie this ill-tempered knot of hateful war? Will you return to my loyalty? When you circled me, your King, in your obedient orbit, you shone beautifully and naturally. Now you blaze like a comet: a fearful omen, and a signal that evil will be released into the future. 
###WORCESTER
Listen, my lord. For me, I would love nothing more than to spend my old age in peace and quiet. I protest: I did not seek out this day of aggression. 
###KING
You did not seek it? Then how did it come here? 
###FALSTAFF
Rebellion was standing in front of him, and he bumped into it. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Quiet, you chatterer, quiet! 
###WORCESTER
(to the KING) Your Highness chose to turn your back on me and my family. I must remind you, sir, that we were your first and dearest friends. For you, I quit my position under Richard, and ran day and night to meet you on the road and kiss your hand. At that time, you were far less powerful than I was. But my brother, his son, and I brought you home and ignored the danger. At Doncaster you swore an oath to us that you were not going to challenge the King; all you wanted was your late father’s estate, the dukedom of Lancaster, and in this we promised to help you. But soon, good luck began to pour on you like rain, and a flood of greatness fell upon you. You had a swarm of advantages: you had our assistance; and the King had been away so long; and the country was suffering under violence; and you seemed to have been so grievously wronged; and difficult winds were keeping 
Richard so long in those unlucky Irish wars, people thought he was dead. You seized the opportunity, and used the general feeling to your advantage. You forgot the oath you swore to us at Doncaster. We nourished you, but you used us, like the cuckoo bird uses the sparrow: you settled in our nest, ate our food, and as you grew, you crowded us out. We loved you, but we couldn’t even come near you, for fear that you’d swallow us up. For our own safety, we were forced to run away and secretly raise this army. And now we stand with it, armed with powers that you yourself have caused to stand against you. You treated us poorly, you looked at us with anger, and you broke the faith and trust you swore to us when you were younger. 
###KING
You’ve said all this already. You’ve announced it in marketplaces, given sermons on it in churches. You’ve tried to make rebellion look pleasant in the eyes of all the fickle turncoats and poor malcontents, who laugh and clap eagerly at the news that a revolution is coming. But rebellion always trades in these kinds of thin excuses, and never lacks angry beggars, desperate for mayhem and chaos. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Both our armies are full of men who will make the ultimate sacrifice in this battle, once it starts. Tell your nephew that the Prince of Wales joins the whole world 
in praising Henry Percy. Except for his current endeavor, I don’t think there’s a man alive who is braver, more heroic, more daring, or more bold. As for me, I’m ashamed to admit that I’ve shirked my responsibilities. I hear that he agrees with me on that point. And yet—and I say this in front of my father—in order to avoid casualties on both sides, I want to challenge him in hand-to-hand combat. And I’m content to admit that, based on his good name and reputation, he’s the favorite to win. 
###KING
Prince of Wales, I’d support that idea, except that there are countless reasons why I shouldn’t. No, Worcester, no. I love my subjects, even those who have mistakenly followed your nephew’s lead. If they accept our pardon, then he, you, and they will all be my friends again, and I’ll be theirs. Tell your nephew this, and bring back his answer. But if he doesn’t surrender, he will be rebuked and harshly punished. So, be gone. I don’t want to hear anymore from you now. I offer a fair deal; I advise you to accept it. 
## WORCESTER and VERNON exit.
###PRINCE HENRY
He won’t accept. I’ll bet my life on it. Douglas and Hotspur are convinced that they could take on the whole world together. 
###KING
Then everyone get to their battalions. As soon as they respond, we’ll attack. May God be with us. Our cause is just! 
##Everyone exits except PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF.
###FALSTAFF
Hal, if you see me fall in battle, stand over me, like this. It would be an act of friendship. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Only a giant could do you that friendship. Say your prayers, and farewell. 
###FALSTAFF
I wish it were bedtime, Hal, and everything were okay. 
###PRINCE HENRY
But you owe God a death. 
## PRINCE HENRY exits.
###FALSTAFF
It’s not due yet. I’d hate to pay him before the due date. Why should I be so eager to pay him before he even asks for it? Well, it doesn’t matter: honor spurs me on. Yeah, but what if honor spurs me off once I’m on, and picks me out to die? What happens then? Can honor set a broken leg? No. Or an arm? No. Can it make a wound stop hurting? No. Honor can’t perform surgery, then? No. What is honor? A word. What is in that word, “honor?” What is that “honor?” Air. Quite a bargain! Who has it? A guy who died last Wednesday. Does he feel it? No. Does he hear it? No. It can’t be detected, then? Right—not by the dead, anyway. But won’t it live with the living? No. Why? Slander won’t allow it. That’s why I don’t want any part of it. Honor is nothing more than a gravestone, and that concludes my catechism. 
##He exits.
## WORCESTER and Sir Richard VERNON enter.
###WORCESTER
Oh no, Sir Richard, my nephew cannot be told about the generous and kind offer the King made. 
###VERNON
But he should be told. 
###WORCESTER
It will be the end of all of us! There is absolutely no way that the King will keep his word and trust us again. He will always be wary of us. He’ll find other reasons to punish us for this rebellion. For the rest of our lives he and his loyalists will look on us with suspicion. Treason is like a fox: you can tame it, care for it, and put it in a cage, but it will always have the wild instincts it inherited from its ancestors. No matter how we look—sad or happy—people will interpret our looks in the worst possible light. We’ll be like oxen in a stall: the better they’re fed, the closer they are to being slaughtered. My nephew’s disloyalty might be forgiven: his young age and hot temper will excuse it. Plus, his nickname gives him permission: Hotspur the Harebrain, always flaring up. All his offenses will be blamed on me and his father. After all, we encouraged him, and since we taught him to be angry at the King, we’ll pay for it. So cousin, don’t by any means let Harry know what the King offered. 
###VERNON
Tell him what you want, and I’ll back you up. 
## HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS enter.
Here comes your nephew. 
###HOTSPUR
My uncle’s back. Free Westmoreland, his hostage. Uncle, what’s happening? 
###WORCESTER
The King will beckon you to battle shortly. 
###DOUGLAS
Have Westmoreland deliver your message of defiance. 
###HOTSPUR
Douglas, go tell him to do that. 
###DOUGLAS
Indeed, I will, and gladly. 
## DOUGLAS exits.
###WORCESTER
The King doesn’t appear willing to forgive us. 
###HOTSPUR
Did you ask him to? God forbid! 
###WORCESTER
I politely told him what our issues were. I accused him of breaking his promise to us, and here’s how he answered: he lied about the fact that he lied. He called us rebels, traitors, and said he’d punish us with his mighty army. 
## DOUGLAS enters.
###DOUGLAS
Get your weapons, gentlemen, get your weapons! I sent King Henry a brave and defiant message, and Westmoreland, who was our hostage, will deliver it. This will surely bring the battle on immediately. 
###WORCESTER
The Prince of Wales stepped forward, nephew, and challenged you to a one-on-one fight. 
###HOTSPUR
Oh, I wish the whole battle were between us, and that the only people who would lose their breath today would be me and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me, what was the tone of his challenge? Did he show contempt for me? 
###VERNON
No, I swear; I never heard a challenge issued more gracefully. It was like a brother asking a brother to a little friendly competition. He paid you all due respect, and he summed up your good qualities in the most princely language. He spoke of how deserving you are, as though he were your biographer. He claimed you were even above praise, for simple praise could never measure up to your true merits. And he gave a modest account of himself, as well, which made him seem like a true prince indeed. He berated himself for having behaved wildly, but he said this so gracefully that he sounded like a teacher giving a lesson and a student learning one at the same time. There he stopped, but let me say this: if he survives this battle, then England never had a sweeter hope, nor one so misunderstood in his recklessness. 
###HOTSPUR
I think you’ve been charmed by his foolishness. I’ve never heard of a Prince who was so wild and loose. But however he wants to seem, before night falls I will embrace him with these soldier’s arms, and he will tremble at my affection. Get ready, get ready quickly! And friends, partners, soldiers, take a moment to think for yourselves about what you have to do. I’m not a good enough speaker to motivate you. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
My lord, I have some letters for you. 
###HOTSPUR
I can’t read them now. Oh, gentlemen, life is short. But if you spend that brief time shamefully, you are wasting your time: even if life lasted only an hour, it would still be too long. If we live, it will be in triumph over kings. If we die, it will be a glorious death, since princes will die with us. As for our consciences, our battle is fair: it’s right to bear arms when the cause is just. 
##Another MESSENGER enters.
###SECOND MESSENGER
My lord, get ready. The King has launched his attack. 
###HOTSPUR
I thank him for cutting off my speech, since I have no talent for speaking. Only one more thing: each man should do his best, and with that I will draw my sword. On this dangerous day, I intend to stain it with the best blood I can find. “Hope is my comfort!” Percy! Let’s go! Sound all the imposing instruments of battle, and let’s embrace one another to the tune of that music. For, by heaven, some of us will never be able to do that again. 
##They embrace. The trumpets sound.
##They exit.
##The KING crosses the stage with his army. The trumpets sound the call to battle.
## DOUGLAS and Sir Walter BLUNT enter. BLUNT is disguised as the KING 
###BLUNT
What is your name—you, who are attacking me like this? What honor do you think you’ll get by fighting me? 
###DOUGLAS
My name is Douglas, and I’m haunting you in this battle because they tell me you are a king. 
###BLUNT
They tell you the truth. 
###DOUGLAS
Today, Lord Stafford paid for resembling you so well, for instead of you, King Harry, my sword killed him. Now it will kill you, unless you surrender as my prisoner. 
###BLUNT
I was not born to surrender, you arrogant Scotsman. You’re about to see a king take revenge for Stafford’s death. 
##They fight. DOUGLAS kills BLUNT. HOTSPUR enters.
###HOTSPUR
Oh, Douglas! If you’d fought like this at Holmedon, I would never have been able to beat you. 
###DOUGLAS
It’s over, we’ve won: here’s the King, dead. 
###HOTSPUR
Where? 
###DOUGLAS
Here. 
###HOTSPUR
This, Douglas? No. I know this man: he was a brave knight, by the name of Blunt; he is disguised as the King. 
###DOUGLAS
(to BLUNT) Wherever your soul is off to now, let it carry the name of fool! You paid too much for that borrowed title. Why did you tell me you were a king? 
###HOTSPUR
The King has many men on the battlefield disguised in his uniform. 
###DOUGLAS
Now, I swear on my sword, I’ll kill all his uniforms! I’ll murder every item of his clothing, one piece at a time, until I find the King himself. 
###HOTSPUR
Get going! Our side looks like it will win today. 
##They exit.
##The trumpets play a call to arms.FALSTAFF enters, alone.
###FALSTAFF
I could always escape shot-free in London, but I’m scared of getting shot out here. Here, you take it on the head. Wait a minute—who’s this? Sir Walter Blunt! There’s honor for you, but no vanity! I’m as hot as molten lead, and as heavy, too; so God keep the lead out of me. I don’t need any lead bullets in my belly—my own guts are heavy enough. My army of ragged bums has been massacred. Not even three of my hundred-fifty troops are still alive, and the ones who are have run away, to panhandle in the streets. Who’s coming? 
## PRINCE HENRY enters.
###PRINCE HENRY
What, are you standing here doing nothing? Give me your sword. Many good men are lying cold and dead on the ground, with the enemy’s horses galloping over them. Their deaths have not been revenged. Come, give me your sword. 
###FALSTAFF
Oh, Hal, please, give me a moment to catch my breath. No one has ever fought as heroically as I did today. I’ve killed Percy, I’ve made him safe. 
###PRINCE HENRY
You’re right; he’s safe, and now he’s coming to kill you. Now please, give me your sword. 
###FALSTAFF
No, Hal, I swear to God! If Percy’s alive, you’re not taking my sword. But you can have my gun, if you want. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Give it to me. Is it in its holster? 
###FALSTAFF
Yup. It’s hot, hot; it could sack a city. ( PRINCE HENRY opens the holster and finds a bottle of white wine) 
###PRINCE HENRY
Is this a time to joke and fool around? 
##He throws the bottle at FALSTAFF.
## PRINCE HENRY exits.
###FALSTAFF
If Percy’s alive, I’ll pierce him. If he runs into me, fine. If he doesn’t run into me, but I run into him, let him slice me like a butcher. I don’t want the kind of honor Sir Walter has: give me life. If I manage to save my life, fine. If not, I’ll have honor that I never looked for, and that’ll be that. 
##He exits.
##Trumpets sound battle calls. Soldiers skirmish. The KING, PRINCE HENRY, injured and bleeding, Lord John of LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND enter.
###KING
Please, Harry, get out of here: you’re bleeding too heavily. John of Lancaster, go with him. 
###LANCASTER
I won’t leave, my lord, unless I am bleeding too. 
###PRINCE HENRY
I beg your highness, advance. Your army will lose heart if it sees you falling back. 
###KING
I will. My Lord of Westmoreland, take him to his tent. 
###WESTMORELAND
(to PRINCE HENRY) Come, my lord. I’ll lead you to your tent. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Lead me, my lord? I don’t need your help. God forbid that a shallow scratch could make the Prince of Wales retreat from a battlefield like this one, where great men are falling and being trampled upon, and rebels are triumphing in their massacres! 
###LANCASTER
We’ve stopped for too long. Come, Westmoreland. We have work to do. For God’s sake, come on! 
## LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND exit.
###PRINCE HENRY
By God, you have deceived me, Lancaster. I didn’t think you were that brave. Before, I loved you as a brother; now, I respect you as my soulmate. 
###KING
He had Percy cornered, and he carried himself more bravely than I would have expected of such a young warrior. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Oh, this boy lends us all courage! 
## PRINCE HENRY exits.
## DOUGLAS enters.
###DOUGLAS
Another king! The more of them we kill, the more of them spring up. I am Douglas, and I bring death to everyone wearing that uniform. Who are you, disguised as a king? 
###KING
The King himself. And it pains me, Douglas, that you ran into so many of my shadows, and not me. I have two sons on the field, looking for Percy and for you. But, since you were lucky enough to come upon me, I’ll fight you myself. Defend yourself. 
###DOUGLAS
I fear that you’re another fake; and yet, you bear yourself like a king. Whoever you are, you’re mine, and I’ll defeat you. 
##They fight. The KING begins to lose. PRINCE HENRY of Wales enters.
###PRINCE HENRY
Look at me, you nasty Scotsman, or you’ll never look at anything again. I have the spirits of brave Shirley, Stafford, and Blunt in me. It is the Prince of Wales who threatens you, and I never make promises I cannot keep. 
##They fight.DOUGLAS runs away.
Cheer up, father. How are you? Sir Nicholas Gawsey called for reinforcements, and so has Clifton. I’m going to Clifton right now. 
###KING
Wait, and breathe for a moment. You have redeemed your bad reputation, and show that you care something for me, by rescuing me like this. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Oh God! Anyone who ever said I wished for you to die did me a terrible wrong. If I wanted that, I would have let Douglas continue his attack. That would have killed you faster than any dose of poison, and it would have saved me the trouble of treachery. 
###KING
Go to Clifton; I’ll go to Sir Nicholas Gawsey. 
##The KING exits.
## HOTSPUR enters.
###HOTSPUR
If I’m not mistaken, you’re Harry Monmouth. 
###PRINCE HENRY
You make it sound as if I’d deny it. 
###HOTSPUR
My name is Harry Percy. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Why then, I’m looking at a very brave rebel by that name. I am the Prince of Wales, and don’t think, Percy, that you can share in my glory any longer. There isn’t enough room for two stars in the same orbit; England cannot handle a double reign, Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales ruling at once. 
###HOTSPUR
It won’t have to, Harry, for the time has come for one of us to die. I only wish that you had as great a reputation in warfare as I do. 
###PRINCE HENRY
My reputation will be greater by the time we part. I’ll take all the flowers of honor from your helmet, and turn them into a garland for myself. 
###HOTSPUR
I can’t stand your arrogance any longer. 
##They fight.
## FALSTAFF enters.
###FALSTAFF
Well said, Hal! Go for it, Hal! This isn’t child’s play, I’ll tell you that much! 
## DOUGLAS returns and fights with FALSTAFF, who falls down and plays dead.
## DOUGLAS exits.
## PRINCE HENRY kills HOTSPUR 
###HOTSPUR
Oh, Harry, you’ve taken away my youth. I can handle the loss of my fragile life, but not the loss of all the honors you have won from me: that loss wounds my thoughts more than your sword wounds my flesh. But thought depends on life, and life depends on time, and time, which watches over the whole world, must stop eventually. Oh, I could make prophecies, but the cold hand of death is stopping my tongue. No, Percy. You are dust, and food for—(he dies) 
###PRINCE HENRY
For worms, brave Percy. Farewell, brave soul. Your ambition, aimed at evil, ends—look at how withered it has become. When this body contained a soul, an entire kingdom was too small to hold it. But now, two paces of wretched earth is plenty of room. The ground that you lie dead upon doesn’t have a single living man upon it as brave as you. If you could hear me, I wouldn’t praise you so lavishly. But let me cover your battered face with part of my uniform. I’ll thank myself on your behalf for doing these rites of respect. Adieu, and take my praise of you to heaven. Let your disgraces sleep with you in the grave, and let them be kept off your tombstone! 
##He sees FALSTAFF lying on the ground.
What? My old friend? Couldn’t all this flesh hold onto a little life? Poor Jack, farewell. I would rather have lost a more valuable soldier. If I were in love with vanity, I’d really miss you. Death hasn’t taken anyone as fat today, though it has taken many better men in this vicious battle. I’ll have you embowelled soon; till then, lie here in blood, by the great Percy. 
## PRINCE HENRY exits.
## FALSTAFF stands up.
###FALSTAFF
Embowelled? If you cut me open today, I’ll let you pickle me and eat me tomorrow. Damn! I had to fake 
being dead, or that raging rebel of a Scotsman would have ended me. Fake? No, I tell a lie: I’m not a faker. To die is to be a faker, because a dead body is an imitation of a living one. But to fake being dead, in order to stay alive, that’s no kind of faking. That’s the truest kind of living there is. Bravery is mostly about precaution; I’m careful, and it saved my life. Damn, I’m scared of this bombshell Percy, even though he’s dead. What if he’s faking, too, and he gets up? I swear, he’d be the better faker. Therefore, I’ll make sure he’s dead; in fact, I’ll swear that I killed him. Why couldn’t he just get up, like I did? Only a witness could stop me, and there are no witnesses here. Therefore, sirrah, (stabs the body)you’re coming with me—complete with a new wound in your thigh. (he throws HOTSPUR’s body over his shoulder) 
## PRINCE HENRY and Lord John of LANCASTER enter.
###PRINCE HENRY
John, my brother, you’ve bravely proven yourself in this, your first battle. 
###LANCASTER
Wait! Who do we have here? Didn’t you say this fat man was dead? 
###PRINCE HENRY
I did. I saw him dead on the ground, bleeding and not breathing. Are you alive? Or is this some kind of dream, playing with our sight? Talk to us. We won’t trust our eyes without our ears. You aren’t what you seem to be. 
###FALSTAFF
That’s for sure. I’m not a double man. But if I’m not Jack Falstaff, then I’m a crook. Here’s Percy. If the king will honor me for this, fine. If not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I expect to me made an earl or a Duke for this, I’ll tell you that much. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Why, I killed Percy myself and I saw you dead. 
###FALSTAFF
You did? Lord, Lord, how people love to lie! I admit I had fallen and was out of breath, and so was he. But we both stood up at the same time and fought for a long hour. If I am to be believed, fine. If I’m not believed, then the guilt will lie with the people who are supposed to reward bravery. I swear on my life, I gave him this gash in the leg. Damn, if he were alive and said I didn’t, I’d shove my sword down his throat. 
###LANCASTER
This is the strangest story I’ve ever heard. 
###PRINCE HENRY
This is the strangest man, John. All right then, display your prize on your back. As far as I’m concerned, if lying will help you out, I’ll decorate your lie as prettily as I can. 
##A trumpet blows a call of retreat.
A trumpet is blowing retreat: we’ve won. Come on, brother. Let’s get to high ground and see which of our friends are alive, and which are dead. 
## PRINCE HENRY and Lord John of LANCASTER exit.
###FALSTAFF
I’ll follow them and claim my reward. May God reward whoever rewards me. If I grow into a great man, I’ll grow thinner: I’ll go on a diet, quit drinking, and live properly, like a great man should. 
##He exits.
##Trumpets sound. The KING, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND enter, with WORCESTER and VERNON as prisoners.
###KING
This is how rebellions always end—defeated. Evil-spirited Worcester! Didn’t I offer kindness, forgiveness and friendship to all of you? And you pretended that I did the opposite? Your relatives and friends trusted you, yet you lied to them? Three of our knights who were killed today, a noble earl, and many other men might have been alive right now if you had been a decent man and reported truthfully on the negotiations between our two armies. 
###WORCESTER
I did what I had to do for the sake of my own well-being. I accept my fate patiently, since there’s no way I can avoid it. 
###KING
Put Worcester to death, and Vernon too: I’ll wait a while before I decide what to do about the others. 
## WORCESTER and VERNON are escorted away by guards.
What’s happening on the battlefield? 
###PRINCE HENRY
When that brave Scotsman, Lord Douglas, saw that things were turning against him, that Percy had been killed, and that his men were fleeing in terror, he ran away too. He fell down a hill and was so badly injured that our men were able to capture him. He’s being held prisoner at my tent. I ask your highness to let me decide what to do with him. 
###KING
With all my heart. 
###PRINCE HENRY
Brother, John of Lancaster, I’m going to give you the honor of this generous act. Go to Douglas and set him free, with no ransom due. Let him do whatever he wants. His brave fighting against us today should be valued, even though he was our enemy. 
###LANCASTER
Thank you for giving me this honor. I’ll take care of it immediately. 
###KING
All that’s left is for us to split up our armies. You, my son John, and you, Westmoreland, head towards York as quickly as you can. Confront Northumberland and that churchman the Archbishop, who, I gather, are raising armies against us. You and I, Harry my son, will head for Wales to fight Glendower and Mortimer. The rebellion in this land will break apart once it meets battles like the one we fought today. And since we have accomplished our business so well, let’s not quit until everything has been won. 
##They exit.

## BARNARDO and FRANCISCO, two watchmen, enter.
###BARNARDO
Who’s there? 
###FRANCISCO
No, who are you? Stop and identify yourself. 
###BARNARDO
Long live the king! 
###FRANCISCO
Is that Barnardo? 
###BARNARDO
Yes, it’s me. 
###FRANCISCO
You’ve come right on time. 
###BARNARDO
The clock’s just striking twelve. Go home to bed, Francisco. 
###FRANCISCO
Thanks for letting me go. It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed. 
###BARNARDO
Has it been a quiet night? 
###FRANCISCO
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak. 
###BARNARDO
Well, good night. If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry. 
###FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. —Stop! Who’s there? 
## MARCELLUS and HORATIO enter.
###HORATIO
Friends of this country. 
###MARCELLUS
And servants of the Danish king. 
###FRANCISCO
Good night to you both. 
###MARCELLUS
Good-bye. Who’s taken over the watch for you? 
###FRANCISCO
Barnardo’s taken my place. Good night. 
## FRANCISCO exits.
###MARCELLUS
Hello, Barnardo. 
###BARNARDO
Hello. Is Horatio here too? 
###HORATIO
More or less. 
###BARNARDO
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, Marcellus. 
###MARCELLUS
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight? 
###BARNARDO
I haven’t seen anything. 
###MARCELLUS
Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now. That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it. 
###HORATIO
Oh, nonsense. It’s not going to appear. 
###BARNARDO
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now. 
###HORATIO
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us. 
###BARNARDO
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— 
##The GHOST enters.
###MARCELLUS
Quiet, shut up! It’s come again. 
###BARNARDO
Looking just like the dead king. 
###MARCELLUS
(to HORATIO) You’re well-educated, Horatio. Say something to it. 
###BARNARDO
Doesn’t he look like the king, Horatio? 
###HORATIO
Very much so. It’s terrifying. 
###BARNARDO
It wants us to speak to it. 
###MARCELLUS
Ask it something, Horatio. 
###HORATIO
What are you, that you walk out so late at night, looking like the dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle? By God, I order you to speak. 
###MARCELLUS
It looks like you’ve offended it. 
###BARNARDO
Look, it’s going away. 
###HORATIO
Stay! Speak! Speak! I order you, speak! 
##The GHOST exits.
###MARCELLUS
It’s gone. It won’t answer now. 
###BARNARDO
What’s going on, Horatio? You’re pale and trembling. You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you? What do you think about it? 
###HORATIO
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it. 
###MARCELLUS
Doesn’t it look like the king? 
###HORATIO
Yes, as much as you look like yourself. The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway. And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds. It’s weird. 
###MARCELLUS
It’s happened like this twice before, always at this exact time. He stalks by us at our post like a warrior. 
###HORATIO
I don’t know exactly how to explain this, but I have a general feeling this means bad news for our country. 
###MARCELLUS
All right, let’s sit down and discuss that question. Somebody tell me why this strict schedule of guards has been imposed, and why so many bronze cannons are being manufactured in Denmark, and so many weapons bought from abroad, and why the shipbuilders are so busy they don’t even rest on Sunday. Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day? Who can explain this to me? 
###HORATIO
I can. Or at least I can describe the rumors. As you know, our late king, whom we just now saw as a ghost, was the great rival of Fortinbras, king of Norway. Fortinbras dared him to battle. In that fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that’s how we thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who—on the basis of a valid legal document—surrendered all his territories, along with his life, to his conqueror. If our king had lost, he would have had to do the same. But now old Fortinbras’s young son, also called Fortinbras—he is bold, but unproven—has gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country. For some food, they’re eager to take on the tough enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost. 
As far as I understand, that’s why we’re posted here tonight and why there’s such a commotion in Denmark lately. 
###BARNARDO
I think that’s exactly right—that explains why the ghost of the late king would haunt us now, since he caused these wars. 
###HORATIO
The ghost is definitely something to worry about. In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish. There were shooting stars, and blood mixed in with the morning dew, and threatening signs on the face of the sun. The moon, which controls the tides of the sea, was so eclipsed it almost went completely out. And we’ve had similar omens of terrible things to come, as if heaven and earth have joined together to warn us what’s going to happen. 
##The GHOST enters.
Wait, look! It has come again. I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do. —Stay here, you hallucination! 
##The GHOST spreads his arms.
If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me. 
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me. If you have some secret knowledge of your country’s sad fate—which might be avoided if we knew about it—then, please, speak. Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it. Stay and speak! 
##A rooster crows.
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus. 
###MARCELLUS
Should I strike it with my spear? 
###HORATIO
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still. 
###BARNARDO
It’s over here. 
###HORATIO
There it is. 
##The GHOST exits.
###MARCELLUS
It’s gone. We were wrong to threaten it with violence, since it looks so much like a king. Besides, we can’t hurt it anymore than we can hurt the air. Our attack was stupid, futile, and wicked. 
###BARNARDO
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed. 
###HORATIO
And then it acted startled, like a guilty person caught by the law. I’ve heard that the rooster awakens the god of day with its trumpetlike crowing, and makes all wandering ghosts, wherever they are, hurry back to their hiding places. We’ve just seen proof of that. 
###MARCELLUS
Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed. Some people say that just before Christmas the rooster crows all night long, so that no ghost dares go wandering, and the night is safe. The planets have no sway over us, fairies' spells don’t work, and witches can’t bewitch us. That’s how holy that night is. 
###HORATIO
Yes, I’ve heard the same thing and sort of believe it. But look, morning is breaking beyond that hill in the east, turning the sky red. Let’s interrupt our watch and go tell young Hamlet what we’ve seen tonight. I’m sure this ghost that’s so silent with us will speak to him. Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love? 
###MARCELLUS
Let’s do it. I know where we’ll find him this morning. 
##They exit.
## CLAUDIUS, the king of Denmark, enters, along with GERTRUDE the queen, HAMLET, POLONIUS, POLONIUS ’s son LAERTES and daughter OPHELIA, and LORDS who wait on the king.
###CLAUDIUS
Although I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder Hamlet’s death, and though it was proper to mourn him throughout our kingdom, life still goes on—I think it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own well being. Therefore, I’ve married my former sister-in-law, the queen, with mixed feelings of happiness and sadness. I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing what all of you have wisely advised all along—for which I thank you. Now, down to business. You all know what’s happening. Young Fortinbras, underestimating my strength or imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into turmoil, dreams of getting the better of me, and never stops pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father lost to the elder Hamlet, my dead brother-in-law. So much for Fortinbras. 
## VOLTEMAND and CORNELIUS enter.
Now, here’s what needs to be done. 
I’ve written to Fortinbras’s uncle, the present head of Norway, an old bedridden man who knows next to nothing about his nephew’s plans. I’ve told the uncle to stop those plans, which he has the power to do, since all the troops assembled by young Fortinbras are Norwegian, and thus under the uncle’s control. I’m giving the job of delivering this letter to you, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand. Your business in Norway will be limited to this task. (he gives them a paper) Now good-bye. Show your loyalty by leaving quickly, rather than with elaborate speeches. 
###CORNELIUS, VOLTEMAND
We’ll do our duty to you in that and everything else. 
###CLAUDIUS
I have no doubt you will. Good-bye. 
## CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND exit.
And now, Laertes, what do you have to tell me? You have a favor you to ask of me. What is it, Laertes? You’ll never waste your words when talking to the king of Denmark. What could you ever ask for that I wouldn’t give you? Your father and the Danish throne are as close as the mind and the heart, or the hand and the mouth. What would you like, Laertes? 
###LAERTES
My lord, I want your permission to go back to France, which I left to come to Denmark for your coronation. I confess, my thoughts are on France, now that my duty is done. Please, let me go. 
###CLAUDIUS
Do you have your father’s permission? What does Polonius say? 
###POLONIUS
My son has worn me down by asking me so many times. In the end I grudgingly consented. I beg you, let him go. 
###CLAUDIUS
In that case, leave when you like, Laertes, and spend your time however you wish. I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time. And now, Hamlet, my nephew and my son— 
###HAMLET
(speaking so no one else can hear) Too many family ties there for me. 
###CLAUDIUS
Why are you still so gloomy, with a cloud hanging over you? 
###HAMLET
It’s not true, sir. Your son is out in the sun. 
###GERTRUDE
My dear Hamlet, stop wearing these black clothes, and be friendly to the king. You can’t spend your whole life with your eyes to the ground remembering your noble father. It happens all the time, what lives must die eventually, passing to eternity. 
###HAMLET
Yes, mother, it happens all the time. 
###GERTRUDE
So why does it seem so particular to you? 
###HAMLET
“Seem,” mother? No, it is. I don’t know what you mean by “seem.” Neither my black clothes, my dear mother, nor my heavy sighs, nor my weeping, nor my downcast eyes, nor any other display of grief can show what I really feel. It’s true that all these things “seem” like grief, since a person could use them to fake grief if he wanted to. But I’ve got more real grief inside me that you could ever see on the surface. These clothes are just a hint of it. 
###CLAUDIUS
Hamlet, you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father like this. But you have to remember, that your father lost his father, who lost his father before him, and every time, each son has had to mourn his father for a certain period. But overdoing it is just stubborn. It’s not manly. It’s not what God wants, and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and weak mind. Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later, why should we take it to heart? You’re committing a crime against heaven, against the dead, and against nature. And it’s irration-al, since the truth is that all fathers must die. Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father. 
Because everyone knows that you are the man closest to this throne, and I love you just as much as any father loves his son. And your plans for going back to Wittenberg are not what I want. I’m asking you now to stay here in my company as the number-one member of my court, my nephew and now my son too. 
###GERTRUDE
Please answer my prayers, Hamlet, and stay with us. Don’t go back to Wittenberg. 
###HAMLET
I’ll obey you as well as I can, ma'am. 
###CLAUDIUS
That’s the right answer—it shows your love. Stay in Denmark like us.—My dear wife, come. Hamlet’s agreeing to stay makes me happy, and every merry toast I’ll drink today will be heard as far as the clouds overhead. My drinking will be echoed in the heavens. Let’s go. 
##Trumpets play. Everyone except HAMLET exits.
###HAMLET
Ah, I wish my dirty flesh could melt away into a vapor, or that God had not made a law against suicide. Oh God, God! How tired, stale, and pointless life is to me. Damn it! It’s like a garden that no one’s taking care of, and that’s growing wild. Only nasty weeds grow in it now. I can’t believe it’s come to this. My father’s only been dead for two months—no, not even two. Such an excellent king, as superior to my uncle as a god is to a beast, and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind from blowing too hard on her face. 
Oh God, do I have to remember that? She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him. Yet even so, within a month of my father’s death (I don’t even want to think about it. Oh women! You are so weak!), even before she had broken in the shoes she wore to his funeral, crying like crazy—even an animal would have mourned its mate longer than she did!—there she was marrying my uncle, my father’s brother, who’s about as much like my father as I’m like Hercules. Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried. Oh, so quick to jump into a bed of incest! That’s not good, and no good can come of it either. But my heart must break in silence, since I can’t mention my feelings aloud. 
## HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BARNARDO enter.
###HORATIO
Hello, sir. 
###HAMLET
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right? 
###HORATIO
That’s me, sir. Still your respectful servant. 
###HAMLET
Not my servant, but my friend. I’ll change that name for you. But what are you doing so far from Wittenberg, Horatio? —Oh, Marcellus? 
###MARCELLUS
Hello, sir. 
###HAMLET
(to MARCELLUS) So nice to see you.—(to BARNARDO) Hello, sir.(to HORATIO)—But what are you doing away from Wittenberg, Horatio? 
###HORATIO
I felt like skipping school, sir. 
###HAMLET
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you. I know you’d never skip school. What are you doing here in Elsinore? I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave. 
###HORATIO
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral. 
###HAMLET
Please, don’t make fun of me. I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead. 
###HORATIO
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after. 
###HAMLET
It was all about saving a few bucks, Horatio. The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet. Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day! My father—I think I see my father. 
###HORATIO
Where, sir? 
###HAMLET
In my imagination, Horatio. 
###HORATIO
I saw him once. He was an admirable king. 
###HAMLET
He was a great human being. He was perfect in everything. I’ll never see the likes of him again. 
###HORATIO
Sir, I think I saw him last night. 
###HAMLET
Saw who? 
###HORATIO
Your father, sir. The dead king. 
###HAMLET
The king my father?! 
###HORATIO
Don’t get too excited yet, sir. Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses. 
###HAMLET
For God’s sake, let me hear it. 
###HORATIO
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe. It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak. They told me all about this, so on the third night I agreed to come stand guard with them, to see for myself. It happened again, just as they had described. I knew your father. This ghost looked as much like him as my two hands are like each other. 
###HAMLET
But where did this happen? 
###MARCELLUS
On the platform where we stand guard, sir. 
###HAMLET
Didn’t you talk to it? 
###HORATIO
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me. It raised its head once as if it was about to speak, but just then the rooster started crowing, and the ghost vanished from sight. 
###HAMLET
That’s very strange. 
###HORATIO
I swear to God it’s true, sir. We thought you ought to know about it. 
###HAMLET
Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me. Are you on duty again tonight? 
###MARCELLUS, BARNARDO
Yes, sir. 
###HAMLET
It was armed, you say? 
###MARCELLUS, BARNARDO
Armed, sir. 
###HAMLET
From head to toe? 
###MARCELLUS, BARNARDO
Yes, from top to bottom, sir. 
###HAMLET
So you couldn’t see his face, then? 
###HORATIO
Oh, yes, we could, sir. He had his helmet visor up. 
###HAMLET
Was he frowning? 
###HORATIO
He looked more sad than angry. 
###HAMLET
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced? 
###HORATIO
Very pale, sir. 
###HAMLET
Did he stare at you? 
###HORATIO
The whole time. 
###HAMLET
I wish I’d been there. 
###HORATIO
You would have been very shocked. 
###HAMLET
I’m sure I would have. Did it stay a long time? 
###HORATIO
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred. 
###MARCELLUS, BARNARDO
No, longer than that. 
###HORATIO
Not the time I saw it. 
###HAMLET
His beard was gray, right? 
###HORATIO
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it. 
###HAMLET
I’ll stand guard with you tonight. Maybe it’ll come again. 
###HORATIO
I bet it will. 
###HAMLET
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet. I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so. Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it. I’ll return the favor. So good-bye for now. I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight. 
###HORATIO, MARCELLUS, BARNARDO
We’ll do our duty to you, sir. 
###HAMLET
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine. Good-bye. 
##Everyone except HAMLET exits.
My father’s ghost—armed! Something’s wrong. I suspect some foul play. I wish the night were here already! Until then, I have to remain calm. Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them. 
## HAMLET exits.
## LAERTES and his sister OPHELIA enter.
###LAERTES
My belongings are on the ship already. Good-bye. And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write. 
###OPHELIA
Do you doubt I’ll write? 
###LAERTES
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth. It won’t last. It’s sweet, but his affection will fade after a minute. Not a second more. 
###OPHELIA
No more than a minute? 
###LAERTES
Try to think of it like that, anyway. When a youth grows into a man, he doesn’t just get bigger in his body—his responsibilities grow too. He may love you now, and may have only the best intentions, but you have to be on your guard. Remember that he belongs to the royal family, and his intentions don’t matter that much—he’s a slave to his family obligations. He can’t simply make personal choices for himself the way common people can, since the whole country depends on what he does. His choice has to agree with what the nation wants. 
So if he says he loves you, you should be wise enough to see that his words only mean as much as the state of Denmark allows them to mean. Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands. Watch out, Ophelia. Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust. Simply exposing your beauty to the moon at night is risky enough—you don’t have to expose yourself to him. Even good girls sometimes get a bad reputation. Worms ruin flowers before they blossom. Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease. So be careful. Fear will keep you safe. Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others. 
###OPHELIA
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart. But, my dear brother, don’t be like a bad priest who fails to practice what he preaches, showing me the steep and narrow way to heaven while you frolic on the primrose path of sin. 
###LAERTES
Don’t worry, I won’t. 
## POLONIUS enters.
I’ve been here too long. And here comes father. What good luck, to have him bless my leaving not once but twice. 
###POLONIUS
You’re still here? Shame on you—get on board! The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you. Here, I give you my blessing again. And just try to remember a few rules of life. Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think. Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it. Once you’ve tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them. But don’t waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet. Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own. Listen to many people, but talk to few. Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment. Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure they’re quality, not flashy, since clothes make the man—which is doubly true in France. Don’t borrow money and don’t lend it, since when you lend to a friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift. And, above all, be true to yourself. Then you won’t be false to anybody else. Good-bye, son. I hope my blessing will help you absorb what I’ve said. 
###LAERTES
I humbly say good-bye to you, father. 
###POLONIUS
Now go, the time is right. Your servants are waiting. 
###LAERTES
Good-bye, Ophelia. Remember what I’ve told you. 
###OPHELIA
It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key. 
###LAERTES
Good-bye. 
## LAERTES exits.
###POLONIUS
What did he tell you, Ophelia? 
###OPHELIA
Something about Hamlet. 
###POLONIUS
A good thing he did, by God. I’ve heard Hamlet’s been spending a lot of time alone with you recently, and you’ve made yourself quite available to him. If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show. What’s going on between you two? Tell me the truth. 
###OPHELIA
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately. 
###POLONIUS
“Affection!” That’s nothing! You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world. Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them? 
###OPHELIA
I don’t know what to believe, father. 
###POLONIUS
Then I’ll tell you. Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real. Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock. 
###OPHELIA
Father, he’s always talked about love in an honorable fashion— 
###POLONIUS
Yes, “fashion” is just the word—a passing whim. Go on. 
###OPHELIA
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says. 
###POLONIUS
These vows are just traps for stupid birds. I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything. But when a heart’s on fire, it gives out more light than heat, and the fire will be out even before he’s done making his promises. Don’t mistake that for true love. From now on, spend a little less time with him and talk to him less. Make yourself a precious commodity. Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do. In short, Ophelia, don’t believe his love vows, since they’re like flashy pimps who wear nice clothes to lead a woman into filthy acts. To put it plainly, don’t waste your time with Hamlet. Do as I say. Now come along. 
###OPHELIA
I’ll do as you say, father. 
##They exit.
## HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS enter.
###HAMLET
The air is biting cold. 
###HORATIO
Yes, it’s definitely nippy. 
###HAMLET
What time is it? 
###HORATIO
A little before twelve, I think. 
###MARCELLUS
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike. 
###HORATIO
Really? I didn’t hear it. So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear. 
##Trumpets play offstage and two cannons are fired.
What does that mean, sir? 
###HAMLET
The king is staying up all night drinking and dancing. As he guzzles down his German wine, the musicians make a ruckus to celebrate his draining another cup. 
###HORATIO
Is that a tradition? 
###HAMLET
Yes, it is. But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it. Other countries criticize us for our loud partying. 
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles. And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations. It’s just like what happens to certain people who have some birth defect (which they are not responsible for, since nobody chooses how he’s born), or some weird habit or compulsion that changes them completely. It happens sometimes that one little defect in these people, as wonderful and talented as they may be, will make them look completely bad to other people. A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations. 
##The GHOST enters.
###HORATIO
Look, sir—here it comes! 
###HAMLET
Oh angels, protect us! Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you. I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me! Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb, 
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again. What could it mean that you have put on your armor again, you corpse, and have come back to look at the moon, making the night terrifying and stirring us humans with supernatural fears? Why? What do you want from us? What should we do? 
##The GHOST motions for HAMLET to come with it.
###HORATIO
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone. 
###MARCELLUS
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away. But don’t go. 
###HORATIO
Definitely not. 
###HAMLET
It’s not going to speak, so I’ll follow it. 
###HORATIO
Don’t do it, sir. 
###HAMLET
Why, what’s the danger? I don’t value my life one bit. And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is? Look, it’s waving me over again. I’ll follow it. 
###HORATIO
What if it tempts you to jump into the sea, sir? Or to the terrifying cliff that overhangs the water, 
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane. Think about it. The edge of the sea makes people feel despair even at the best of times. All they have to do is look into its depths and hear it roar far below. 
###HAMLET
It’s still waving to me. —Go ahead, I’ll follow. 
###MARCELLUS
You’re not going, sir. 
## MARCELLUS and HORATIO try to hold HAMLET back.
###HAMLET
Let go of me. 
###HORATIO
Calm down. You’re not going anywhere. 
###HAMLET
It’s my fate calling me. Every nerve in my body is now as tough as steel. The ghost is still waving me over. Let me go, gentlemen. (he draws his sword) I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him! I say, get away!—Go ahead, I’ll follow you. 
##The GHOST and HAMLET exit.
###HORATIO
His imagination is making him crazy. 
###MARCELLUS
Let’s follow them. It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone. 
###HORATIO
Go ahead and follow him. But what does all this mean, where will it all end? 
###MARCELLUS
It means that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. 
###HORATIO
If that’s true, we should let God take care of it. 
###MARCELLUS
No, let’s follow him. 
##They exit.
##The GHOST and HAMLET enter.
###HAMLET
Where are you taking me? Speak. I’m not going any farther. 
###GHOST
Listen to me. 
###HAMLET
I will. 
###GHOST
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory. 
###HAMLET
Ah, poor ghost! 
###GHOST
Don’t pity me. Just listen carefully to what I have to tell you. 
###HAMLET
Speak. I’m ready to hear you. 
###GHOST
You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out. 
###HAMLET
What? 
###GHOST
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins. If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of purgatory, I could tell you stories that would slice through your soul, freeze your blood, 
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills. But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife. Listen, listen! If you ever loved your poor dear father— 
###HAMLET
Oh God! 
###GHOST
Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature. 
###HAMLET
Murder? 
###GHOST
His most horrible murder. Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural. 
###HAMLET
Hurry and tell me about it, so I can take revenge right away, faster than a person falls in love. 
###GHOST
I’m glad you’re eager. You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of Lethe not to get riled up here. Now listen, Hamlet. Everyone was told that a poisonous snake bit me when I was sleeping in the orchard. But in fact, that’s a lie that’s fooled everyone in Denmark. You should know, my noble son, the real snake that stung your father is now wearing his crown. 
###HAMLET
I knew it! My uncle? 
###GHOST
Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal. With his clever words and fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her to give in to his lust. They were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that! Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell! She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine. But just as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage. But hang on, I think I smell the morning air. So let me be brief here. Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard, as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just what it did to me. I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust. And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once. He cut me off in the middle of a sinful life. 
I had no chance to repent my sins or receive last rites. Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible! If you are human, don’t stand for it. Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest. But however you go about your revenge, don’t corrupt your mind or do any harm to your mother. Leave her to God and her own guilt. Now, good-bye. The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near. Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye. Remember me. 
##The GHOST exits.
###HAMLET
Ah, all you up in heaven! And earth! What else? Shall I include hell as well? Damn it! Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing. Remember you! Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head. Remember you! Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there. Yes, by God! Oh, you evil woman! Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain! Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain. At least it’s possible in Denmark. (he writes) So, uncle, there you are. Now it’s time to deal with the vow I made to my father. 
He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would. 
## MARCELLUS and HORATIO enter.
###HORATIO
Sir, sir! 
###MARCELLUS
Lord Hamlet.— 
###HORATIO
Please let him be all right! 
###HAMLET
I’m all right. 
###HORATIO
Oh-ho-ho, sir! 
###HAMLET
Oh-ho-ho, kid! Come here. 
###MARCELLUS
So how did it go, sir? 
###HORATIO
What happened, sir? 
###HAMLET
It was incredible! 
###HORATIO
Oh, please, tell us, sir. 
###HAMLET
No, you’ll talk. 
###HORATIO
I swear I won’t, sir. 
###MARCELLUS
I won’t either, sir. 
###HAMLET
Okay. But you promise you can keep a secret? 
###HORATIO, MARCELLUS
Yes, I swear. 
###HAMLET
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain. 
###HORATIO
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir. 
###HAMLET
Yes, you’re absolutely right. So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways. You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray. 
###HORATIO
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir. 
###HAMLET
I’m sorry if I offended you; yes, very sorry. 
###HORATIO
Oh, don’t worry about it, sir. No offense taken. 
###HAMLET
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense. As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much. But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you. And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor. 
###HORATIO
What is it, sir? Of course we will. 
###HAMLET
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight. 
###HORATIO, MARCELLUS
We won’t, sir. 
###HAMLET
No, you have to swear it. 
###HORATIO
I swear to God I won’t. 
###MARCELLUS
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God. 
###HAMLET
Swear by my sword. 
###MARCELLUS
But we already swore, sir. 
###HAMLET
Yes, but swear by my sword this time. 
###GHOST
(calls out from under the stage) Swear! 
###HAMLET
Ha ha, is that what you say, kid? Are you down there, my man?—Come on, you hear this guy down in the basement. Agree to swear. 
###HORATIO
Tell us what to swear, sir. 
###HAMLET
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen. Swear by my sword. 
###GHOST
(from under the stage) Swear. 
###HAMLET
You’re everywhere, aren’t you? Maybe we should move. Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again. Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard. 
###GHOST
(from under the stage) Swear by his sword. 
###HAMLET
You said it right, old mole. You’re pretty busy down there in the dirt, aren’t you? What a tunneler! Let’s move again, my friends. 
###HORATIO
My God, this is unbelievably strange. 
###HAMLET
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of. But now listen to me. No matter how strangely I act (since I may find it appropriate to act a little crazy in the near future), you must never, ever let on—with a gesture of your hands or a certain expression on your face—that you know anything about what happened to me here tonight. You must never say anything like, “Ah, yes, just as we suspected,” or “We could tell you a thing or two about him,” or anything like that. Swear you won’t. 
###GHOST
(from under the stage) Swear. 
###HAMLET
Okay, then, unhappy ghost, you can rest now. So, gentlemen, I thank you heartily and with all my love, and I’ll repay you however I can some day. Let’s go back to court together, but shhh, please. No talking about this. There is so much out of whack in these times. And damn the fact that I’m supposed to fix it! Come on, let’s go. 
##They exit.
## POLONIUS enters with his servant REYNALDO.
###POLONIUS
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo. 
###REYNALDO
I will, sir. 
###POLONIUS
It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him. 
###REYNALDO
That’s what I thought too, sir. 
###POLONIUS
Excellent, very good. Ask around and find out what Danish people are in Paris—who they are, where they live and how much money they have, who their friends are. And if you find out in this general sort of questioning that they happen to know my son, you’ll find out much more than if you asked specific questions about him. Just tell them you vaguely know Laertes, say something like, “I’m a friend of his father and I sort of know him,” or whatever. Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo? 
###REYNALDO
Yes, very well, sir. 
###POLONIUS
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well. Is it the same Laertes who’s a wild party animal? Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on. Then just make up whatever you want—of course, nothing so bad that it would shame him. I mean make up any stories that 
sound like your average young guy, the kind of trouble they get into. 
###REYNALDO
Like gambling, sir? 
###POLONIUS
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing. 
###REYNALDO
But that would ruin his reputation! 
###POLONIUS
Oh no, not if you say it right. I don’t want you to say he’s a sex fiend, that’s not what I mean. Just mention his faults lightly, so they make him seem like a free spirit who’s gone a little too far. 
###REYNALDO
But, sir— 
###POLONIUS
Why should you do this, you want to know? 
###REYNALDO
Yes, sir. I’d like to know. 
###POLONIUS
Well, here’s what I’m thinking. (I’m quite proud of myself for coming up with this.) As you talk with someone and hint about my son’s faults and little sins, you’ll watch his reaction, and if he’s ever seen Laertes do any of these things, it will only be natural for him to agree with you, at which point he’ll call you “sir,” or “my good friend,” depending on who the person is, where he comes from, and so on. 
###REYNALDO
Yes, sir. 
###POLONIUS
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say? Good God, I was about to say something. What was I saying? 
###REYNALDO
At, “It will be natural for him to agree with you … he’ll call you ‘sir,’ ‘friend,’” et cetera. 
###POLONIUS
“It will be natural for him to agree with you.” Ah, yes, that’s right. If he agrees he’ll say something like this: “Yes, I know the gentleman you’re referring to. I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever. Make sure your little lie brings out the truth. We’re doing this wisely and intelligently, indirectly, finding out things by roundabout means. That’s how you’ll find out what my son is up to in Paris. You get my point, don’t you? 
###REYNALDO
Yes, I do, sir. 
###POLONIUS
God bless you. Have a safe trip. 
###REYNALDO
Thank you, sir. 
###POLONIUS
Don’t forget to see what he’s up to with your own eyes. Don’t trust gossip. 
###REYNALDO
I will, sir. 
###POLONIUS
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to. 
###REYNALDO
Got it, sir. 
###POLONIUS
Good-bye. 
## REYNALDO exits.
## OPHELIA enters.
Ophelia, what’s the matter? 
###OPHELIA
Oh, father, father, I’ve just had such a scare! 
###POLONIUS
From what, in God’s name? 
###OPHELIA
Father, I was up in my room sewing when Hamlet came in with no hat on his head, his shirt unbuttoned, and his stockings dirty, undone, and down around his ankles. He was pale as his undershirt, and his knees were knocking together. He looked so out of sorts, as if he’d just come back from hell. He came up to me. 
###POLONIUS
Is he crazy with love for you? 
###OPHELIA
I’m not sure, but I’m afraid he might be. 
###POLONIUS
What did he say? 
###OPHELIA
He grabbed me by the wrist and held me hard, then backed away an arm’s length and just looked at me, staring at me like an artist about to paint my picture. He stayed like that a long time. 
Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath. After that he let me go. He left the room with his head turned back on me, finding his way out without looking, since his eyes were on me the whole time. 
###POLONIUS
Come with me. I’ll go tell the king about this. This is definitely love-craziness. Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion. I’m so sorry. Did you tell him anything that might have hurt his feelings lately? 
###OPHELIA
No, father, but I did what you told me to do and sent back his letters and wouldn’t let him visit me. 
###POLONIUS
That’s what made him crazy. I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that. I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation. Damn my suspicious thoughts! It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy. Come on, let’s go see the king. We’ve got to discuss this matter, which could cause more trouble if we keep it secret than if we discuss it openly. 
##They exit.
##Trumpets play. CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE enter with ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and attendants.
###CLAUDIUS
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away. You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before. I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death. Since you both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and spend some time with him. See if you can get Hamlet to have some fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix it. 
###GERTRUDE
Gentlemen, Hamlet’s talked a lot about you, and I know there are no two men alive he’s fonder of. If you’ll be so good as to spend some time with us and help us out, you’ll be thanked on a royal scale. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely. 
###GUILDENSTERN
But we’ll obey. Our services are entirely at your command. 
###CLAUDIUS
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern. 
###GERTRUDE
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz. I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much. Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet. 
###GUILDENSTERN
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good! 
###GERTRUDE
Amen to that! 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit, escorted by attendants.
## POLONIUS enters.
###POLONIUS
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir. 
###CLAUDIUS
Once again you bring good news. 
###POLONIUS
Do I, sir? I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king. 
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy. 
###CLAUDIUS
Tell me! I want very much to find out. 
###POLONIUS
All right, but first let the ambassadors speak. Then you can hear my news, as dessert. 
###CLAUDIUS
Then be so kind as to show them in. 
## POLONIUS exits.
Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity. 
###GERTRUDE
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage. 
## POLONIUS enters with the ambassadors VOLTEMAND and CORNELIUS.
###CLAUDIUS
Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Welcome, my good friends. Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway? 
###VOLTEMAND
Greetings to you too, your Highness. As soon as we raised the matter, the king sent out messengers to stop his nephew’s war preparations, which he originally thought were directed against Poland but learned on closer examination were directed against you. He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest. Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again. 
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand crowns and permission to lead his soldiers into Poland, asking you officially in this letter to allow his troops to pass through your kingdom on their way to Poland. He’s assuring you of your safety. (he gives CLAUDIUS a document 
###CLAUDIUS
I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply. Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts. Go relax now. Tonight we’ll have dinner. Welcome back! 
## VOLTEMAND and CORNELIUS exit.
###POLONIUS
Well, that turned out well in the end. Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time. Therefore, since the essence of wisdom is not talking too much, I’ll get right to the point here. Your son is crazy. “Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness? But that’s another story. 
###GERTRUDE
Please, stick to the point. 
###POLONIUS
Madam, I’m doing nothing but sticking to the point. It’s true he’s crazy, and it’s a shame it’s true, and it’s truly a shame he’s crazy—but now I sound foolish, so I’ll get right to the point. 
Now, if we agree Hamlet’s crazy, then the next step is to figure out the cause of this effect of craziness, or I suppose I should say the cause of this defect, since this defective effect is caused by something. This is what we must do, and that’s exactly what needs to be done. Think about it. I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty. Listen and think about this: (he reads a letter) “To the heavenly idol of my soul, the most beautified Ophelia”—By the way, “beautified” sounds bad, it sounds awful, it sounds crude, it’s a terrible use of the word. But I’ll go on: (he reads the letter) “In her excellent white bosom,” et cetera, et cetera—you don’t need to hear all this stuff— 
###GERTRUDE
Hamlet wrote this letter to Ophelia? 
###POLONIUS
Madam, please be patient. I’ll read it to you. (he reads the letter)  “You may wonder if the stars are fire,  You may wonder if the sun moves across the sky.  You may wonder if the truth is a liar,  But never wonder if I love. Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry. I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all. Believe it.  Yours forever, my dearest one,  as long as I live—still chugging along,     Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it. She’s told me all about how Hamlet has been courting her—all the details of where, and what he said, and when. 
###CLAUDIUS
And how did she react to all this? 
###POLONIUS
Sir, what is your opinion of me? 
###CLAUDIUS
I know you are loyal and honorable. 
###POLONIUS
I would like to prove to you that I am. But what would you have thought of me if I had kept quiet when I found out about this hot little love (which I noticed even before my daughter told me about it)? My dear queen, what would you have thought of me if I had turned a blind eye to what was happening between Hamlet and my daughter? No, I had to do something. And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league. You have to end this.” And then I gave her orders to stay away from him, and not to accept any messages or little gifts from him. She did what I said. When she rejected Hamlet, he became sad, and stopped eating, stopped sleeping, got weak, got dizzy, and as a result lost his mind. And that’s why he’s crazy now, and all of us feel sorry for him. 
###CLAUDIUS
(to GERTRUDE) Do you think that’s why Hamlet’s crazy? 
###GERTRUDE
It may be, it certainly may be. 
###POLONIUS
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true? 
###CLAUDIUS
Not that I know of. 
###POLONIUS
(pointing to his head and shoulders) Chop my head off if I’m wrong. I’ll follow the clues and uncover the truth, even if it’s at the very center of the earth. 
###CLAUDIUS
What can we do to find out if it’s true? 
###POLONIUS
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time. 
###GERTRUDE
Yes, he does. 
###POLONIUS
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him. (to CLAUDIUS) You and I will hide behind the arras and watch what happens. If it turns out that Hamlet’s not in love after all, and hasn’t gone mad from love, then you can fire me from my court job and I’ll go work on a farm. 
###CLAUDIUS
We’ll try what you suggest. 
## HAMLET enters, reading a book.
###GERTRUDE
Look how sadly he’s coming in, reading his book. 
###POLONIUS
Please go away, both of you. I’ll speak to him now. Oh, please let me. 
## CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE exit.
How are you, Hamlet? 
###HAMLET
Fine, thank you. 
###POLONIUS
Do you know who I am? 
###HAMLET
Of course. You sell fish. 
###POLONIUS
No, not me, sir. 
###HAMLET
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller. 
###POLONIUS
Good, sir? 
###HAMLET
Yes, sir. Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world. 
###POLONIUS
That’s definitely true, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter? 
###POLONIUS
I do indeed, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Then by all means never let her walk in public. Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend. 
###POLONIUS
(to himself) Now, what does he mean by that? Still harping on my daughter. But he didn’t recognize me at first. He mistook me for a fish seller. He’s far gone. But when I was young I went crazy for love too, almost as bad as this. I’ll talk to him again.—(to HAMLET) What are you reading, your highness? 
###HAMLET
A lot of words. 
###POLONIUS
And what is the subject? 
###HAMLET
Between whom? 
###POLONIUS
I mean, what do the words say? 
###HAMLET
Oh, just lies, sir. The sly writer says here that old men have gray beards, their faces are wrinkled, their eyes full of gunk, and that they have no wisdom and weak thighs. Of course I believe it all, but I don’t think it’s good manners to write it down, since you yourself, sir, would grow as old as I am, if you could only travel backward like a crab. 
###POLONIUS
(to himself) There’s a method to his madness. (to HAMLET) Will you step outside, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Into my grave. 
###POLONIUS
Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right. (to himself) His answers are so full of meaning sometimes! He has a way with words, as crazy people often do, and that sane people don’t have a talent for. I’ll leave him now and arrange a meeting between him and my daughter. (to HAMLET) My lord, I’ll take my leave of you now. 
###HAMLET
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life. 
###POLONIUS
Good-bye, my lord. 
###HAMLET
(to himself) These boring old fools! 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN enter.
###POLONIUS
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet. He’s right over there. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Thank you, sir. 
## POLONIUS exits.
###GUILDENSTERN
My lord! 
###ROSENCRANTZ
My dear sir! 
###HAMLET
Ah, my good old friends! How are you, Guildenstern? And Rosencrantz! Boys, how are you both doing? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Oh, as well as anybody. 
###GUILDENSTERN
Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky. We’re not exactly at the top of our luck. 
###HAMLET
But you’re not down and out, either, are you? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
No, we’re just somewhere in the middle, my lord. 
###HAMLET
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist? 
###GUILDENSTERN
Yes, we’re the privates in her army. 
###HAMLET
Ha, ha, so you’ve gotten into her private parts? Of course—Lady Luck is such a slut. Anyway, what’s up? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Not much, my lord. Just that the world’s become honest. 
###HAMLET
In that case, the end of the world is approaching. But you’re wrong. Let me ask you a particular question. What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison? 
###GUILDENSTERN
Prison, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Denmark’s a prison. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Then I guess the whole world is one. 
###HAMLET
Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
We don’t think so, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it. And to me, Denmark is a prison. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
That must be because you’re so ambitious. It’s too small for your large mind. 
###HAMLET
Small? No, I could live in a walnut shell and feel like the king of the universe. The real problem is that I have bad dreams. 
###GUILDENSTERN
Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream. 
###HAMLET
But a dream itself is just a shadow. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Exactly. In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow. 
###HAMLET
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars. Should we go inside? I seem to be losing my mind a bit. 
###ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN
We’re at your service, whatever you say. 
###HAMLET
No, no, I won’t class you with my servants, since—to be frank with you—my servants are terrible. But tell me as my friends, what are you doing here at Elsinore? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Visiting you, my lord. There’s no other reason. 
###HAMLET
Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much. Did someone tell you to visit me? Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative? Come on, tell me the truth. 
###GUILDENSTERN
What should we say, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Anything you like, as long as it answers my question. You were sent for. You’ve got a guilty look on your faces, which you’re too honest to disguise. I know the king and queen sent for you. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Why would they do that, my lord? 
###HAMLET
That’s what I want you to tell me. Let me remind you of our old friendship, our youth spent together, the duties of our love for each other, and whatever else will make you answer me straight. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
(to GUILDENSTERN) What do you think? 
###HAMLET
(to himself) I’ve got my eye on you. (to GUILDENSTERN) If you care about me, you’ll be honest with me. 
###GUILDENSTERN
My lord, we were sent for. 
###HAMLET
I’ll tell you why—so you won’t have to tell me and give away any secrets you have with the king and queen. Recently, though I don’t know why, I’ve lost all sense of fun, stopped exercising—the whole world feels sterile and empty. This beautiful canopy we call the sky—this majestic roof decorated with golden sunlight—why, it’s nothing more to me than disease-filled air. What a perfect invention a human is, how noble in his capacity to reason, how unlimited in thinking, how admirable in his shape and movement, how angelic in action, how godlike in understanding! There’s nothing more beautiful. We surpass all other animals. And yet to me, what are we but dust? Men don’t interest me. No—women neither, but you’re smiling, so you must think they do. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, I wasn’t thinking anything like that. 
###HAMLET
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
I was just thinking that if people don’t interest you, you’ll be pretty bored by the actors on their way here. We crossed paths with a drama company just a while ago, and they’re coming to entertain you. 
###HAMLET
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome. I’ll treat him like a real king. The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play. Which troupe is it? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much. 
###HAMLET
What are they doing on the road? They made more money and got more attention in the city. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now. 
###HAMLET
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city? Do they attract big audiences? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
No, not like before. 
###HAMLET
Why? Are they getting rusty? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever. The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it. These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys. 
###HAMLET
What, you mean kid actors? Who takes care of them? Who pays their way? Will they stop working when their voices mature? Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become? (Unless, of course, they have trust funds.) 
###ROSENCRANTZ
There’s been a whole debate on the topic. For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles. 
###HAMLET
Are you kidding? 
###GUILDENSTERN
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling. 
###HAMLET
And the boys are winning so far? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Yes, they are, my lord—little boys are carrying the whole theater on their backs, like Hercules carried the world. 
###HAMLET
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it. My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him. There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it. 
##Trumpets play offstage, announcing the arrival of the PLAYERSplayers = actors PLAYERS .
###GUILDENSTERN
The actors are here. 
###HAMLET
Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore. Don’t be shy—shake hands with me. If I’m going to welcome you I have to go through all these polite customs, don’t I? And if we don’t shake hands, when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you. You are very welcome here. But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea. 
###GUILDENSTERN
In what sense, my lord? 
###HAMLET
I’m only crazy sometimes. At other times, I know what’s what. 
## POLONIUS enters.
###POLONIUS
Gentlemen, I hope you are well. 
###HAMLET
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can! (he gestures toward POLONIUS )This big baby is still in diapers. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again. 
###HAMLET
(whispering to ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN) I bet he’s coming to tell me about the actors; just watch. (to POLONIUS) You’re right, sir, that happened on Monday morning. 
###POLONIUS
My lord, I have news for you. 
###HAMLET
My lord, I have news for you. When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — 
###POLONIUS
The actors have arrived, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Yawn, snore. 
###POLONIUS
I swear— 
###HAMLET
—each actor arrived on his ass. 
###POLONIUS
They are the best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical, one-act plays, or long poems. The tragic playwright Seneca is not too heavy for them to handle nor is the comic writer Plautus too light. For formal plays or freer dramas, these are the best actors around. 
###HAMLET
Oh, Jephthah, judge of ancient Israel, what a treasure you had! 
###POLONIUS
What treasure did he have, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Well, (sings)  One fine daughter, and no more,  Whom he loved more than anything—. 
###POLONIUS
(to himself) Still talking about my daughter, I see. 
###HAMLET
Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man? 
###POLONIUS
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes. 
###HAMLET
No, that’s not logical. 
###POLONIUS
What is logical, then, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Why, 
 As if by chance, God knows, and then, you know,  It happened, as you’d expect— If you want to know more, you can refer to the popular song, because now I have to stop. 
##The PLAYERS enter.
Welcome, welcome to all of you. (he turns to one of the actors)—Oh, you, I’m glad to see you. (turns back to all of them)—Welcome, my good friends. (turns to another actor)—Oh, it’s you! You’ve grown a beard since I saw you last. Are you going to put a beard on me too? (turns to an actor dressed as a woman) —Well hello, my young lady friend. You’ve grown as much as the height of a pair of platform shoes at least! I hope your voice hasn’t changed yet. (to the whole company)—All of you are most welcome here. We’ll get right to business. First, a speech. Come on, give us a little speech to whet our appetites. A passionate speech, please. 
###FIRST PLAYER
Which speech, my lord? 
###HAMLET
I heard you recite a speech for me once that was never acted out, or if it was, it was performed only once, since the play was not popular—like caviar for a slob who couldn’t appreciate it. But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. 
I remember one critic said there was no vulgar language to spice up the dialogue, and showing off on playwright’s part. That critic called it an excellent play, containing things to reflect upon as well as sweet music to enjoy. I loved one speech in particular. It was when Aeneas told Dido about Priam’s murder. If you happen to remember this scene, begin at line—let me see, how does it go?  The rugged Pyrrhus, strong as a tiger— No, that’s wrong; it begins like this:  Savage Pyrrhus, whose black armor was  As dark plans, and was like the night  When he crouched inside the Trojan Horse,  Has now smeared his dark armor  With something worse. From head to foot  He’s now covered in red, decorated horribly  With the blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons.  The blood is baked to a paste by fires he set in the streets,  Fires that lend a terrible light to his horrible murders.  Boiling with anger and fire,  And coated thick with hard-baked blood,  His eyes glowing like rubies, the hellish Pyrrhus  Goes looking for grandfather Priam. Sir, take it from there. 
###POLONIUS
My God, that was well done, my lord, with the right accent and a good ear. 
###FIRST PLAYER
      Soon he finds Priam Failing in his battle against the Greeks. His old sword, Which Priam cannot wield anymore, lies where it fell. An unfair opponent, Pyrrhus rushes at Priam, and in his rage he misses; 
But the wind created by his sword is enough to make The weakened old man fall. Just then the city of Ilium, As if feeling this fatal blow to its ruler, Collapses in flames, and the crash Captures Pyrrhus’s attention. His sword, Which was falling onto Priam’s white-haired head Seemed to hang in the air. Pyrrhus stood there like a man in a painting, Doing nothing. But just as a raging thunderstorm Is often interrupted by a moment’s silence, And then soon after the region is split apart by dreadful thunderclaps, In the same way, after Pyrrhus paused, His newly awakened fury set him to work again. When the Cyclopses were making unbreakable armor For the god of war, their hammers never fell So mercilessly as Pyrrhus’s bloody sword Now falls on Priam. Get out of here, Lady Luck, you whore! All you gods Should come together to rob her of her powers, Break all the spokes on her wheel of fortune, And send it rolling down the hills of heaven Into the depths of hell. 
###POLONIUS
This speech is going on too long. 
###HAMLET
We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard. Please, continue, players. This old man only likes the dancing or the sex scenes; he sleeps through all the rest. Go on, come to the part about Hecuba. 
###FIRST PLAYER
But who—ah, the sadness—had seen the muffled queen— 
###HAMLET
“The muffled queen”? 
###POLONIUS
That’s good. “The muffled queen” is good. 
###FIRST PLAYER
Running back and forth, spraying the flames with her tears, a cloth on that head where a crown had recently sat and a blanket instead of a robe wrapped around her body, which has withered from childbearing: anyone seeing her in such a state, no matter how spiteful he was, would have cursed Lady Luck for bringing her down like that. If the gods had seen her while she watched Pyrrhus chopping her husband into bits, the terrible cry she uttered would have made all the eyes in heaven burn with hot tears—unless the gods don’t care at all about human affairs. 
###POLONIUS
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes. All right, that’s enough, please. 
###HAMLET
(to FIRST PLAYER) Very fine. I’ll have you perform the rest of it soon. (to POLONIUS)—My lord, will you make sure the actors are made comfortable? Make sure you’re good to them, since what they say about us later will go down in history. It’d be better to have a bad epitaph on our graves than to have their ill will while we’re alive. 
###POLONIUS
My lord, I will give them all they deserve. 
###HAMLET
Good heavens, man, give them more than that! If you pay everyone what they deserve, would anyone ever escape a whipping? Treat them with honor and dignity. The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth. Lead them inside. 
###POLONIUS
Come, everyone. 
###HAMLET
Follow him, friends. We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow. (to FIRST PLAYER) My friend, can you perform The Murder of Gonzago? 
###FIRST PLAYER
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night. By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right? 
###FIRST PLAYER
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Very well. Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him. 
## POLONIUS and the PLAYERS exit.
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow. Welcome to Elsinore. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Ah yes, good-bye to you both. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit.
Now I’m alone. Oh, what a mean low-life I am! It’s awful that this actor could force his soul to feel made-up feelings in a work of make-believe. He grew pale, shed real tears, became overwhelmed, his voice breaking with feeling and his whole being, even, meeting the needs of his act—and all for nothing. For Hecuba! 
What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for her? Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling that I do. He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears. But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do? Mope around like a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king whose dear life was stolen. Am I a coward? Is there anyone out there who’ll call me “villain” and slap me hard? Pull off my beard? Pinch my nose? Call me the worst liar? By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it, because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low-life king a long time ago. Bloody, inhuman villain! Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain! Ah, revenge! What an ass I am. I’m so damn brave. My dear father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets. Damn it! I need to get myself together here! Hmm…. I’ve heard that guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out loud. 
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak. I’ll have these actors perform something like my father’s murder in front of my uncle. I’ll watch my uncle. I’ll probe his conscience and see if he flinches. If he becomes pale, I know what to do. The ghost I saw may be the devil, and the devil has the power to assume a pleasing disguise, and so he may be taking advantage of my weakness and sadness to bring about my damnation. I need better evidence than the ghost to work with. The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.

And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
He admits he feels confused, but refuses to say why. 
###GUILDENSTERN
And he’s not exactly eager to be interrogated. He’s very sly and dances around our questions when we try to get him to talk about how he feels. 
###GERTRUDE
Did he treat you well when you saw him? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way. 
###GUILDENSTERN
But it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to us. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length. 
###GERTRUDE
Did you try tempting him with some entertainment? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here. We told Hamlet about them, and that seemed to do him good. 
They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight. 
###POLONIUS
It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend. 
###CLAUDIUS
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested. Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
We will, my lord. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit.
###CLAUDIUS
Dear Gertrude, please give us a moment alone. We’ve secretly arranged for Hamlet to come here so that he can run into Ophelia. Her father and I, justifiably acting as spies, will hide in the room and observe Hamlet’s behavior, to determine whether it’s love that’s making him suffer. 
###GERTRUDE
Yes, I’ll go. As for you, Ophelia, I hope that your beauty is the reason for Hamlet’s insane behavior, just as I hope your virtues will return him to normal some day, for the good of both of you. 
###OPHELIA
I hope so too, Madam. 
## GERTRUDE exits.
###POLONIUS
Ophelia, come here.—(to CLAUDIUS) Your Majesty, we will hide. (to OPHELIA)—Read from this prayer book, so it looks natural that you’re all alone. Come to think of it, this happens all the time—people act devoted to God to mask their bad deeds. 
###CLAUDIUS
(to himself) How right he is! His words whip up my guilty feelings. The whore’s pockmarked cheek made pretty with make-up is just like the ugly actions I’m disguising with fine words. What a terrible guilt I feel! 
###POLONIUS
I hear him coming. Quick, let’s hide, my lord. 
## CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS hide.
## HAMLET enters.
###HAMLET
The question is: is it better to be alive or dead? Is it nobler to put up with all the nasty things that luck throws your way, or to fight against all those troubles by simply putting an end to them once and for all? Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for. To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream. Ah, but there’s the catch: in death’s sleep who knows what kind of dreams might come, after we’ve put the noise and commotion of life behind us. That’s certainly something to worry about. That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long. 
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits? Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t? Fear of death makes us all cowards, and our natural boldness becomes weak with too much thinking. Actions that should be carried out at once get misdirected, and stop being actions at all. But shh, here comes the beautiful Ophelia. Pretty lady, please remember me when you pray. 
###OPHELIA
Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately? 
###HAMLET
Very well, thank you. Well, well, well. 
###OPHELIA
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now. Please take them. 
###HAMLET
No, it wasn’t me. I never gave you anything. 
###OPHELIA
My lord, you know very well that you did, and wrote letters to go along with them, letters so sweetly written that they made your gifts even more valuable. Their perfume is gone now, so take them back. Nice gifts lose 
their value when the givers turn out not to be so nice. There, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Ha ha, are you good? 
###OPHELIA
Excuse me? 
###HAMLET
Are you beautiful? 
###OPHELIA
My lord, what are you talking about? 
###HAMLET
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty. 
###OPHELIA
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness? 
###HAMLET
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin. This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it. I used to love you. 
###OPHELIA
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord. 
###HAMLET
You shouldn’t have believed me, since we’re all rotten at the core, no matter how hard we try to be virtuous. I didn’t love you. 
###OPHELIA
Then I guess I was misled. 
###HAMLET
Get yourself to a convent at once. Why would you want to give birth to more sinners? I’m fairly good myself, but even so I could accuse myself of such horrible crimes that it would’ve been better if my mother had never given birth to me. and 
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in. Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven? Every one of us is a criminal. Don’t believe any of us. Hurry to a convent. Where’s your father? 
###OPHELIA
He’s at home, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only. Good-bye. 
###OPHELIA
Oh, dear God, please help him! 
###HAMLET
If you marry, I’ll give you this curse as your wedding present—be as clean as ice, as pure as the driven snow, and you’ll still get a bad reputation. Get yourself to a convent, at once. Good-bye. Or if you have to get married, marry a fool, since wise men know far too well that you’ll cheat on them. Good-bye. 
###OPHELIA
Dear God, please make him normal again! 
###HAMLET
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too. God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it. You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance. Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore. It’s driven me crazy. I hereby declare we will have no more marriage. Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person. Everyone else will have to stay single. Get yourself to a convent, fast. 
## HAMLET exits.
###OPHELIA
Oh, how noble his mind used to be, and how lost he is now! He used to have a gentleman’s grace, a scholar’s wit, and a soldier’s strength. He used to be the jewel of our country, the obvious heir to the throne, the one everyone admired and imitated. And now he has fallen so low! And of all the miserable women who once enjoyed hearing his sweet, seductive words, I am the most miserable. A mind that used to sing so sweetly is now completely out of tune, making harsh sounds instead of fine notes. The unparalleled appearance and nobility he had in the full bloom of his youth has been ruined by madness. O, how miserable I am to see Hamlet now and know what he was before! 
## CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS come forward.
###CLAUDIUS
Love? His feelings don’t move in that direction. And his words, although they were a little disorganized, weren’t crazy. No, his sadness is hatching something, like a hen does sitting on an egg. What hatches very well may be dangerous. So to prevent any harm being done, I’ve made a quick executive decision: he’ll be sent to England to try to get back the money they owe us. With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind. What do you think of this plan? 
###POLONIUS
It should work. But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia. You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said. 
We heard everything.—My lord, do whatever you like, but if you like this idea, let his mother the queen get him alone and beg him to share his feelings with her. I’ll hide and listen in. If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best. 
###CLAUDIUS
That’s how we’ll do it, then. When important people start to show signs of insanity, you have to watch them closely. 
##They all exit.
## HAMLET and the PLAYERS enter.
###HAMLET
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly. If you exaggerate the words the way some actors do, I might as well have some newscaster read the lines. Don’t use too many hand gestures; just do a few, gently, like this. When you get into a whirlwind of passion on stage, remember to keep the emotion moderate and smooth. I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows. I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical. That’s as bad as those old plays in which King Herod ranted. Please avoid doing that. 
###FIRST PLAYER
I will, sir. 
###HAMLET
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you. Fit the action to the word and the word to the action. Act natural at all costs. Exaggeration has no place in the theater, where the purpose is to represent reality, holding a mirror up to virtue, to vice, and to the spirit of the times. If you handle this badly, it just makes ignorant people laugh while regular theater-goers are miserable—and they’re the ones you should be keeping happy. 
I’ve seen actors who are highly praised, but who—not to be too rude here—can’t even talk or walk like human beings. They bellow and strut about like weird animals that were made to look like men, but very badly. 
###FIRST PLAYER
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir. 
###HAMLET
Oh, correct it completely. Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed. It’s bad behavior for an actor, anyway, and displays a pitiful ambition to hog the limelight on stage. 
##The PLAYERS exit.
## POLONIUS, GUILDENSTERN, and ROSENCRANTZ enter.
So, my lord, will the king be attending the performance? 
###POLONIUS
Yes, he will, and the queen as well. 
###HAMLET
Tell the actors to hurry. 
## POLONIUS exits.
Will you two help them get ready? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Yes, my lord. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit.
###HAMLET
Well, hello there, Horatio! 
## HORATIO enters.
###HORATIO
Here I am at your service, my dear lord. 
###HAMLET
Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known. 
###HORATIO
Oh, sir— 
###HAMLET
Don’t think I’m flattering you. What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life? Why would anyone flatter a poor person? No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well. You understand? Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad. Blessed are those who mix emotion with reason in just the right proportion, making them strong enough to resist the whims of Lady Luck. Show me the person who’s master of his emotions, and I’ll put him close to my heart—in my heart of hearts—as I do you. But I’m talking too much. The point is, there’s a play being performed for the king tonight. One of the scenes comes very close to depicting the circumstances of my father’s death, as I described them to you. Watch my uncle carefully when that scene begins. If his guilty secret does not reveal itself, then that ghost was just a devil, and my hunch wasn’t, in fact, worth anything. 
Watch him closely. I’ll stare at him too, and afterward we’ll compare notes on him. 
###HORATIO
My lord, I’ll watch him as closely as I would a thief. I won’t miss a trick. 
##Trumpets play. CLAUDIUS enters with GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and other lords attendant with CLAUDIUS ’s guard carrying torches.
###HAMLET
They’re coming. I can’t talk now. Take your seat. 
###CLAUDIUS
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing? 
###HAMLET
Wonderful! I eat the air, like chameleons do. I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it. 
###CLAUDIUS
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet. You’re not answering my question. 
###HAMLET
Mine, neither. (to POLONIUS) My lord, you performed in amateur dramatic productions in college, right? 
###POLONIUS
Indeed I did, my lord. I was considered to be quite a good actor. 
###HAMLET
What role did you play? 
###POLONIUS
I played Julius Caesar. I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me. 
###HAMLET
That was brutish of them, to kill so capital a guy. —Are the actors ready? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Yes, my lord. They’re ready whenever you are. 
###GERTRUDE
Come here, my dear Hamlet. Sit by me. 
###HAMLET
No thanks, my good mother. There’s a nicer piece of work right here. (he sits down near OPHELIA ) 
###POLONIUS
(to CLAUDIUS) Hey, did you notice that? 
###HAMLET
My lady, should I lie in your lap? 
###OPHELIA
No, my lord. 
###HAMLET
I mean, with my head in your lap? 
###OPHELIA
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Did you think I was talking about sex? 
###OPHELIA
I think nothing, my lord. 
###HAMLET
That’s a nice thought to lie between a girl’s legs. 
###OPHELIA
What is, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Nothing. 
###OPHELIA
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Who, me? 
###OPHELIA
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all. What can you do but be happy? Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died. 
###OPHELIA
No, my lord, it’s been four months. 
###HAMLET
As long as that? Well, in that case these mourning clothes can go to hell. I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit. Good heavens, he died two months ago and hasn’t been forgotten yet? In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months. But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.” 
Trumpets play. The pantomime show begins. A king and queen enter and embrace lovingly. She kneels before him and resists his passion. He lifts her up and lays his head on her neck. He lies down on a bank of flowers. When she sees him sleeping, she leaves. Another man comes in, takes the crown from the king, pours poison in the sleeping man’s ear, and leaves. The queen returns and finds the king dead. She becomes hysterical. The killer comes back with three others and calms the queen. The body is carried away. The killer woos the queen with gifts. She is cold toward him for a while but then relents and accepts his advances. 
##The PLAYERS exit.
###OPHELIA
What does this mean, my lord? 
###HAMLET
This means we’re having some mischievous fun. 
###OPHELIA
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play. 
##The PROLOGUE—the actor who will introduce the play—enters.
###HAMLET
This guy will tell us everything. Actors can’t keep a secret. They’ll tell all. 
###OPHELIA
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant? 
###HAMLET
Sure, or anything else you show him. As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means. 
###OPHELIA
You’re naughty. I’m watching the play. 
###PROLOGUE
We beg you most courteously To be patient with us And watch our humble tragedy. 
##The PROLOGUE exits.
###HAMLET
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring? 
###OPHELIA
It was a bit short, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Yes, as short as a woman’s love. 
##Actors playing the roles of KING and QUEEN enter.
###PLAYER KING
It’s been thirty years since we were married. 
###PLAYER QUEEN
I hope we stay in love for thirty more years! But I’m sad. You’ve been so gloomy lately, so unlike your usual cheerful self, that I worry something is wrong. But don’t let this upset you, since women are too afraid in love—for them, love and fear go hand in hand. You know very well how much I love you, and my fear is just as deep. When someone’s love is great, the little worries become very big. So when you see someone who worries a lot about little things, you know they’re really in love. 
###PLAYER KING
My love, I will have to leave you soon. My body is growing weak, and I will leave you behind in this beautiful world, honored and much loved. Perhaps you’ll find another husband— 
###PLAYER QUEEN
Oh, damn everyone else! Remarrying would be treason to my heart. Curse me if I take a second husband. When a woman takes a second husband, it’s because she’s killed off the first. 
###HAMLET
(to himself) Harsh! 
###PLAYER QUEEN
Someone might marry a second time for money, but never for love. Any time I kissed my second husband in bed, I’d kill the first one all over again. 
###PLAYER KING
I know that’s what you think now, but people change their minds. Often our intentions are strong at first, but as time goes on they weaken, just like an apple sticks to the tree when it is unripe but falls to the ground once it ripens. The promises we make to ourselves in emotional moments lose their power once the emotion passes. Great grief and joy may rouse us to action, but when the grief or joy have passed, we’re no longer motivated to act. Joy turns to grief in the blink of an eye, and grief becomes joy just as quickly. This world is not made for either one to last long in, and it’s no surprise that even our loves change along with our luck. It’s still a mystery to be solved whether luck controls love, or love controls luck. When a great man has a run of bad luck, watch how followers desert him, and when a poor man advances to an important position, he makes friends with the people he used to hate. Love is unreliable. A person with lots of money will always have friends, while one fallen on hard times makes an enemy of any friend he turns to for money. But back to my original point—what we want and what we get are always at odds. We can have our little dreams, but the fates decide our futures. You think now you’ll never remarry, but that thought will die with me, your first husband. 
###PLAYER QUEEN
May the earth refuse me food and the heavens go dark, may I have no rest day and night, may my trust and hope turn to despair—may the gloom of a prison overtake me, and may my every joy be turned to sorrow. May I know no peace either in this life or the next one, if I become a wife again after I am a widow. 
###HAMLET
Nice vow, but what if she breaks it? 
###PLAYER KING
You have made this vow with deep sincerity. My dear, leave me alone now awhile. My mind is getting foggy, and I would like to sleep and escape this endless day. 
##The PLAYER KING sleeps.
###PLAYER QUEEN
Sleep tight, and may nothing come between us. 
##The PLAYER QUEEN exits.
###HAMLET
Madam, how are you liking this play? 
###GERTRUDE
The lady’s overdoing it, I think. 
###HAMLET
Oh, but she’ll keep her word. 
###CLAUDIUS
Do you know the plot? Is there anything offensive in it? 
###HAMLET
No, no, it’s just a joke, a little jibe but all in good fun. Not offensive at all. 
###CLAUDIUS
What’s the play called? 
###HAMLET
The Mousetrap. Why on earth is it called that, you ask? It’s a metaphor. This play is about a murder committed in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke’s name, and his wife is Baptista. You’ll see soon enough. It’s a piece of garbage, but who cares? You and I have free souls, so it doesn’t concern us. Let the guilty wince. We can watch without being bothered. 
## LUCIANUS enters.
This is Lucianus, the king’s nephew in the play. 
###OPHELIA
You’re an expert commentator, aren’t you? 
###HAMLET
Yes. I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me. 
###OPHELIA
Ooh, you’re sharp. 
###HAMLET
Yes, pointy, but you could take the edge off me— though it might make you moan a little. 
###OPHELIA
You get better in your jokes and worse in your manners. 
###HAMLET
That’s what you women get when you trick us into marriage.—Let’s get started, murderer on stage, please! Damn it, stop fussing with the makeup, and get going. We’re all waiting for the revenge! 
###LUCIANUS
Evil thoughts, ready hands, the right poison, and the time is right too. The dark night is on my side, for no one can see me. You deadly mixture of weeds and plants, which Hecate, goddess of witchcraft, has put a spell on, use your magic to steal this healthy person’s life away. (pours the poison into the PLAYER KING ’s ears) 
###HAMLET
You see, he poisons the king in his own garden to get the kingdom for himself. The king’s name is Gonzago. The original story was written in the finest Italian. You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife. 
## CLAUDIUS stands up.
###OPHELIA
The king is getting up. 
###HAMLET
What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank? 
###GERTRUDE
My lord, how are you feeling? 
###POLONIUS
Stop the play. 
###CLAUDIUS
Turn on the lights. Get me out of here! 
###POLONIUS
Lights, lights, get us some lights! 
##Everyone except HAMLET and HORATIO exits.
###HAMLET
 Let the deer that’s been shot go off and weep,  While the unharmed deer happily plays.  For some must watch while other must sleep,  That’s how the world goes. Couldn’t I get work as an actor (if I hit a run of bad luck) in some acting company, and wear flowers on my shoes? 
###HORATIO
They might even give you half a share of the company. 
###HAMLET
No, a whole share for me.  For you know, my dearest Damon,  That Jove, king of the gods, was  Thrown out of power here, and  Who’s in charge? A big—peacock. 
###HORATIO
You could have at least rhymed. 
###HAMLET
Oh, Horatio, I’ll bet you a thousand bucks the ghost was right. Did you notice? 
###HORATIO
Yes, I did, my lord. 
###HAMLET
When the actors were talking about poison? 
###HORATIO
I watched him very closely. 
###HAMLET
Ah ha! Hey, let’s have some music here! Play your flutes!  For if the king doesn’t like the play,  Then he doesn’t like it, we may say. Come on, music! 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN enter.
###GUILDENSTERN
My lord, could I have a word with you? 
###HAMLET
You can have a whole story, not just a word. 
###GUILDENSTERN
Sir, the king— 
###HAMLET
Yes, what about him? 
###GUILDENSTERN
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset. 
###HAMLET
What, an upset stomach from too much booze? 
###GUILDENSTERN
No, sir, he’s angry. 
###HAMLET
You should be smart enough to tell this to a doctor, not me, since if I treated him, he’d just get angrier. 
###GUILDENSTERN
My lord, please try to stick to the subject at hand. 
###HAMLET
I’ll be good, sir. Go ahead. 
###GUILDENSTERN
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you. 
###HAMLET
It’s lovely to see you. 
###GUILDENSTERN
No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point. If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants. If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business. 
###HAMLET
Sir, I can’t. 
###GUILDENSTERN
Can’t what, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Stop fooling around. My mind is confused. But I’ll do my best to give you a straight answer, as you wish—or rather, as my mother wishes. Okay, to the point. My mother, you say …? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
She says that your behavior has astonished her. 
###HAMLET
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother! But what’s the upshot of her admiration? Do tell. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed. 
###HAMLET
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over. Is there anything else I can do for you? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you used to like me. 
###HAMLET
And still do, I swear by my hands. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, what’s wrong with you? You’re not doing yourself any good by refusing to tell your friends what’s bothering you. 
###HAMLET
Sir, I have no future ahead of me. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne? 
##The PLAYERS enter with recordersA recorder is a wind instrument that sounds like a fluterecorders .
###HAMLET
Yes, eventually, but as the proverb goes, “While the grass grows …” But that’s a tired old proverb. Oh, the recorders! Let me see one.(he takes a recorder and turns to GUILDENSTERN ) Why are you hovering so close, as if you want to ambush me? 
###GUILDENSTERN
Oh, my lord, I’m sorry if I’m forgetting my manners. It’s just that I’m worried about you. 
###HAMLET
I don’t really understand what you mean. Will you play this recorder? 
###GUILDENSTERN
I can’t, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Please. 
###GUILDENSTERN
I’m serious, I can’t. 
###HAMLET
I’m begging you. 
###GUILDENSTERN
I have no idea how. 
###HAMLET
Oh, it’s as easy as lying. Just put your fingers and thumb over the holes and blow into it, and it’ll produce the most moving music. Here, the holes are here. 
###GUILDENSTERN
But I can’t play a melody. I don’t know how. 
###HAMLET
Well, look how you play me—as if you knew exactly where to put your fingers, to blow the mystery out of me, playing all the octaves of my range—and yet you can’t even produce music from this little instrument? My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe? You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool. 
## POLONIUS enters.
Hello and God bless you, sir. 
###POLONIUS
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away. 
###HAMLET
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel? 
###POLONIUS
By God, it does look like a camel. 
###HAMLET
To me it looks like a weasel. 
###POLONIUS
It does have a back like a weasel’s. 
###HAMLET
Or like a whale. 
###POLONIUS
Yes, very much like a whale. 
###HAMLET
I’ll go see my mother soon. (to himself) They’re trying as hard as they can to mess with me.—I will go soon. 
###POLONIUS
I’ll tell her. 
###HAMLET
It’s easy enough to say “soon.” 
## POLONIUS exits.
Now please leave me alone, my friends. 
##Everyone except HAMLET exits.
This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out. I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight. But I’ve got to go see my mother.—Oh, heart, don’t grow weak, like Nero Let me be cruel, but not inhuman. 
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her. And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds. 
## HAMLET exits.
## CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN enter.
###CLAUDIUS
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control. So get prepared. I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you. As king, I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour. 
###GUILDENSTERN
We’ll take care of it. It’s a sacred duty to protect the lives of all those who depend on Your Highness. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Everyone tries to avoid harm, but the public figure demands even more protection. When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him. He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it. Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans. 
###CLAUDIUS
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip. We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild. 
###ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN
We’ll hurry. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit.
## POLONIUS enters.
###POLONIUS
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room. I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say. I bet she’ll chew him out. And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him. Goodbye, my lord. I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard. 
###CLAUDIUS
Thanks, my dear lord. 
## POLONIUS exits.
Oh, my crime is so rotten it stinks all the way to heaven. It has the mark of Cain on it, a brother’s murder. I can’t pray, though I want to desperately. My guilt is stronger even than my intentions. And like a person with two opposite things to do at once, I stand paralyzed and neglect them both. So what if this cursed hand of mine is coated with my brother’s blood? Isn’t there enough rain in heaven to wash it clean as snow? Isn’t that what God’s mercy is for? And doesn’t prayer serve these two purposes—to keep us from sinning and to bring us forgiveness when we have sinned? So I’ll pray. I’ve already committed my sin. But, oh, what kind of prayer is there for me? “Dear Lord, forgive me for my horrible murder”? 
That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen. Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime? In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside. But not in heaven. Up there, every action is judged for exactly what it’s worth, and we’re forced to confront our crimes. So what can I do? What is there left to do? Offer whatever repentance I can—that couldn’t hurt. But it can’t help either! Oh, what a lousy situation I’m in. My heart’s as black as death. My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks. Help me, angels! C’mon, make an effort. Bend, stubborn knees. Steely heart, be soft as a newborn babe, so I can pray. Perhaps everything will turn out okay after all. (he kneels) 
## HAMLET enters.
###HAMLET
I could do it easily now. He’s praying now. And now I’ll do it. (he draws out his sword) And there he goes, off to heaven. And that’s my revenge. I’d better think about this more carefully. A villain kills my father, and I, my father’s only son, send this same villain to heaven. Seems like I just did him a favor. He killed my father when my father was enjoying life, with all his sins in full bloom, before my father could repent for any of them. Only God knows how many sins my father has to pay for. As for me, I don’t think his prospects look so good. 
So is it really revenge for me if I kill Claudius right when he is confessing his sins, in perfect condition for a trip to heaven? No. Away, sword, and wait for a better moment to kill him. (he puts his sword away) When he’s sleeping off some drunken orgy, or having incestuous sex, or swearing while he gambles, or committing some other act that has no goodness about it—that’s when I’ll trip him up and send him to hell with his heels kicking up at heaven. My mother’s waiting. The king’s trying to cure himself with prayer, but all he’s doing is keeping himself alive a little longer. 
## HAMLET exits.
###CLAUDIUS
(rising) My words fly up toward heaven, but my thoughts stay down here on earth. Words without thoughts behind them will never make it to heaven. 
## CLAUDIUS exits.
## GERTRUDEand POLONIUS enter.
###POLONIUS
He’ll come right away. Make sure you lay into him. Tell him his pranks have caused too much trouble, and that Your Highness has taken a lot of heat for them. I’ll be right here, silent. Please be blunt with him. 
###HAMLET
(offstage) Mother, mother, mother! 
###GERTRUDE
Don’t worry, I’ll do what you say. Now hide, I hear him coming. 
## POLONIUS hides behind the tapestry.
## HAMLET enters.
###HAMLET
Now mother, what’s this all about? 
###GERTRUDE
Hamlet, you’ve insulted your father. 
###HAMLET
Mother, you’ve insulted my father. 
###GERTRUDE
Come on, you’re answering me foolishly. 
###HAMLET
Go on, you’re questioning me evilly. 
###GERTRUDE
Hamlet, what, why? 
###HAMLET
What’s the problem now? 
###GERTRUDE
Have you forgotten who I am? 
###HAMLET
For God’s sake no, I haven’t. You are the queen, your husband’s brother’s wife, and you are my mother, though I wish you weren’t. 
###GERTRUDE
In that case I’ll call in others who can still speak. 
###HAMLET
No, sit down. You won’t budge until I hold a mirror up to you, where you will see what’s deep inside you. 
###GERTRUDE
What are you going to do? You won’t kill me, will you? Help! 
###POLONIUS
(from behind the tapestry) Hey! Help, help, help! 
###HAMLET
What’s this, a rat? I’ll bet a buck he’s a dead rat now. 
##(he stabs his sword through the tapestry and kills POLONIUS)
###POLONIUS
(from behind the tapestry) Oh, I’ve been killed! 
###GERTRUDE
Oh my God, what have you done? 
###HAMLET
I don’t know. Is it the king? 
###GERTRUDE
Oh, what a senseless, horrible act! 
###HAMLET
A horrible act—almost as bad, my good mother, as killing a king and marrying his brother. 
###GERTRUDE
Killing a king? 
###HAMLET
That’s what I said, my good woman. 
##(he pulls back the tapestry and discovers POLONIUS)
You low-life, nosy, busybody fool, goodbye. I thought you were somebody more important. You’ve gotten what you deserve. I guess you found out it’s dangerous to be a busybody. (to GERTRUDE) Stop wringing your hands. Sit down and let me wring your heart instead, which I will do if it’s still soft enough, if your evil lifestyle has not toughened it against feeling anything at all. 
###GERTRUDE
What have I done that you dare to talk to me so rudely? 
###HAMLET
A deed that destroys modesty, turns virtue into hypocrisy, replaces the blossom on the face of true love with a nasty blemish, makes marriage vows as false as a gambler’s oath—oh, you’ve done a deed that plucks the soul out of marriage and turns religion into meaningless blather. Heaven looks down on this earth, as angry as if Judgment Day were here, and is sick at the thought of what you’ve done. 
###GERTRUDE
C’mon, what’s this deed that sounds so awful even before I know what it is? 
###HAMLET
Look at this picture here, and that one there, the painted images of two brothers. Look how kind and gentlemanly this one is, with his curly hair and his forehead like a Greek god. His eye could command like the god of war. His body is as agile as Mercury just landing on a high hill. A figure and a combination of good qualities that seemed like every god had set his stamp on this man. 
That was your husband. Now look at this other one. Here is your present husband, like a mildewed ear of corn infecting the healthy one next to it. Do you have eyes? How could you leave the lofty heights of this man here and descend as low as this one? Ha! Do you have eyes? You cannot say you did it out of love, since at your age romantic passions have grown weak, and the heart obeys reason. But what reason could move you from this one to that one? You must have some sense in your head, since you’re able to get around, but it seems to be paralyzed, since even if you were crazy you would know the difference between these two men. No one ever went so insane that they couldn’t get an easy choice like this one right. What devil was it that blindfolded you? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or eyes, smell without anything else, the use of even one impaired sense would not permit such a mistake as yours. Oh, for shame, why aren’t you blushing? If evil can overtake even an old mother’s bones, then let it melt my own. It turns out it’s no longer shameful to act on impulse—now that the old are doing so, and now that reason is a servant to desire. 
###GERTRUDE
Oh, Hamlet, stop! You’re making me look into my very soul, where the marks of sin are so thick and black they will never be washed away. 
###HAMLET
Yes, and you lie in the sweaty stench of your dirty sheets, wet with corruption, making love— 
###GERTRUDE
Oh, you must stop! Your words are like daggers. Please, no more, sweet Hamlet. 
###HAMLET
A murderer and a villain, a low-life who’s not worth a twentieth of a tenth of your first husband—the worst of kings, a thief of the throne, who took the precious crown from a shelf and put it in his pocket— 
###GERTRUDE
Stop! 
###HAMLET
A ragtag king— 
##The GHOST enters.
Oh, angels in heaven, protect me with your wings!—What can I do for you, my gracious lord? 
###GERTRUDE
Oh no! Hamlet’s gone completely crazy. 
###HAMLET
Have you come to scold your tardy son for straying from his mission, letting your important command slip by? Tell me! 
###GHOST
Don’t forget. I’ve come to sharpen your somewhat dull appetite for revenge. But look, your mother is in shock. Oh, keep her struggling soul from being overwhelmed by horrid visions. The imagination works strongest in those with the weakest bodies. Talk to her, Hamlet. 
###HAMLET
How are you doing, madam? 
###GERTRUDE
And how are you doing, staring into the empty air and talking to nobody? Your eyes give away your wild thoughts, and your hair is standing upright, like soldiers during a call to arms. Oh my dear son, calm yourself and cool off your overheated mind! What are you staring at? 
###HAMLET
At him, at him! Look how pale he is and how he glares at me. Preaching even at stones, he could get them to act. (to the GHOST) Don’t look at me like that, unless you want me to cry instead of kill. 
###GERTRUDE
Who are you talking to? 
###HAMLET
You don’t see anything? 
###GERTRUDE
Nothing at all, but I can see everything that’s here. 
###HAMLET
And you don’t hear anything? 
###GERTRUDE
No, nothing but us talking. 
###HAMLET
Look, look how it’s sneaking away! My father, dressed just like he was when he was alive! Look, he’s going out the door right now! 
##The GHOST exits.
###GERTRUDE
This is only a figment of your imagination. Madness is good at creating hallucinations. 
###HAMLET
Madness? My heart beats just as evenly as yours does. There’s nothing crazy in what I’ve just uttered. Put me to the test. I’ll rephrase everything I’ve just said, which a lunatic couldn’t do. Mother, for the love of God, don’t flatter yourself into believing that it’s my madness, not your crime, that’s the problem. You’d just be concealing the rot that’s eating you from the inside. Confess your sins to heaven. Repent and avoid damnation. Don’t spread manure over the weeds in your heart; it’ll only make them more filthy. Forgive me my good intentions here since in these fat and spoiled times, virtuous people have to say, “Beg your pardon” to vile ones and beg for the chance to do any good. 
###GERTRUDE
Oh Hamlet, you’ve broken my heart in two! 
###HAMLET
Then throw away the worse half, and live a purer life with the other! Good night to you. But don’t go to my uncle’s bed tonight. At least pretend to be virtuous, even if you’re not. Habit is a terrible thing, in that it’s easy to get used to doing evil without feeling bad about it. But it’s also a good thing, in that being good can also become a habit. Say no to sex tonight, and that will make it easier to say no the next time, and still easier the time after that. Habit can change even one’s natural instincts, and either rein in the devil in us, or kick him out. Once again, good night to you, and when you want to repent, I’ll ask you for your blessing too. I’m sorry about what happened to this gentleman (pointing to POLONIUS), but 
God wanted to punish me with this murder, and this man with me, so I’m both Heaven’s executioner and its minister of justice. This is bad, but it’ll get worse soon. Oh, and one other thing, madam. 
###GERTRUDE
What should I do? 
###HAMLET
Whatever you do, don’t do this: let the fat king seduce you into his bed again, so he can pinch your cheek, call you his bunny, and with filthy kisses and a massage of your neck with his damned fingers, make you admit that my madness is fake, all calculated. What a great idea that would be, because why would a fair, sober, wise queen hide such things from a toad, a pig, a monster like him? Who would do that? No, no, it’s much, much better to spill the beans right away, let the cat out of the bag, and break your neck in the process. 
###GERTRUDE
You can rest easy, since words are made of breath, and breathing requires that you be alive. I feel too dead to breathe a word of what you’ve told me. 
###HAMLET
I have to go to England, don’t you know that? 
###GERTRUDE
Ah, I’d forgotten all about that! It’s been decided. 
###HAMLET
Yes, it’s a done deal, the documents are ready, and my two schoolmates, whom I trust about as much as rattlesnakes, are in charge. They’re the ones who’ll lead me on my march to mischief. Let it happen. It’s fun to watch the engineer get blown up by his own explosives, and with any luck I’ll dig a few feet below their bombs and blow them to the moon. Oh, it’s nice to kill two birds with one stone. (points to POLONIUS) Now that I’ve killed this guy, I’ll be off in a hurry. I’ll lug his guts into the next room. Mother, have a good night. This politician who was in life a babbling idiot is now quiet and serious. Come on, sir, let’s get to the end of our business. Good night, mother. 
##They exit, HAMLET dragging POLONIUS offstage.
## CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE enter with ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.
###CLAUDIUS
(to GERTRUDE) These deep, heaving sighs of yours mean something. You have to tell me what. I need to know. Where’s your son? 
###GERTRUDE
(to ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN) Let us speak privately awhile, please. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit.
Ah, my lord, you wouldn’t believe what I’ve witnessed tonight! 
###CLAUDIUS
What, Gertrude? How is Hamlet? 
###GERTRUDE
As mad as the waves and the wind when they struggle together in a storm. In an insane rage, he hears something behind the tapestry, whips out his sword, shouts, “A rat, a rat!” and in his deranged state of mind he kills the good old man, who is still hidden. 
###CLAUDIUS
Oh, this is terrible! It would’ve happened to me if I’d been there. His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone. How will we deal with this violent deed? I’m the one who will be blamed for not restraining and confining this mad young man. But I loved him so much I didn’t want to think about what I had to do. So, like someone suffering from a nasty disease who refuses to divulge his condition and lets it infect him to 
the core, I kept Hamlet’s condition secret and let it grow more and more dangerous. Where has he gone? 
###GERTRUDE
To remove the corpse of the man he killed. His madness allows a glimmering of morality to shine through, like a vein of gold in a chunk of coal. He weeps for what he has done. 
###CLAUDIUS
Oh, Gertrude, let’s go. As soon as the sun sets we’ll ship him off to England. It’ll take all my diplomatic know-how to explain and excuse the murder he’s committed. Hey, Guildenstern! 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN enter.
My friends, go find others to help you. Hamlet in his madness has killed Polonius and dragged him out of his mother’s bedroom. Go find him and speak nicely to him, and bring the corpse into the chapel. Please hurry. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN exit.
Come, Gertrude. We’ll confer with our wisest friends and tell them what we’re going to do, and what terrible deed has been done already. Let’s hope slander—a bullet that can travel halfway around the world and still hit its exact target—spares us. Oh, we must go. I’m full of confusion and despair. 
##They exit.
## HAMLET enters.
###HAMLET
The body is safely hidden. 
###GENTLEMEN
(from offstage) Hamlet, Lord Hamlet! 
###HAMLET
What’s that noise? Who’s calling for Hamlet? Oh, here they come. 
## ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN enter with others.
###ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done with the corpse, my lord? 
###HAMLET
I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
But tell us where it is, so we can take it to the chapel. 
###HAMLET
Don’t believe it. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what? 
###HAMLET
That I’d take your advice rather than keep my own secret. Besides, you’re a sponge! What is the son of a king supposed to say to a sponge? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
You think I’m a sponge, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Yes, sir, a sponge that soaks up the king’s approval, his rewards, and his decisions. Officers like that give the king the best service in the end. He keeps them in his mouth like an ape. First he moves them around, then he swallows them. When he needs what you have found out, he can just squeeze you like a sponge and you’ll be dry again. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
I don’t follow, my lord. 
###HAMLET
I’m glad about that. Sly words are never understood by fools. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you have to tell us where the body is, and then go with us to see the king. 
###HAMLET
The body’s with the king, but the king’s not with the body. The king’s a thing … 
###GUILDENSTERN
A “thing,” my lord? 
###HAMLET
A thing of no importance. Take me to him. Ready or not, here I come! 
##They exit.
## CLAUDIUS enters with two or three of his attendants.
###CLAUDIUS
I’ve sent men to find him and retrieve the body. How dangerous to have this madman on the loose! But we can’t throw him in jail. The people love him, because they judge based on appearance rather than reason. They’ll pay attention to the severity of the punishment, not the severity of the crime. No, we must seem calm and fair-minded, and our sending him away must seem like a carefully considered move. But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all. 
## ROSENCRANTZ enters.
So what’s happened? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
We can’t get him to tell us where he’s put the body. 
###CLAUDIUS
But where is he? 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Outside, my lord, under guard, waiting for your orders. 
###CLAUDIUS
Bring him to me. 
###ROSENCRANTZ
Hey, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord. 
## GUILDENSTERN enters with HAMLET.
###CLAUDIUS
Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius? 
###HAMLET
At dinner. 
###CLAUDIUS
At dinner where? 
###HAMLET
Not where he’s eating, but where he’s being eaten. A certain conference of worms is chowing down on him. Worms are the emperor of all diets. We fatten up all creatures to feed ourselves, and we fatten ourselves for the worms to eat when we’re dead. A fat king and a skinny beggar are just two dishes at the same meal. That’s all I have to say. 
###CLAUDIUS
Oh no, oh no! 
###HAMLET
A man can fish with the worm that ate a king, and then eat the fish he catches with that worm. 
###CLAUDIUS
What do you mean by that? 
###HAMLET
Nothing much, just to demonstrate that a king can move through the bowels of a beggar. 
###CLAUDIUS
Where is Polonius? 
###HAMLET
In heaven. Send a messager there if you want to be sure. If your messenger can’t find him, you can check hell yourself. But seriously, if you don’t find him within the next month, you’ll be sure to smell him as you go upstairs into the main hall. 
###CLAUDIUS
(to attendants) Go look for him there. 
##Some attendants exit.
###HAMLET
No need to hurry, he’s not going anywhere. 
###CLAUDIUS
Hamlet, I care for you just as much as I grieve for Polonius. For your own protection, I must send you to England at once. So get ready to leave. The ship is set to sail, the wind is favorable, your servants are waiting for you—everything is ready for you to go to England. 
###HAMLET
To England? 
###CLAUDIUS
Yes, Hamlet. 
###HAMLET
Good. 
###CLAUDIUS
Yes, you’d think so, if you knew why I was sending you. 
###HAMLET
I know an angel who can read your mind. But okay, off to England! Good-bye, dear mother. 
###CLAUDIUS
I’m your father, Hamlet—your father who loves you. 
###HAMLET
You’re my mother. When you married my mother, the two of you became one flesh, so if you’re my father you’re also my mother. Come on, off to England! 
## HAMLET exits.
###CLAUDIUS
Follow him on foot, and get him on board as quickly as possible. Don’t waste any time. I want him out of here tonight. Go now; everything else is ready. Please hurry. 
##Everyone except CLAUDIUS exits.
And you, dear king of England, if you care about me at all—and you should, since you can still feel the damage that Denmark has done to you in the past and, so, fear and respect us—then you won’t ignore my letters instructing you to kill Hamlet immediately. Do it, 
English king, since he’s raging like a fever in my brain, and you must cure me. Until I know it’s been done, I’ll never be happy, no matter how much luck I have. 
##He exits.
## FORTINBRAS enters with his army and a CAPTAIN.
###FORTINBRAS
Go, Captain, and give the Danish king my greetings. Tell him that Fortinbras asks permission to move his troops across Denmark. You know the meeting place we’ve arranged. If His Majesty wants us to do any favor for him, tell him his wish is my command. 
###CAPTAIN
I’ll tell him, my lord. 
###FORTINBRAS
Go ahead, then. 
##Everyone except the CAPTAIN exits.
## HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others enter.
###HAMLET
Sir, whose troops are these? 
###CAPTAIN
The king of Norway’s, sir. 
###HAMLET
What are they doing here, sir? 
###CAPTAIN
They’re on their way to invade some part of Poland. 
###HAMLET
Who’s commanding them, sir? 
###CAPTAIN
The nephew of the old king of Norway, Fortinbras. 
###HAMLET
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier? 
###CAPTAIN
To tell the truth, we’re fighting to win a little patch of ground that’s not worth anything. I myself wouldn’t pay five ducats for it, if someone offered it to me to farm. And it won’t provide any more profits than that to either the Norwegian or the Pole. 
###HAMLET
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it. 
###CAPTAIN
Oh, yes they will. They’ve already stationed troops there. 
###HAMLET
(to himself) Even two thousand men and twenty-thousand ducats are just the beginning of what it will cost to settle this pointless matter. This is what happens when countries have too much money and peace. This quarrel is like an abcess that grows inside someone until it bursts and kills them, and no one knows why. (to the CAPTAIN) Thank you very much for the information, sir. 
###CAPTAIN
Good-bye, sir. 
##The CAPTAIN exits.
###ROSENCRANTZ
Will you please come now, my lord? 
###HAMLET
I’ll be there in a minute. Start without me. 
##Everyone except HAMLET exits.
My God! Everything I see shows me how wrong I am and tells me to hurry up and get on with my revenge. What is a human being if he just eats and sleeps? Nothing more than a beast. God didn’t create us with such a huge power of thought and a divine capacity for reason in order for us not to use them. Now, whether it’s animal-like mindlessness, or the cowardly hesitation 
that comes from thinking too much (thinking thoughts that are one part wisdom, three parts cowardice), I don’t know why I’m still alive to say “I have to do this deed” rather than having done it already. I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it. It’s as plain as the ground beneath my feet that I must do it. Look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince who’s so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his fragile life at risk, exposing it to danger and death, for a reason as thin as an eggshell. To be truly great doesn’t mean you’d only fight for a good reason. It means you’d fight over nothing if your honor was at stake. So where does that leave me, whose father has been murdered and mother defiled, ignoring these mental and emotional provocations and letting well enough alone? Meanwhile, to my shame, I watch twenty thousand men go marching to their deaths for an illusion and a little bit of fame, fighting for a tiny piece of land not even big enough to bury them all. From now on, if my thoughts aren’t violent I’ll consider them worthless. 
##He exits.
## HORATIO, GERTRUDE, and a GENTLEMAN enter.
###GERTRUDE
I won’t speak to her. 
###GENTLEMAN
She’s insistent. In fact, she’s crazed. You can’t help feeling sorry for her. 
###GERTRUDE
What does she want? 
###GENTLEMAN
She talks about her father a lot, and says she hears there are conspiracies around the world, and coughs, and beats her breast, and gets angry over tiny matters, and talks nonsense. Her words don’t mean anything, but her babbling causes her listeners to draw conclusions. They hear what they want to hear. Her winks and nods and gestures do suggest that she means to convey a message, and not a happy one. 
###HORATIO
It’s a good idea to speak to her, since she might lead those with evil intentions to dangerous conclusions. 
###GERTRUDE
Show her in. 
##The GENTLEMAN exits.
(to herself) To my sick soul (since sin is always a sickness), every detail looks like an omen of disaster to come. Guilt makes you so full of stupid suspicions that you give yourself away because you’re trying so hard not to. 
## OPHELIA enters, insane.
###OPHELIA
Where is the beautiful queen of Denmark? 
###GERTRUDE
What are you doing, Ophelia? 
###OPHELIA
(sings)  How can you tell the difference   Between your true lover and some other?  Your true one wears a pilgrim’s hat   And a pilgrim’s sandals and staff. 
###GERTRUDE
Oh heavens, what does that song mean, my dear? 
###OPHELIA
I’m sorry, did you say something? Please just listen. (sings)  He is dead and gone, lady,   He is dead and gone.  At his head is a patch of green grass,   And at his feet there is a tomb stone. Oh, ho! 
###GERTRUDE
No, Ophelia— 
###OPHELIA
Just listen, please. (sings)  His death shroud was as white as snow— 
## CLAUDIUS enters.
###GERTRUDE
My lord, look at this poor girl. 
###OPHELIA
(sings)   Covered with sweet flowers  Which did not fall to the ground   In true-love showers. 
###CLAUDIUS
How are you doing, my pretty lady? 
###OPHELIA
I’m quite well, and may God give you what you deserve. They say the baker’s daughter was turned into an owl for refusing Jesus' bread. My lord, we know what we are now, but not what we may become. May God be at your table. 
###CLAUDIUS
She’s talking about her dead father. 
###OPHELIA
Oh, let’s not talk about that, but when they ask you what it means, just say: (sings)  Tomorrow is St. Valentine’s Day   And early in the morning  I’m a girl below your window   Waiting to be your Valentine.  Then he got up and put on his clothes   And opened the door to his room.  He let in the girl, and when she left   She wasn’t a virgin anymore. 
###CLAUDIUS
Pretty Ophelia— 
###OPHELIA
Hang on, I’ll end it soon, I promise: (sings)  By the name of Jesus and Saint Charity,   My goodness, what a shame it is,  Young men will do it if they get a chance:   By God, they’re very bad.  She said, “Before you got me into bed,   You promised to marry me.”  He answers:  “I would have married you, I swear,   If you hadn’t gone to bed with me.” 
###CLAUDIUS
How long has she been like this? 
###OPHELIA
I hope everything will turn out fine. We must be patient, but I can’t help crying when I think of him being laid in the cold ground. My brother will hear about this. And so I thank you for your good advice. Come, driver! Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night. 
## OPHELIA exits.
###CLAUDIUS
Follow her. Keep an eye on her, please. 
## HORATIO exits.
Oh, her grief has poisoned her mind. Her father died and now look at her! Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude, when bad things happen, they don’t come one at a time, like enemy spies, but all at once like an army. First her father was killed, then your son was taken away—because of his own violent actions. The people are confused and spreading nasty rumors about Polonius’s death, and I was a fool to bury him in a hurry, without a proper state funeral. Poor Ophelia has been robbed of her sanity, without which we’re just pictures, or animals. Last but not least, her brother has secretly returned from France and is surrounded by gossip-mongers, who fill his ears with wicked stories about his father’s death. Deprived of proper evidence, he’ll naturally attribute the murder to me. Oh, dear Gertrude, I feel as though I’m being murdered many times over. 
##A noise offstage.
###GERTRUDE
Oh, no—what’s that noise? 
###CLAUDIUS
Listen! Where are my bodyguards? Let them guard the door. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
What is it? 
###MESSENGER
You must save yourself, my lord. The young Laertes, like the ocean when it floods the shore and devours the lowlands, is leading a rebellion against your government. The crowd calls him “lord” and shouts, “We want Laertes to be king!” It’s as if they were starting the world from scratch right now, throwing out the traditions and ancient customs that are the support of every word we utter. They throw their caps in the air and yell, “Laertes will be king! Laertes king!” 
###GERTRUDE
They sound so cheerful as they hunt down the wrong prey! Oh, you’re on the wrong track, you disloyal Danish dogs! 
##A noise offstage.
###CLAUDIUS
The doors have been smashed open. 
## LAERTES enters with others.
###LAERTES
Where’s this so-called king? Men, wait outside. 
###ALL
No, let us in! 
###LAERTES
Please wait. 
###ALL
All right, we will, we will. 
## LAERTES' FOLLOWERS exit.
###LAERTES
Thank you. Guard the door. (to CLAUDIUS) Oh, you vile king, give me my father! 
###GERTRUDE
Calm down, good Laertes. 
###LAERTES
I’ve got exactly one calm drop of blood in my body, and it proclaims that I’m a bastard, says my father was betrayed, and stamps the label “whore” on the pure forehead of my devoted mother. 
###CLAUDIUS
Laertes, what makes you so rebellious? Let him go, Gertrude. Don’t worry about my getting hurt. God protects the king, so traitors can’t hurt him.—Tell me, Laertes, why you’re so angry.—Gertrude, let him go.—Tell me, man. 
###LAERTES
Where’s my father? 
###CLAUDIUS
He’s dead. 
###GERTRUDE
But the king didn’t kill him. 
###CLAUDIUS
Let him ask what he wants to ask. 
###LAERTES
How did he end up dead? Don’t mess with me. To hell with my vows of allegiance to you! Vows can go to hell! Conscience, too! I don’t care if I’m damned. I don’t care what happens to me in this world or the next. Whatever happens, happens, but I’ll get revenge for my father’s murder. 
###CLAUDIUS
Who’s stopping you? 
###LAERTES
Only my free will—nothing else. What little means I have, I’ll use against you. 
###CLAUDIUS
My dear Laertes, in your eagerness to know the truth about your father’s death, are you determined to hurt your father’s friends and enemies alike? 
###LAERTES
No, only his enemies. 
###CLAUDIUS
Do you want to know who they are, then? 
###LAERTES
I’ll open my arms wide to his true friends, and like a mother pelican with her brood, I’ll even give my life for them. 
###CLAUDIUS
Why, now you’re talking like a good son and a true gentleman. I’ll prove to you as clearly as daylight that I’m innocent of your father’s death, and am struck with grief over it. 
##A voice offstage, “Let her in!”
###LAERTES
What’s that noise? 
## OPHELIA enters.
Oh, heat, dry up my brains! Salty tears, burn my eyes! By heaven, I’ll get revenge for your madness! Oh, you springtime rose, dear maiden, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! Is it possible that a young woman’s mind could fade away as easily as an old man’s life? Human nature is refined and thoughtful—person graciously gives a valuable part of herself away to her beloved, as Ophelia has sent off her sanity to her dead father. 
###OPHELIA
(sings)  They carried him uncovered in the coffin,   Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny.  And tears poured down into his grave. Good-bye, honey. 
###LAERTES
If you were sane and could urge me to take revenge, you couldn’t be more persuasive than you are now. 
###OPHELIA
You’re supposed to sing, “A down a-down,” and you, “Call him a-down-a.” Oh, how it turns around like a wheel! Like the worker who stole his boss’s daughter. 
###LAERTES
This nonsense means more than rational speech. 
###OPHELIA
Look at my flowers. There’s rosemary, that’s for remembering. Please remember, love. And there are pansies, they’re for thoughts. 
###LAERTES
A case study in madness, to connect memory and thought. 
###OPHELIA
(to GERTRUDE ) Here are fennel and columbines for you—they symbolize adultery. (to CLAUDIUS) And here’s rue for you—it symbolizes repentance. We can call it the merciful Sunday flower. You should wear it for a different reason. And here’s a daisy, for unhappy love. I’d give you some violets, flowers of faithfulness, but they all dried up when my father died. They say he looked good when he died. (sings) For good sweet Robin is all my joy. 
###LAERTES
Sadness and torment, suffering, hell itself—she makes them almost pretty. 
###OPHELIA
(sings)  And won’t he come again?  And won’t he come again?   No, no, he’s dead.   Go to your deathbed.  He’ll never come again.  His beard was white as snow,  His hair was all white too.   He’s gone, he’s gone,   And we moan as we’re cast away.  God have mercy on his soul. And on the souls of all good Christians, I hope. Goodbye, God be with you. 
## OPHELIA exits.
###LAERTES
Do you see this, oh, God? 
###CLAUDIUS
Laertes, I have a right to share your grief. Go choose your wisest friends, and have them listen to both of us and decide which of us is right. If directly or indirectly they find me implicated in your father’s murder, I’ll give up my kingdom, my crown, my life, and everything I call my own to you as restitution. But if they find me innocent, then be patient and I’ll work to satisfy to the fullest extent your deepest need for revenge. 
###LAERTES
All right, then. The way he died, his secret funeral, no funeral rites or military display, no noble rites or formal ceremony—shout out from heaven and earth that I must call the way he died into question. 
###CLAUDIUS
And you’re right to do so. May the guilty party be punished by death. Please, come with me. 
##They exit.
## HORATIO and a SERVANT enter.
###HORATIO
Who are the people who want to speak with me? 
###SERVANT
Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you. 
###HORATIO
Show them in. 
## SERVANT exits.
I don’t know who else would send me a letter from abroad except Hamlet. 
## SAILORS enter.
###SAILOR
Hello, sir. God bless you. 
###HORATIO
May He bless you, too. 
###SAILOR
He will, sir, if He wants to. There’s a letter for you, sir. It’s from the ambassador, Lord Hamlet, who was going to England—if your name’s Horatio, as they told me it is. (he hands HORATIO a letter) 
###HORATIO
(reading the letter)  “Horatio,  When you’ve read this letter, find a way to let these guys see the king. They have letters for him. Before we were at sea for even two days, a pirate ship equipped for battle pursued us. We were too slow to escape, so we were forced to stand and fight. In the battle that followed I ended up on the pirate ship. Just then they left our ship behind, so I became the only prisoner on board. They’ve treated me quite mercifully for thieves, but they knew what they were doing. They want me to do a favor for them. 
Give the king the letters I’ve sent, and come to me as fast as you would run from death. I’ve got things to tell you that will make you speechless, and they aren’t even half the story. These guys will take you to me. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are on their way to England. I have a lot to tell you about them. Good-bye.     Your trusted friend,      Hamlet.” Come, men. I’ll show you where to deliver these letters as quickly as possible, so that you can take me to the man who sent them. 
##They exit.
## CLAUDIUS and LAERTES enter.
###CLAUDIUS
Now you’ve got to acknowledge my innocence and believe I’m your friend, since you’ve heard and understood that the man who killed your father was trying to kill me. 
###LAERTES
It looks that way. But tell me why you didn’t take immediate action against his criminal acts, when your own safety and everything else would seem to call for it. 
###CLAUDIUS
Oh, for two main reasons which may seem weak to you, but strong to me. The queen, his mother, is devoted to him. And (for better or worse, whichever it is) she is such a part of my life and soul that I can’t live apart from her, any more than a planet can leave its orbit. The other reason why I couldn’t prosecute and arrest Hamlet is that the public loves him. In their affection they overlook all his faults. Like magic, they convert them into virtues, so whatever I said against him would end up hurting me, not him. 
###LAERTES
And so I’ve lost my noble father, had my sister driven insane—my sister who once was (if I can praise her for what she once was, not what she is now) the most perfect girl who ever lived. But I’ll get my revenge. 
###CLAUDIUS
Don’t you worry about that. You must not think that I’m so lazy and dull that I can be severely threatened and think it’s just a game. You’ll hear more about my plans soon enough. I loved your father, and I love myself, which should be enough to— 
##A MESSENGER enters with letters.
What is it? What’s the news? 
###MESSENGER
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This one’s for Your Highness, this one for the queen. (gives CLAUDIUS letters) 
###CLAUDIUS
From Hamlet? Who delivered them? 
###MESSENGER
Sailors, my lord, or so they say. I didn’t see them. Claudio gave them to me, and he got them from the one who delivered them. 
###CLAUDIUS
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say. Leave us alone now. 
##The MESSENGER exits.
(reads)  “High and Mighty one,  You know I’ve been set down naked, you might say, in your kingdom. Tomorrow I’ll beg permission to look into your kingly eyes, at which point I’ll tell you the story (after first apologizing) of how I came back to Denmark so strangely and suddenly.       Hamlet” 
What does this mean? Has everyone else come back too? Or is it all a lie—and no one has yet returned? 
###LAERTES
Do you recognize the handwriting? 
###CLAUDIUS
It’s Hamlet’s writing. “Naked,” he says. And in a P.S. he adds, “alone.” Can you help me out with this? 
###LAERTES
I have no clue, my lord. But let him come. It warms my weary heart to think I’ll get the chance to look him in the eye and say, “You did this.” 
###CLAUDIUS
If that’s how you feel, Laertes—and why shouldn’t you? Will you let me guide and direct you? 
###LAERTES
Yes, my lord, as long as you won’t lead me toward peace. 
###CLAUDIUS
No, just toward your own peace of mind. If he’s come back to Denmark without plans to continue on his trip, then I’ll trick him into an undertaking, which I’m working out now, that’s sure to kill him. When he dies, no one will be blamed, even his mother will call it an accident. 
###LAERTES
My lord, I’ll let you make the decision. I only ask to be in on your plans, the agent of his death. 
###CLAUDIUS
That’ll be fine. Since you left, people have been talking about—and within earshot of Hamlet—a certain quality of yours in which, they say, you shine. All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute. 
###LAERTES
What quality is that, my lord? 
###CLAUDIUS
A trivial little ribbon on the cap of youth—yet an important one, too, since casual clothes suit young people as much as serious business suits and overcoats suit the middle-aged. Two months ago I met a gentleman from Normandy. I’ve fought against the French and have seen how well they ride, but this man was a magician on horseback. It was as if he were part of the horse, so skillful that even having seen him, I can hardly conceive of the tricks he did. 
###LAERTES
Hmm, he was from Normandy, you say? 
###CLAUDIUS
Yes, from Normandy. 
###LAERTES
I bet it was Lamond. 
###CLAUDIUS
Yes, that’s the one. 
###LAERTES
I know him well. He’s his homeland’s jewel. 
###CLAUDIUS
He mentioned you to me, giving you such high marks in fencing that he exclaimed it would be a miracle if someone could match you. French fencers wouldn’t be good enough for you, he said, since they don’t have the right moves or skills. Hamlet was so jealous when he heard Lamond’s report that he talked about nothing else but having you come over and play against him. Now, the point is … 
###LAERTES
What’s the point, my lord? 
###CLAUDIUS
Laertes, did you love your father? Or is your grief just an illusion—a mere painting of sorrow? 
###LAERTES
How could you ask? 
###CLAUDIUS
Not that I suspect you didn’t love your father, but I’ve seen it happen that, as the days go by, time dampens the flame of love. The fire of love always burns itself out, and nothing stays the way it began. Even a good thing can grow too big and die from its own excess. We should do what we intend to do right when we intend it, since our intentions are subject to as many weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and accidents in life. And then all our “woulds” and “shoulds” are nothing but hot air. But back to my point: Hamlet’s coming back. What proof will you offer—in action, not just words—that you’re your father’s son? 
###LAERTES
I’ll cut Hamlet’s throat in church. 
###CLAUDIUS
It’s true, no place—not even a church—should offer refuge to that murderer. Revenge should have no limits. But Laertes, will you do this: stay in your room? When Hamlet comes home he’ll learn you’re here. I’ll have people praise your excellence and put a double coat on the fame the Frenchman gave you. In short, we’ll get you together and place bets on you. Hamlet’s so careless, high-minded, and unsuspecting that he won’t examine the swords beforehand, so you can easily choose one with a sharpened point and in one thrust avenge the death of your father. 
###LAERTES
I’ll do it, and I’ll put a little dab of something on my sword as well. From a quack doctor I bought some oil so poisonous that if you dip a knife in it, no medicine in the world can save the person who’s scratched by it. If I even graze his skin slightly, he’s likely to die. 
###CLAUDIUS
Let’s think about this, and consider what time and what method will be most appropriate. If our plan were to fail, and people found out about it, it would be better never to have tried it. We should have a backup ready in case the first plan doesn’t work. Let me think. We’ll place bets on you and Hamlet—that’s it! When the two of you have gotten all sweaty and hot—keep him jumping around a lot for that purpose—Hamlet will ask for something to drink. I’ll have a cup ready for him. If by chance he 
escapes your poisoned sword tip, the drink will kill him. But wait, what’s that sound? 
## GERTRUDE enters.
###GERTRUDE
The bad news just keeps on coming, one disaster after another. Your sister’s drowned, Laertes. 
###LAERTES
Drowned? Oh, where? 
###GERTRUDE
There’s a willow that leans over the brook, dangling its white leaves over the glassy water. Ophelia made wild wreaths out of those leaves, braiding in crowflowers, thistles, daisies, and the orchises that vulgar shepherds have an obscene name for, but which pure-minded girls call “dead men’s fingers.” Climbing into the tree to hang the wreath of weeds on the hanging branches, she and her flowers fell into the gurgling brook. Her clothes spread out wide in the water, and buoyed her up for a while as she sang bits of old hymns, acting like someone who doesn’t realize the danger she’s in, or like someone completely accustomed to danger. But it was only a matter of time before her clothes, heavy with the water they absorbed, pulled the poor thing out of her song, down into the mud at the bottom of the brook. 
###LAERTES
So she is drowned. 
###GERTRUDE
Drowned, drowned. 
###LAERTES
You’ve had too much water already, poor Ophelia, so I won’t shed watery tears for you. But crying is what humans do. We do what’s in our nature, even if we’re ashamed of it. After I stop crying I’ll be through acting like a woman. Good-bye, my lord. I have some fiery words I could speak now, but my foolish tears are drowning them out. 
## LAERTES exits.
###CLAUDIUS
Let’s follow him, Gertrude. I worked so hard to calm him down, and now I’m worried he’s getting all excited again. Let’s follow him. 
##They exit.
##A GRAVEDIGGER and the OTHER gravedigger enter.
###GRAVEDIGGER
Are they really going to give her a Christian burial after she killed herself? 
###OTHER
I’m telling you, yes. So finish that grave right away. The coroner examined her case and says it should be a Christian funeral. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
But how, unless she drowned in self-defense? 
###OTHER
That’s what they’re saying she did. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Sounds more like “self-offense,” if you ask me. What I’m saying is, if she knew she was drowning herself, then that’s an act. An act has three sides to it: to do, to act, and to perform. Therefore she must have known she was drowning herself. 
###OTHER
No, listen here, gravedigger sir— 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Let me finish. Here’s the water, right? And here’s a man, okay? If the man goes into the water and drowns himself, he’s the one doing it, like it or not. But if the water comes to him and drowns him, then he doesn’t drown himself. Therefore, he who is innocent of his own death does not shorten his own life. 
###OTHER
Is that how the law sees it? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
It sure is. The coroner’s inquest law. 
###OTHER
Do you want to know the truth? If this woman hadn’t been rich, she wouldn’t have been given a Christian burial. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Well there, now you’ve said it. It’s a pity that the rich have more freedom to hang or drown themselves than the rest of us Christians. Come on, shovel. The most ancient aristocrats in the world are gardeners, ditch-diggers, and gravediggers. They keep up Adam’s profession. 
###OTHER
Was he an aristocrat? With a coat of arms? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
He was the first person who ever had arms. 
###OTHER
He didn’t have any. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
What, aren’t you a Christian? The Bible says Adam dug in the ground. How could he dig without arms? I’ll ask you another question. If you can’t answer it— 
###OTHER
Go ahead! 
###GRAVEDIGGER
What do you call a person who builds stronger things than a stonemason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter does? 
###OTHER
The one who builds the gallows to hang people on, since his structure outlives a thousand inhabitants. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
You’re funny, and I like that. The gallows do a good job. But how? It does a good job for those who do bad. 
Now, it’s wrong to say that the gallows are stronger than a church. Therefore, the gallows may do you some good. Come on, your turn. 
###OTHER
Let’s see, “Who builds stronger things than a stonemason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?” 
###GRAVEDIGGER
That’s the question, so answer it. 
###OTHER
Ah, I’ve got it! 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Go ahead. 
###OTHER
Damn, I forgot. 
## HAMLET and HORATIO enter in the distance.
###GRAVEDIGGER
Don’t beat your brains out over it. You can’t make a slow donkey run by beating it. The next time someone asks you this riddle, say “a gravedigger.” The houses he makes last till Judgment Day. Now go and get me some booze. 
##The OTHER GRAVEDIGGER exits.
(the GRAVEDIGGER digs and sings)  In my youth I loved, I loved,   And I thought it was very sweet  To set—ohh—the date for—ahh—my duty   Oh, I thought it—ahh—was not right. 
###HAMLET
Doesn’t this guy realize what he’s doing? He’s singing while digging a grave. 
###HORATIO
He’s gotten so used to graves that they don’t bother him anymore. 
###HAMLET
Yes, exactly. Only people who don’t have to work can afford to be sensitive. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
(sings)  But old age has sneaked up on me   And grabbed me in his claws,  And has shipped me into the ground   As if I’d never been like that. (he throws up a skull) 
###HAMLET
That skull had a tongue in it once and could sing. That jackass is throwing it around as if it belonged to Cain, who did the first murder! It might be the skull of a politician once capable of talking his way around God, right? And now this idiot is pulling rank on him. 
###HORATIO
Indeed, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Or a courtier, who could say things like, “Good night, my sweet lord! How are you doing, good lord?” This might be the skull of Lord So-and-So, who praised Lord Such-and-Such’s horse when he wanted to borrow it, right? 
###HORATIO
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Exactly. And now it’s the property of Lady Worm, its lower jaw knocked off and thwacked on the noggin with a shovel. That’s quite a reversal of fortune, isn’t it, if we could only see it? Are these bones worth nothing more than bowling pins now? It makes my bones ache to think about it. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
(sings)  A pickax and a shovel, a shovel,   And a sheet for a funeral shroud,  Oh, a pit of dirt is what we need   For a guest like this one here. (he throws up another skull) 
###HAMLET
There’s another. Could that be a lawyer’s skull? Where’s all his razzle-dazzle legal jargon now? Why does he allow this idiot to knock him on the head with a dirty shovel, instead of suing him for assault and battery? Maybe this guy was once a great landowner, with his deeds and contracts, his tax shelters and his annuities. Is it part of his deed of ownership to have his skull filled up with dirt? Does he only get to keep as much land as a set of contracts would cover if you spread them out on the ground? The deeds to his properties would barely fit in this coffin—and the coffin’s all the property he gets to keep? 
###HORATIO
No more than that, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Isn’t the parchment of a legal document made of sheepskin? 
###HORATIO
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too. 
###HAMLET
Anyone who puts his trust in such documents is a sheep or a calf. I’ll talk to this guy.—Excuse me, sir, whose grave is this? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
It’s mine, sir. 
(sings)  Oh, a pit of dirt is what we need  For a guest like this one here. 
###HAMLET
I think it really must be yours, since you’re the one lying in it. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
And you’re lying outside of it, so it’s not yours. As for me, I’m not lying to you in it—it’s really mine. 
###HAMLET
But you are lying in it, being in it and saying it’s yours. It’s for the dead, not the living. So you’re lying. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
That’s a lively lie, sir—it jumps so fast from me to you. 
###HAMLET
What man are you digging it for? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
For no man, sir. 
###HAMLET
What woman, then? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
For no woman, either. 
###HAMLET
Who’s to be buried in it? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
One who used to be a woman but—bless her soul—is dead now. 
###HAMLET
How literal this guy is! We have to speak precisely, or he’ll get the better of us with his wordplay. Lord, Horatio, I’ve been noticing this for a few years now. The peasants have become so clever and witty that they’re nipping at the heels of noblemen.—How long have you been a gravedigger? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Of all the days in the year, I started the day that the late King Hamlet defeated Fortinbras. 
###HAMLET
How long ago was that? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
You don’t know that? Any fool could tell you, it was the day that young Hamlet was born—the one who went crazy and got sent off to England. 
###HAMLET
Why was he sent to England? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Because he was crazy. He’ll recover his sanity there. Or if he doesn’t, it won’t matter in England. 
###HAMLET
Why not? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Because nobody will notice he’s crazy. Everyone there is as crazy as he is. 
###HAMLET
How did he go crazy? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
In a strange way, they say. 
###HAMLET
What do you mean, “in a strange way”? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
By losing his mind. 
###HAMLET
On what grounds? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Right here in Denmark. I’ve been the church warden here for thirty years, since childhood. 
###HAMLET
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Well, if he’s not rotten before he dies (and there are a lot of people now who are so rotten they start falling to pieces even before you put them in the coffin), he’ll last eight or nine years. A leathermaker will last nine years. 
###HAMLET
Why does he last longer? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Because his hide is so leathery from his trade that he keeps the water off him a long time, and water is what makes your goddamn body rot more than anything. Here’s a skull that’s been here twenty-three years. 
###HAMLET
Whose was it? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
A crazy bastard. Who do you think? 
###HAMLET
I really don’t know. 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Damn that crazy madman! He poured a pitcher of white wine on my head once. This is the skull of Yorick, the king’s jester. 
###HAMLET
This one? 
###GRAVEDIGGER
Yes, that one. 
###HAMLET
Let me see. (he takes the skull) Oh, poor Yorick! I used to know him, Horatio—a very funny guy, and with an excellent imagination. He carried me on his back a thousand times, and now—how terrible—this is him. It makes my stomach turn. I don’t know how many times I kissed the lips that used to be right here. Where are your jokes now? Your pranks? Your songs? Your flashes of wit that used to set the whole table laughing? You don’t make anybody smile now. Are you sad about that? You need to go to my lady’s room and tell her that no matter how much makeup she slathers on, she’ll end up just like you some day. That’ll make her laugh. Horatio, tell me something. 
###HORATIO
What’s that, my lord? 
###HAMLET
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried? 
###HORATIO
Exactly like that. 
###HAMLET
And smelled like that, too? Whew! (he puts down the skull) 
###HORATIO
Just as bad, my lord. 
###HAMLET
How low we can fall, Horatio. Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel? 
###HORATIO
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much. 
###HAMLET
No, not at all. Just follow the logic: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returned to dust, the dust is dirt, and dirt makes mud we use to stop up holes. So why can’t someone plug a beer barrel with the dirt that used to be Alexander? The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away. Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall! But quiet, be quiet a minute. 
## CLAUDIUS enters with GERTRUDE, LAERTES, and a coffin, with a PRIEST and other lords attendant.
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court. Who are they following? And with such a plain and scrawny ceremony? It means the corpse they’re following took its own life. Must have been from a wealthy family. Let’s stay and watch a while. 
## HAMLET and HORATIO step aside.
###LAERTES
What other rites are you going to give her? 
###HAMLET
That’s Laertes, a very noble young man. Listen. 
###LAERTES
What other rites are you going to give her? 
###PRIEST
I’ve performed as many rites as I’m permitted. Her death was suspicious, and were it not for the fact that the king gave orders to bury her here, she’d have been buried outside the church graveyard. She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body. But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her. 
###LAERTES
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform? 
###PRIEST
No, nothing. We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them. 
###LAERTES
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh! I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell. 
###HAMLET
(to HORATIO) What, the beautiful Ophelia? 
###QUEEN
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl. Goodbye! (she scatters flowers) I once hoped you’d be my Hamlet’s wife. I thought I’d be tossing flowers on your wedding bed, my sweet girl, not on your grave. 
###LAERTES
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind. Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more. 
##(he jumps into the grave)
Now pile the dirt onto the living and the dead alike, till you’ve made a mountain higher thanMount Pelion or Mount Olympus. 
###HAMLET
(coming forward) Who is the one whose grief is so loud and clear, whose words of sadness make the planets stand still in the heavens as if they’ve been hurt by what they’ve heard? It’s me, Hamlet the Dane. (he jumps into the grave) 
###LAERTES
To hell with your soul! 
## HAMLET and LAERTES wrestle with each other.
###HAMLET
That’s no way to pray. (they fight) Please take your hands off my throat. I may not be rash and quick to anger, but I have something dangerous in me which you should beware of. Take your hands off. 
###CLAUDIUS
Pull them apart. 
###GERTRUDE
Hamlet! Hamlet! 
###ALL
Gentlemen! 
###HORATIO
(to HAMLET ) Please, my lord, calm down. 
##Attendants separate HAMLET and LAERTES 
###HAMLET
I’ll fight him over this issue till I don’t have the strength to blink. 
###GERTRUDE
Oh, my son, what issue is that? 
###HAMLET
I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine. What are you going to do for her? 
###CLAUDIUS
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes! 
###GERTRUDE
For the love of God, be patient with him. 
###HAMLET
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her. Will you cry? Fight? Stop eating? Cut yourself? Drink vinegar? Eat a crocodile? I’ll do all that. Did you come here to whine? To outdo me by jumping into her grave so theatrically? To be buried alive with her? So will I. And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us. It will be so high a peak that it scrapes against heaven and makes Mount Ossa look like a wart. See? I can talk crazy as well as you. 
###GERTRUDE
This is pure insanity. He’ll be like this for a little while. Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch. 
###HAMLET
Listen, sir, why do you treat me like this? I always loved you. But it doesn’t matter. Even a hero like Hercules can’t keep cats from acting like cats, and dogs like dogs. 
## HAMLET exits.
###CLAUDIUS
Please, Horatio, go with him. 
## HORATIO exits.
(to LAERTES) Don’t forget our talk last night, and try to be patient. We’ll take care of this problem soon.—Gertrude, have the guards keep an eye on your son. A monument shall be built for Ophelia that will last forever, I promise. We’ll have the quiet we need soon. In the meantime, let’s proceed patiently. 
##They exit.
## HAMLET and HORATIO enter.
###HAMLET
That’s enough about that. Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey. Do you remember the circumstances? 
###HORATIO
How could I forget, my lord! 
###HAMLET
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep. It was worse than being a captive in chains. Sometimes it’s good to be rash—sometimes it works out well to act impulsively when our careful plans lose steam. This should show us that there’s a God in heaven who’s always guiding us in the right direction, however often we screw up— 
###HORATIO
Well, of course. 
###HAMLET
So I came up from my cabin with my robe tied around me, groped in the dark to find what I was looking for, found it, looked through their packet of papers, and returned to my cabin again. I was bold enough (I guess my fears made me forget my manners) to open the document containing the king’s instructions. And there I found, Horatio, such royal mischief—a precisely worded order, sugared with lots of talk about Denmark’s well-being and England’s too, to cut off my head, without even waiting to sharpen the ax. 
###HORATIO
Is it possible? 
###HAMLET
(he shows HORATIO a document) Here’s the document. Read it in your free time. But do you want to hear what I did then? 
###HORATIO
Yes, please tell me. 
###HAMLET
So there I was, caught in their evil net. Before I could even start processing the situation, they had started the ball rolling. I sat down and wrote out a new official document with new instructions. I wrote it in a bureaucrat’s neat handwriting. I used to think having nice handwriting was for servants, just like our politicians think, and I had to work hard to overcome that prejudice—but it sure came in handy then. Do you want to know what I wrote? 
###HORATIO
Yes, my lord. 
###HAMLET
A sincere plea from the king, who commands the respect of England, and who hopes that the love between the two countries can flourish, and that peace can join them in friendship—and other fancy mumbo jumbo like that—saying that, once they read this document, without any debate, the ones delivering the letter should be put to death immediately, without giving them time to confess to a priest. 
###HORATIO
But how could you put an official seal on it? 
###HAMLET
Heaven helped me out with that too. I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it. I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference. The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that. 
###HORATIO
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it. 
###HAMLET
Man, they were asking for it. I don’t feel guilty about them at all. They got what they deserved. It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents. 
###HORATIO
What a king Claudius is! 
###HAMLET
Don’t you think it’s my duty now to kill him with this weapon? This man who killed my king, made my mother a whore, took the throne that I hoped for, and set a trap to kill me. Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience? And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm? 
###HORATIO
He’ll find out soon what happened in England. 
###HAMLET
Soon enough. But I have the meantime. A human life is hardly long enough to count to one in. But I really feel bad, Horatio, about losing control of myself with Laertes. His situation is very much like my own. I’ll be nice to him. It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury. 
###HORATIO
Hang on a minute—who are you? 
## OSRIC, a young courtier, enters with his hat in his hand.
###OSRIC
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord. 
###HAMLET
Thank you kindly, sir. (speaking so that only HORATIO can hear) Do you know this insect? 
###HORATIO
(speaking so that only HAMLET can hear) No, my lord. 
###HAMLET
(speaking so that only HORATIO can hear) You’re lucky, since knowing him is most unpleasant. He owns a lot of good land. Give an animal a lot of money, and he’ll be welcome at the king’s table. He’s a jerk, but he owns a whole lot of dirt, so he’s treated well. 
###OSRIC
My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty. 
###HAMLET
I’ll hang on every word you say. Put your hat back on, where it belongs: it’s for your head, not for your hands to hold. 
###OSRIC
No thank you, my lord. It’s very hot. 
###HAMLET
No, I’m telling you, it’s very cold, with a northerly wind. 
###OSRIC
It is rather cold, indeed, my lord. 
###HAMLET
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion. 
###OSRIC
Yes indeed it is, sir. Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is. My lord, His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you. This is what it’s all about— 
###HAMLET
Please, I beg you—(he points to OSRIC ’s hat) 
###OSRIC
No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you. Sir, there’s someone named Laertes who’s recently come to the court. He’s an absolute gentleman, totally outstanding in so many respects, very easy in society, and displaying all his excellent qualities. If I were to expose my true feelings about him, I’d have to say he’s like a business card for the upper classes—he’s that wonderful. You’ll find that he’s the sum total of what a perfect gentleman should be. 
###HAMLET
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him. 
Speaking the very truth of high praise, I can honestly say that I find him to possess a soul of such great importance, and so rare and unique in every respect, that—to speak the absolute truth—he can find an equal only when he gazes into a mirror. Anyone else is just a pale copy of him. 
###OSRIC
You speak absolutely correctly, sir. 
###HAMLET
And what’s the point, sir? Why are we talking about him like this? 
###OSRIC
Sorry, sir? 
###HORATIO
(speaking so that only HAMLET can hear) Can’t you talk to him in a different way? 
###HAMLET
(to OSRIC) What is the significance of referring to this individual? 
###OSRIC
Laertes, you mean? 
###HORATIO
(speaking so that only HAMLET can hear) All his fancy language has run out finally; his pockets are empty. 
###HAMLET
Yes, Laertes, sir. 
###OSRIC
I know you know something— 
###HAMLET
Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that. But in fact it doesn’t say much. I’m sorry, you were saying? 
###OSRIC
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is— 
###HAMLET
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine. But knowing a person well is a bit like knowing oneself. 
###OSRIC
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir. His reputation in fencing is unrivaled. 
###HAMLET
What kind of weapon does he use? 
###OSRIC
The rapier and the dagger. 
###HAMLET
Those are only two of his weapons. But, go on. 
###OSRIC
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories. Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories. 
###HAMLET
What do you mean by “carriages”? 
###HORATIO
(speaking so that only HAMLET can hear) I knew you’d have to look something up in the dictionary before we were finished. 
###OSRIC
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang. 
###HAMLET
“Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon. I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway. Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish. Why has all this been put on the table? 
###OSRIC
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits. You could get started immediately if you’ll give me your answer. 
###HAMLET
But what if my answer’s no? 
###OSRIC
I mean, if you’d agree to play against Laertes, sir. 
###HAMLET
Sir, I’m going to go for a walk in the hall here whether the king likes it or not. It’s my exercise time. Bring in the swords, if the king still wants to go through with it and if Laertes is still willing. I’ll have the king win his bet if I can. If not, I’ll only have suffered some embarrassment and a few sword hits. 
###OSRIC
Shall I quote you in those exact words, sir? 
###HAMLET
Just get the point across, however flowery you want to be. 
###OSRIC
My services are at your command. 
###HAMLET
Thank you. 
## OSRIC exits.
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself. No one else would. 
###HORATIO
That crazy bird’s only half-hatched. 
###HAMLET
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it. He’s like so many successful people in these trashy times—he’s patched together enough fancy phrases and trendy opinions to carry him along. But blow a little on this bubbly talk, and it’ll burst. There’s no substance here. 
##A LORD enters.
###LORD
My lord, Osric has told the king about your agreeing to the fencing match. The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile. 
###HAMLET
I’ll do whatever the king wants. If he’s ready now, so am I. Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able. 
###LORD
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else. 
###HAMLET
Right on cue. 
###LORD
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match. 
##The LORD exits.
###HAMLET
She’s full of good advice. 
###HORATIO
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord. 
###HAMLET
I don’t think so. I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France. With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win. But I have a sinking feeling anyway. Oh well. 
###HORATIO
Wait, my lord— 
###HAMLET
I know I’m being foolish, but I have the kind of vague misgiving women often get. 
###HORATIO
If something is telling you not to play, listen to it. I’ll say you’re not feeling well. 
###HAMLET
You’ll do no such thing. I thumb my nose at superstitions. God controls everything—even something as trivial as a sparrow’s death. Everything will work out as it is destined. If something is supposed to happen now, it will. If it’s supposed to happen later, it won’t happen now. What’s important is to be prepared. Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early? Let it be. 
## CLAUDIUS enters with GERTRUDE, LAERTES, OSRIC, lords, and other attendants with trumpets, drums, fencing swords, a table, and pitchers of wine.
###CLAUDIUS
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet. (CLAUDIUS places LAERTES' and HAMLET’s hands together) 
###HAMLET
(to LAERTES) I beg your pardon, sir. I’ve done you wrong. Forgive me as a gentleman. Everyone here knows—and I’m sure you’ve heard—that I’m suffering from a serious mental illness. When I insulted you it was due to insanity. Was Hamlet the one who insulted Laertes? No, not Hamlet. If Hamlet is robbed of his own mind, and insults Laertes when he’s not really himself, then Hamlet’s not guilty of the offense. Who is guilty, then? Hamlet’s mental illness is. 
And if that’s true, then Hamlet is the victim of his own illness—his illness is his enemy. Sir, with this audience as witness, let me declare that I’m as innocent of premeditated evil against you as I would be if I had happened to shoot an arrow over my house and accidentally hit my brother. 
###LAERTES
My feelings are satisfied—even though what you have done to my father and sister should drive me to revenge. Yet when it comes to my honor, I can’t forgive you so fast. I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so. Until then I will accept your love as love. 
###HAMLET
I’m grateful for your love. Come on, give us the swords, and we will play this friendly fencing match enthusiastically. 
###LAERTES
Yes, hand me one too. 
###HAMLET
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes. I’m so bad at the game that your skill will shine like the brightest star in the darkest night. 
###LAERTES
You’re making fun of me. 
###HAMLET
No, I swear I’m not. 
###CLAUDIUS
Give them the swords, Osric. Hamlet, you know the bet? 
###HAMLET
Yes, my lord, quite well. You’ve bet on the weaker fencer. 
###CLAUDIUS
I’m not worried. I’ve seen both of you fence. But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap. He’s got to outdo you by three hits to win. 
###LAERTES
This sword’s too heavy. Show me another one. 
###HAMLET
I like this one. Are they all the same length? 
###OSRIC
Yes, my lord. 
## HAMLET and LAERTES get ready to fence.
###CLAUDIUS
Put the goblets of wine on that table. If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute. I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings. Give me the goblets. And now let the drum and the trumpet play, and the trumpet signal the cannon outside to fire, and let the cannon tell the heavens, and the heavens tell all the earth that the king is drinking now to Hamlet’s health. Come on, let’s begin. Judges, pay close attention. 
##Trumpets play.
###HAMLET
Come on, sir. 
###LAERTES
Come on, my lord. 
## HAMLET and LAERTES fence.
###HAMLET
That was one hit. 
###LAERTES
No, it wasn’t. 
###HAMLET
Referee! 
###OSRIC
It was obviously a hit. 
###LAERTES
Well, let’s go on. 
###CLAUDIUS
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours. Here’s to your health. 
##Drums and trumpets play, and a gun is fired.
## CLAUDIUS drops a pearl into a cup.
Give him the goblet. 
###HAMLET
Let me just finish this round. Set it down awhile. Let’s play. 
## HAMLET and LAERTES fence.
Another hit. What do you say? 
###LAERTES
You got me, I admit it. 
###CLAUDIUS
My son will win. 
###GERTRUDE
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead. The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet. (she lifts the cup with the pearl) 
###HAMLET
Thank you, madam. 
###CLAUDIUS
Gertrude, don’t drink that. 
###GERTRUDE
Excuse me. I’ll drink it if I like. (she drinks) 
###CLAUDIUS
(to himself) That was the poisoned drink. It’s too late. 
###HAMLET
I’d better not drink now. I’ll drink later. 
###GERTRUDE
Come on, let me wipe your face. 
###LAERTES
(to CLAUDIUS) I’ll get him now. 
###CLAUDIUS
I doubt it. 
###LAERTES
(to himself) But I almost feel guilty. 
###HAMLET
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes. You’re just playing around. Come on, give me your best shot. I sense you’re treating me like a child. 
###LAERTES
You think so? Come on. 
## HAMLET and LAERTES fence.
###OSRIC
They’re neck and neck. 
###LAERTES
Take this! 
## LAERTES wounds HAMLET. Then in a scuffle they end up with each other’s swords, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES.
###CLAUDIUS
Separate them. They’re overdoing it. 
###HAMLET
No, come on, one more time. 
## GERTRUDE collapses.
###OSRIC
Take care of the queen! 
###HORATIO
Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord? 
###OSRIC
How do you feel, Laertes? 
###LAERTES
Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric. (he collapses) I’ve been killed by my own evil tricks. 
###HAMLET
How’s the queen? 
###CLAUDIUS
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding. 
###GERTRUDE
No, no, the drink, the drink! Oh, my dear Hamlet! The drink, the drink! I’ve been poisoned. (she dies) 
###HAMLET
Oh, what evil! Lock the door. 
## OSRIC exits
We’ve been betrayed! Find out who did it! 
###LAERTES
I’m the one, Hamlet. Hamlet, you’re dead. No medicine in the world can cure you. You don’t have more than half an hour to live. The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison. The foul plan backfired on me. Here I lie and will never get up again. Your mother’s been poisoned. I can’t speak anymore. The king, the king’s to blame. 
###HAMLET
The blade poisoned! Then get to work, poison! 
## HAMLET wounds CLAUDIUS.
###ALL
Treason! Treason! 
###CLAUDIUS
Protect me, my friends. I’ve only been hurt, not killed. 
###HAMLET
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this. Is your little pearl in there? Follow my mother. 
## HAMLET forces CLAUDIUS to drink. CLAUDIUS dies.
###LAERTES
He got what he deserved. He mixed that poison himself. Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet. You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours. (he dies) 
###HAMLET
God will free you from blame. I’ll follow you to heaven in a minute.—I’m dying, Horatio.—Goodbye, miserable queen.—And all you people watching, pale and trembling, speechless spectators of these acts, I could tell you a thing or two if I had the time (though this cruel officer, Death, doesn’t allow much free time). Let it be.—Horatio, I’m dying. You’re alive. Tell everyone what happened; set the story straight. 
###HORATIO
Not for a second. I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane. Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet. (he picks up the poisoned cup to drink) 
###HAMLET
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me. Let go of it! I’ll get it from you, I swear. Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth. If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story. 
##A military march is heard from offstage, and a cannon fires.
What are these warlike noises? 
## OSRIC enters.
###OSRIC
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors. 
###HAMLET
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio! This strong poison’s overpowering me. I will not live to hear the news from England. But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown. He’s got my vote as I die. So tell him that, given the recent events here—oh, the rest is silence. Oh, oh, oh, oh. (he dies) 
###HORATIO
Now a noble heart is breaking. Good night, sweet prince. May hosts of angels sing you to sleep.—Why are those drums approaching? 
## FORTINBRAS and the English AMBASSADOR enter with a drummer and attendants.
###FORTINBRAS
What do I see here? 
###HORATIO
What would you like to see? If it’s a tragedy, you’ve come to the right place. 
###FORTINBRAS
These corpses suggest mayhem. Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke? 
###AMBASSADOR
This is a horrible sight. Our news arrives from England too late, since the people that should have heard it are dead. We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Who will thank us now? 
###HORATIO
(indicates CLAUDIUS) Not the king, even if he were still alive to thank you. He never ordered their deaths. But since you’ve come so soon after this bloodbath, you from battles in Poland and you from England, then give your men orders to display these corpses on a high platform, and let me tell the world how all this happened.You’ll hear of violent and unnatural acts, terrible accidents, casual murders, deaths caused by trickery and by threat, and finally murderous plans that backfired on their perpetrators. All this I can explain. 
###FORTINBRAS
Let’s hear about it right away and invite all the noblemen to listen. As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness. I have some rights to claim this kingdom, and by arriving at this moment I have an opportunity to put them into effect. 
###HORATIO
I also have a few things to say about that, which Hamlet just told me. But let’s get down to business—even though people are in a frenzy of grief—to avoid any further plots and mishaps. 
###FORTINBRAS
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage. He would have been a great king if he had had the chance to prove himself. Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities. Pick up the corpses. A sight like this suits a battlefield, but here at court it shows that much went wrong. Go outside and tell the soldiers to fire their guns in honor of Hamlet. 
##They exit marching, carrying the bodies. Cannons are fired.

## ORLANDO and ADAM enter.
###ORLANDO
I remember, Adam, that’s exactly why my father only left me a thousand crowns in his will. And as you know, my father commanded my brother, Oliver, to make sure that I was brought up well—and that’s where my sadness begins. Oliver keeps my brother Jaques away at school, and everyone says he’s doing extremely well there. But he keeps me at home in the country—to be precise, he keeps me stuck at home but doesn’t support me. I ask you, is this any way to treat a gentleman as nobly born as I am, to pen me in like an ox? His horses get treated better than I do—at least he feeds them and trains them properly, and spends a lot of money on trainers for them. All I’ve gained from his care is weight, which makes me as indebted to him as his animals on the manure pile are. He gives me plenty of nothing, and takes away everything else, letting me eat with his servants, refusing me what’s owed me as his brother, and ruining my good birth with a poor education. This is what angers me, Adam. My father’s temper and spirit, which I think I share, makes me want to mutiny against my brother’s tyranny. I won’t stand for it any longer, though I haven’t yet figured out how to revolt. 
## OLIVER enters.
###ADAM
Here comes my master, your brother. 
###ORLANDO
Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me. 
###OLIVER
Hey, you! What are you making here? 
###ORLANDO
Nothing. I’ve never been taught how to make anything. 
###OLIVER
Well, then, what are you messing up? 
###ORLANDO
I’m helping you mess up one of God’s creations—your poor, unworthy brother—by having him do nothing. 
###OLIVER
Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while. 
###ORLANDO
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them? When did I waste so much money that I ended up this poor? 
###OLIVER
Do you know where you are, sir? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard. 
###OLIVER
Do you know whom you’re talking to? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, better than you know me. I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect. But we’re in the same family, so you should acknowledge that I am a gentleman too. According to custom, as the first-born you are my superior. But it’s not customary to treat me like I’m not even a gentleman, even if there were twenty brothers between you and me. I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older. 
###OLIVER
(hitting ORLANDO) What nerve! 
###ORLANDO
(grabbing hold of OLIVER) Come on, big brother; you don’t know anything about fighting. 
###OLIVER
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain? 
###ORLANDO
I’m no villain. I’m the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, and anyone who claims my father’s sons are villains is a villain himself. If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this. You’ve only insulted yourself. 
###ADAM
Gentlemen, calm down. For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace. 
###OLIVER
Let me go, I say. 
###ORLANDO
I won’t until I’m ready. You will listen to me. My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education. But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman. My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer. Either give me the freedom to act like someone of my own rank or give me my share of the inheritance, so that I can seek my fortune elsewhere. 
###OLIVER
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money? Beg? Well, sir, go inside. I’m not going to be bothered by you for long. You’ll get some of what you want. Now please leave me alone. 
###ORLANDO
I won’t bother you any more than necessary. 
###OLIVER
(to ADAM) And you get lost too, you old dog. 
###ADAM
Is that my reward—to be called “old dog?” Well, it’s true, I’ve served this family so long I’ve gotten old and toothless, like a dog. God bless my old master. He would never have spoken to me like this. 
## ORLANDO and ADAM exit.
###OLIVER
Is that how it’s going to be? Are you starting to challenge me? I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis! 
## DENNIS enters.
###DENNIS
Did you call for me, your Worship? 
###OLIVER
Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me? 
###DENNIS
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you. 
###OLIVER
Call him in. 
## DENNIS exits.
I have a good plan. And tomorrow is the wrestling match. 
## CHARLES enters.
###CHARLES
Good morning, sir. 
###OLIVER
Good Mr. Charles! Tell me, what’s the latest news at the new court? 
###CHARLES
No news but the old news: the old Duke Senior has been banished by his younger brother, the new Duke Frederick. A few loyal lords have gone into exile with Duke Senior, and given up their lands and money to Frederick—so he’s happy enough to have them leave. 
###OLIVER
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished? 
###CHARLES
Oh, no. Duke Frederick’s daughter, Celia, grew up with Rosalind, and Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have either followed her into exile or died of grief. Rosalind has stayed at court, where Duke Frederick loves her like his own daughter. No two women ever loved each other like they do. 
###OLIVER
Where will the old duke live? 
###CHARLES
They say he’s already in the Forest of Arden. He has many cheerful men with him, and they live like Robin Hood and his outlaws. People say that new batches of young men flock there every day, and that they all pass the time without a care, like people did in the Golden Age. 
###OLIVER
So, are you going to wrestle before the new duke tomorrow? 
###CHARLES
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem. I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise. Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed. Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me. I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine. 
###OLIVER
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you. I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined. I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother. So use your discretion. I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger. And you’d better be careful, because if you embarrass him at all—in fact, if he doesn’t beat you thoroughly—he’ll come after you and won’t leave you alone till he’s poisoned you or trapped you—killed you, in other words, one way or another. It brings me to tears to say this, but there isn’t another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked. Because he’s my brother, I have to take his side. But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking. 
###CHARLES
I’m very glad I came to see you. If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him. If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again. Farewell, my lord. 
###OLIVER
Take care, Charles. 
## CHARLES exits.
Now it’s time to get this playboy brother of mine all worked up. I hope I’ll see the end of him soon—I don’t know why, but I hate nothing in the world as much as him, though he’s an upstanding guy. He’s never gone to school but he’s smart, with good values, and everyone is delighted by him and loves him, especially my subjects, who know him the best. They love him, and therefore they despise me. But not for long; Charles will take care of everything. All I have to do is get Orlando to fight, which I’ll do now. 
##He exits.
## CELIA and ROSALIND enter.
###CELIA
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy. 
###ROSALIND
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier? Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy. 
###CELIA
Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you. If your father had banished my father, I could have learned to love your father as my own, as long as I still had you. You’d do the same, if your love for me were as true as mine for you. 
###ROSALIND
Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours. 
###CELIA
You know I’m my father’s only child, and he isn’t likely to have another. And when he dies, you will inherit his fortune—because whatever he took from your father by force, I will return to you as affection. I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster. So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy. 
###ROSALIND
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us. Let me see—what do you think about falling in love? 
###CELIA
Yes, please do, so we can have a good laugh about it. But don’t fall in love for real, and don’t take the game too far. You want to get out of it easily, and with your honor intact. 
###ROSALIND
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead? 
###CELIA
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally. 
###ROSALIND
I wish we could do that, because Fortune gives all of her gifts to the wrong people, and she especially gets things wrong where women are concerned. 
###CELIA
It’s true: the women she makes beautiful she also makes slutty, and the women she makes pure and virginal she also makes ugly. 
###ROSALIND
No, you’re getting Fortune and Nature mixed up: Nature determines how we’re made, and Fortune decides what happens to us. 
## TOUCHSTONE enters.
###CELIA
Oh, really? Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all? And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, and now Fortune is playing a nasty trick on Nature: she’s breaking up a show of wit between two naturally witty women with the arrival of a natural fool. 
###CELIA
Well, maybe this is Nature’s work after all. Maybe Nature sensed that we’re not smart enough to be having this high-flown discussion about goddesses, so she sent us this fool to use as a mental whetstone. After all, smart peoples' wits are always sharpened by the presence of a fool. What’s up, you wit? Where are you wandering off to? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Mistress, you have to go see your father. 
###CELIA
Did they make you the messenger? 
###TOUCHSTONE
No, by my honor, but they told me to come get you. 
###ROSALIND
Where’d you learn a phrase like, “by my honor,” fool? 
###TOUCHSTONE
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad. Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying. 
###CELIA
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave. 
###CELIA
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave. 
###TOUCHSTONE
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave. But you can’t swear by what you don’t have—and this knight had no honor, or if he did, he swore it off before he ever saw those pancakes and that mustard. 
###CELIA
Tell me, who is this knight? 
###TOUCHSTONE
A man old Frederick, your father, loves. 
###CELIA
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me. Enough of this. No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days. 
###TOUCHSTONE
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do. 
###CELIA
Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were silenced, the foolishness of wise men has become all the more apparent. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau. 
## LE BEAU enters.
###ROSALIND
With his mouth full of news. 
###CELIA
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young. 
###ROSALIND
Then we’ll be stuffed with news. 
###CELIA
Well that’s good. If we’re fattened up, we’ll be worth more. Hello, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s the news? 
###LE BEAU
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport. 
###CELIA
Sport? Of what color? 
###LE BEAU
What color, madam? I don’t understand—how should I answer that? 
###ROSALIND
However your wit and luck allow. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Or however the Destinies say you should. 
###CELIA
Nicely done; you laid that on thick. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, if I don’t keep up my rank— 
###ROSALIND
—you’ll lose your smell. 
###LE BEAU
You’re confusing me, ladies. I was going to tell you all about a good wrestling match that’s going on, which you’re missing. 
###ROSALIND
Tell us about this wrestling. 
###LE BEAU
I’ll tell you about the beginning, and if you find that interesting you can see the end. The best is yet to come, and they’re going to perform it right here. 
###CELIA
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried. 
###LE BEAU
There comes an old man with his three sons— 
###CELIA
It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale. 
###LE BEAU
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence— 
###ROSALIND
Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these presents—” 
###LE BEAU
The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler. Immediately, Charles threw the brother, breaking three of his ribs; it’s not likely he will survive. Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third. They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, dear! 
###TOUCHSTONE
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing? 
###LE BEAU
Why, the one I just told you about. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Men must be getting wiser every day; that’s the first time I’ve heard that rib-breaking was appropriate entertainment for ladies. 
###CELIA
Me too, I swear. 
###ROSALIND
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs? Does anyone else love rib breaking? Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin? 
###LE BEAU
You’re going to have to, if you stay here. This is the place they’re scheduled to wrestle, and they’re ready to go. 
###CELIA
Yes, I see them coming. Let’s stay and watch. 
##Trumpets play. DUKE FREDERICK, lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and attendants enter.
###DUKE FREDERICK
Come on. Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness. 
###ROSALIND
Is that the man? 
###LE BEAU
That’s him, madam. 
###CELIA
Alas, he is too young. Yet he seems capable. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
What’s up, daughter and niece? Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man. Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen. Talk to him, ladies. See if you can persuade him. 
###CELIA
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Go ahead. I’ll make myself scarce. 
##He steps aside.
###LE BEAU
Mister Challenger, the princess wants to speak to you. 
###ORLANDO
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty. 
###ROSALIND
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler? 
###ORLANDO
No, lovely princess. He is the general challenger. I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth. 
###CELIA
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age. You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength. If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously. We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up. 
###ROSALIND
Please, young sir. We’ll make sure your reputation isn’t hurt; we’ll take it upon ourselves to argue with the duke that the wrestling match should be called off. 
###ORLANDO
I beg you not to think poorly of me—though I suppose anyone who could deny anything to such beautiful women deserves to be scorned. But please, send me good thoughts in this match. If I’m beaten, the shame is all mine, and I wasn’t in anyone’s good graces to begin with. If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead. I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world. In this world, I’m only taking up space. If I leave, maybe someone more worthy will fill it. 
###ROSALIND
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have. 
###CELIA
Mine too, to join hers. 
###ROSALIND
Good luck. I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances. 
###CELIA
I hope you get what you desire! 
###CHARLES
Come on, where’s the young show-off who’s so eager to lie with mother earth? 
###ORLANDO
Ready, sir, but I have more modest ambitions. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You get only one round. 
###CHARLES
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first. 
###ORLANDO
You should mock me after you’ve beaten me, not before. Come on. 
###ROSALIND
Hercules give you speed, young man! 
###CELIA
I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg. 
##They wrestle.
###ROSALIND
Oh, what an excellent young man! 
###CELIA
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground. 
## ORLANDO throws Charles. The crowd shouts.
###DUKE FREDERICK
No more, no more. 
###ORLANDO
Oh, come on, your Grace—I’m barely out of breath. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
How are you doing, Charles? 
###LE BEAU
He can’t speak, my lord. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Carry him away. What is your name, young man? 
###ORLANDO
Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
I wish you were someone else’s son. The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy. Your victory would have pleased me more if you’d been someone else’s son. But good luck; you are a brave young man. I wish you had told me you had a different father. 
## DUKE FREDERICK, his train, and LE BEAU exit.
###CELIA
If I were my father, cousin, would I do this? 
###ORLANDO
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir. 
###ROSALIND
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion. If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight. 
###CELIA
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him. My my father’s rude and envious behavior is like a knife through my heart. (to ORLANDO) Sir, you fought very well. If you live up to your potential in love as well, your wife will be a very happy woman. 
###ROSALIND
(giving him a chain from her neck) Gentleman, wear this for me. I’m a woman who’s down on her luck, and I’d give more if I could. Shall we go, cousin? 
###CELIA
Yes. Good luck, fair gentleman. 
###ORLANDO
(to himself) Can’t I even say “thank you”? I left my brain back on the wrestling field. What’s left of me is a dummy, just a lifeless block. 
###ROSALIND
He’s calling us back. My pride fell when my fortunes did; I’ll ask him what he wants.—Did you call us, sir? Sir, you wrestled well and conquered more than just your enemies. 
###CELIA
Will you come on, cousin? 
###ROSALIND
I’m coming. Farewell. 
## ROSALIND and CELIA exit.
###ORLANDO
What is this passion that ties up my tongue? I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to. Oh, poor Orlando, you’ve been overthrown! Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you. 
## LE BEAU enters.
###LE BEAU
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place. Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done. The duke is temperamental. I’m sure you can imagine what I mean without my having to spell it out. 
###ORLANDO
Thank you, sir. Now please tell me this: which of the two ladies who were at the wrestling match is the duke’s daughter? 
###LE BEAU
Neither one is his daughter, to judge from their good manners. But really, the smaller one is his daughter. The other is the daughter of the banished duke. Duke Frederick keeps her for his daughter’s sake; the love between the two of them is stronger than the bond between sisters. But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake. I swear, one day the duke’s malice toward Rosalind will suddenly erupt. Goodbye, sir. Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you. 
###ORLANDO
I’m indebted to you. Goodbye. 
## LE BEAU exits.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother! But, oh, heavenly Rosalind! 
##He exits.
## CELIA and ROSALIND enter.
###CELIA
What’s going on, Rosalind? Cupid have mercy! You won’t utter a single word? 
###ROSALIND
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog. 
###CELIA
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs. Throw some of your words at me. Come on, throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog. 
###ROSALIND
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any. 
###CELIA
Is all of this about your father? 
###ROSALIND
No, some of it is about my child’s father. Oh, this working-day world is full of thorns! 
###CELIA
They’re only burrs, cousin, thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior. If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats. 
###ROSALIND
Those burrs I could shake off my clothing, but these are in my heart. 
###CELIA
Cough them up. 
###ROSALIND
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him. 
###CELIA
Come on, take control of your feelings. 
###ROSALIND
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself. 
###CELIA
Oh, that’s a good wish! You’ll fight with him eventually, and fall. But let’s put these jokes aside for a moment, and speak earnestly. Is it possible that you could have fallen in love with Orlando, Sir Rowland’s youngest son, this suddenly? 
###ROSALIND
The duke, my father, loved his father very much. 
###CELIA
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son? By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father. But I don’t hate Orlando. 
###ROSALIND
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake. 
###CELIA
Why shouldn’t I? Doesn’t he deserve it? 
###ROSALIND
Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do. Look, here comes the duke. 
## DUKE FREDERICK enters, with lords
###CELIA
He looks angry. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court. 
###ROSALIND
Me, uncle? 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You, niece. In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it. 
###ROSALIND
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed. If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
All traitors protest like this. If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself. I don’t trust you. Enough said. 
###ROSALIND
But your mistrust alone can’t make me a traitor—on what basis do you suspect me? 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You are your father’s daughter. That’s enough. 
###ROSALIND
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom. I was his daughter when you banished him. Treason is not inherited, my lord. But even if we did inherit it from our family, what does that have to do with me? My father wasn’t a traitor. So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name. 
###CELIA
Dear master, listen to me. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake. Otherwise, she would have been banished with her father. 
###CELIA
At that time, I didn’t beg you to keep her here; you wanted her here, and you felt guilty. I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her. If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I. We have always slept together, woken up together, learned, played, and eaten together. Wherever we went, we went together and inseparable. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
She’s too devious for you. Her smoothness, her silence, and her patient suffering appeal to the people, and they pity her. You’re a fool. She’s robbing you of the attention you deserve. You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture. So be quiet. The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable. She is banished. 
###CELIA
Then lay that sentence on me too, my lord. I cannot live without her. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave. On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die. 
##Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and lords
###CELIA
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go? Do you want to exchange fathers? I’ll give you mine. I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am. 
###ROSALIND
I have more reason to be distressed. 
###CELIA
No you haven’t, cousin. Please, be cheerful. Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter? 
###ROSALIND
No, he hasn’t. 
###CELIA
Oh, he hasn’t? Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one. Will we be separated? Should we part, sweet girl? No. Let my father find another heir. So, help me plan how we’ll escape, where we’ll go, and what we’ll take with us. Don’t even try to take this all upon yourself, bearing your grief alone and leaving me out. I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say. 
###ROSALIND
But where will we go? 
###CELIA
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father. 
###ROSALIND
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far! Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money. 
###CELIA
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt. You do the same, and we’ll be able to travel without attracting any attackers' attention. 
###ROSALIND
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man? I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart. We’ll maintain a swaggering, warrior look, like so many cowardly men, whose manner has nothing to do with what they’re feeling. 
###CELIA
What should I call you when you’re a man? 
###ROSALIND
I’ll take no lesser name than that of Jove’s own servant. So call me Ganymede. And what will you be called? 
###CELIA
Something that refers to my current state. Instead of Celia, call me Aliena. 
###ROSALIND
Cousin, what if we brought that clownish fool of your father’s court, Touchstone? Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels? 
###CELIA
He’d walk the whole wide world with me. Leave me alone to go convince him. Let’s go gather our jewels and money. We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone. Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment. 
##They exit.
## DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS enter, dressed like foresters.
###DUKE SENIOR
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance? Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues? Out here we feel the changing of the seasons, but we’re not bothered by it. When the icy fangs of the brutal, scolding wind bite and blow on my body, even though I’m shivering with cold, I can appreciate the weather’s honesty. I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous toad that wears a precious jewel in its forehead. In this life, far away from the civilized world, we can hear the language of the trees, read the books of the running streams, hear sermons in the stones, and discover the good in every single thing. 
###AMIENS
I wouldn’t change my situation for anything. You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner? It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows. 
###FIRST LORD
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths. He swears that when you kill the deer, you’re a worse usurper than your brother was for banishing you. Today, Lord Amiens and I followed Jaques. We saw him lie down along a brook under an oak tree whose ancient roots peeked out from the earth. A poor, lonely stag who had been hurt by a hunter’s arrow came to rest there, where he heaved such heavy groans that the effort seemed to stretch his hide to bursting. Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose. The hairy fool, watched closely by sad Jaques, stood on the very edge of the brook, adding his own tears to the streaming water. 
###DUKE SENIOR
And what did Jaques say? Didn’t he take the opportunity to draw a moral from the scene? 
###FIRST LORD
Oh, yes, he created a thousand comparisons. First, he spoke of the deer’s needless addition to the stream’s water supply. “Poor deer,” he said, “you’re just like a human: you add more to what already has too much.” Then, about the deer’s being alone, abandoned by his velvety companions: “It’s appropriate,” he said, “that a miserable creature should excuse itself from company.” Just then, a carefree herd of deer, having just eaten their fill of pasture grass, bounded along without stopping to greet their wounded brother. “Sure,” said Jaques, “hurry on, you fat and greasy citizens. Why stop and notice this poor, broken, bankrupt creature here?” In this way, he most insightfully pierced to the heart of the country, the city, the court, and even our lives out here in the forest, swearing that we are mere usurpers and tyrants, frightening and killing animals in their own homes. 
###DUKE SENIOR
And did you leave him like this? 
###SECOND LORD
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Take me to him. I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say. 
###FIRST LORD
I’ll bring you to him right away. 
##They all exit.
## DUKE FREDERICK enters, with LORDS 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave? It cannot be. Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen. 
###FIRST LORD
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave. Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty. 
###SECOND LORD
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing. Hisperia, the princess’s gentlewoman, confesses that she overheard your daughter and her cousin praising the good looks and skills of the wrestler who recently beat the muscular Charles. Hisperia believes that, wherever they have gone, that young man is likely with them. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Send a message to his brother. Bring that swinger Orlando here. If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me. I’ll make Oliver find him. Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways. 
##They all exit.
## ORLANDO and ADAM enter from opposite sides of the stage.
###ORLANDO
Who’s there? 
###ADAM
My young master! Oh, my gentle master! My sweet master! Oh, you living memory of old Sir Rowland! What are you doing here? Why are you so strong and good? Why do people love you? And why are you noble, strong, and brave? Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion? Your praise has beaten you home. Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in? Yours are like that—complete and utter traitors to you. Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him! 
###ORLANDO
Why, what’s the matter? 
###ADAM
Oh, unlucky boy! Don’t walk through these doors. In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you. Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it. And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you. I overheard him and his plans. This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse. Hate it, fear it, do not come inside. 
###ORLANDO
Then where would you have me go, Adam? 
###ADAM
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here. 
###ORLANDO
What, would you have me beg for my food? Or become a lowlife, sticking up travelers on the road? This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it. I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers. 
###ADAM
But don’t do that. I have five-hundred gold coins, which I carefully saved when I was working for your late father. I meant to use it for my retirement, to help me when my old body was lame and forgotten in some dark corner. But take the money, and God, who feeds even the raven and looks after even the sparrow, will comfort me in my old age. Here is the gold, I give it all to you. Let me be your servant. I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly. Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly. Let me go with you. I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you. 
###ORLANDO
Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money. Your approach isn’t the fashion these days, when no one works hard except for a promotion, and, as soon as they’ve got it, they stop working. But in working for me, old man, you are pruning a rotten tree: despite all your pains and efforts, it won’t yield a single blossom. Come along, though. We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living. 
###ADAM
Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath. From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more. Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late. But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything. 
##They exit.
## ROSALIND (dressed as Ganymede), CELIA (dressed as Aliena), and TOUCHSTONE enter.
###ROSALIND
Oh Lord, my spirits are tired! 
###TOUCHSTONE
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired. 
###ROSALIND
I’d insult my manly wardrobe by weeping like a woman if I didn’t have to comfort the weaker vessel here, as the jacket and hose ought to be brave for the sake of the petticoat. So, have courage, good Aliena. 
###CELIA
Please bear with me. I can’t go any further. 
###TOUCHSTONE
I’d rather bear with you than bear you. But if I did carry you, it would be no cross to bear, because I’m pretty sure you don’t have any money. 
###ROSALIND
Well, this is the Forest of Arden. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool. When I was at home, I was in a better place. But travelers have to be content. 
###ROSALIND
Yes, be content, good Touchstone. 
## CORIN and SILVIUS enter.
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk. 
###CORIN
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually. 
###SILVIUS
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her! 
###CORIN
I’m sure I can guess. I have been in love too, you know. 
###SILVIUS
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long. If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to? 
###CORIN
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten. 
###SILVIUS
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me. If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved. Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved. Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved. O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe! 
##He exits.
###ROSALIND
Oh, poor shepherd! Listening to you speak of your wounded heart reminds me of my own pain. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Me too. I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile. I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked. I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things. But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love. 
###ROSALIND
You speak more wisely than you know. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it. 
###ROSALIND
By God! This shepherd’s condition is like my own. 
###TOUCHSTONE
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it. 
###CELIA
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him. I’m faint with hunger. 
###TOUCHSTONE
(to CORIN) Hey, clown! 
###ROSALIND
Shut up, fool. He’s not your relative. 
###CORIN
Who’s calling? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Your superiors. 
###CORIN
If they weren’t my betters, they’d be pretty wretched indeed. 
###ROSALIND
(to TOUCHSTONE) Stop it, I say.—Good evening to you, friend. 
###CORIN
Good evening to you, too, noble sir, and to all of you. 
###ROSALIND
Please sir, if love or money can buy anything in this empty place, tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves. We’ll pay you for the information. We have a young woman here who is very tired from traveling and faint with hunger. 
###CORIN
Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her. But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend. My master is a brutish man and doesn’t care much if he gets to heaven by deeds of hospitality or not. Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house. But let’s see what’s on hand. If I have anything to say about it, you will be most welcome there. 
###ROSALIND
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture? 
###CORIN
That young man who was just here. But he doesn’t really care about buying anything. 
###ROSALIND
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it. 
###CELIA
And we will raise your wages. I like this place. I could see myself wasting time here. 
###CORIN
The thing is definitely going to be sold. Come with me. If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away. 
##They all exit.
## AMIENS, JAQUES, and others enter.
###AMIENS
(singing) Whoever wants to lie with me, Under the greenwood tree, And turn his merry song To follow the sweet bird’s singing, Come here, come here, come here. Here you will find No enemy Besides winter and rough weather. 
###JAQUES
More, more, please, more. 
###AMIENS
It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques. 
###JAQUES
I’m glad about that. More, please, more. I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs. More, please, more. 
###AMIENS
My voice is ragged. I know I won’t please you. 
###JAQUES
I don’t want you to please me, I want you to sing. Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”? 
###AMIENS
Call them whatever you want, Monsieur Jaques. 
###JAQUES
Nah, I don’t care what their names are; they owe me nothing. Will you sing? 
###AMIENS
Okay, but only because you want me to. 
###JAQUES
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now. But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together. Whenever a man compliments me, I feel like he’s a beggar and I just gave him a penny—an embarrassing exchange. Come on, sing—and those of you who won’t sing, shut up. 
###AMIENS
Well, I’ll finish the song I started.—Meanwhile, sirs, set the table. The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know. 
###JAQUES
And I’ve been avoiding him all day. He’s too argumentative for me. I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it. Come, warble for me. 
###EVERYONE
(singing) Whoever shuns ambition And loves to live in the sun, Hunting the food he eats Pleased with what he finds, Come here, come here, come here. Here he will findNo enemy But winter and rough weather. 
###JAQUES
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative. I’ll give it you. 
###AMIENS
And I’ll sing it. (taking a paper fromJAQUES) It goes like this: (sings) If it should come to pass That any man turns into an ass And leaves his wealth and ease Simply to please his stubborn will Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame. Here he will see Fools as stupid as he If he will only come to me. 
###AMIENS
What’s that word “ducdame”? 
###JAQUES
It’s a Greek invocation, calling fools into a circle. I’m going to take a nap, if I can—if I can’t, I’ll curse all the first-born children of Egypt. 
###AMIENS
And I’ll go find the duke; his banquet is ready. 
##They all exit in separate directions.
## ORLANDO and ADAM enter.
###ADAM
Dear master, I can’t go any farther. Oh, I’m dying of hunger. I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master. 
###ORLANDO
Hey, what’s this, Adam? No braver than this? Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little. If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you. You’re not as close to death as you think you are. For my sake, make yourself comfortable; keep death at arm’s length for a while. I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die. But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts. There we go! You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly. But you’re lying out in the cold. Come, I’ll carry you to shelter. And you won’t die for lack of dinner, if there’s anything at all to eat in this desert-like forest. Cheer up, good Adam. 
##They exit.
## DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS enter, dressed like outlaws.
###DUKE SENIOR
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man. 
###FIRST LORD
My lord, he just left here. He was happy here, listening to a song. 
###DUKE SENIOR
If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe. Go find him. Tell him I want to speak with him. 
## JAQUES enters.
###FIRST LORD
He saved me the trouble: here he comes. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Well, what’s going on, mister? What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company? What, you look amused. 
###JAQUES
A fool, a fool! I met a fool in the forest, wearing motley. What a miserable world! As sure as I eat to stay alive, I met a fool who was lying in the sun and complaining about his fortune. He spoke smartly, though he was a fool. “Good morning, fool,” I said. “No, sir,” he said, “don’t call me a fool until heaven has sent me my fortune.” 
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock. This way, we can see how the world moves. Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven. And so, from hour to hour we ripen, and from hour to hour we rot. And there’s a story behind that.” When I heard that motley fool moralizing on the subject of time, I began to crow like a rooster. Hearing a fool speaking so contemplatively made me laugh non-stop for an hour. Oh, noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley is the only thing to wear. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Who is this fool? 
###JAQUES
A worthy fool! He’s been a courtier and says, “If ladies are young and pretty, they always know it.” His brain is dry as a sailor’s biscuit and crammed with all sorts of strange observations, which he presents in mangled fashion. Oh, I wish I were a fool! I’m ambitious for one of those motley coats. 
###DUKE SENIOR
You shall have one. 
###JAQUES
That’s all I ask from you, as long as you promise to rid yourself of any rotten idea that I am wise. Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do. And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest. Why, sir, must he? Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church. Any person who thinks I’m satirizing them would be stupid if they didn’t pretend not to be hurt by my joke. Otherwise, they’d be admitting I was talking about them, and the fool would expose the wise man’s foolishness with a joke that wasn’t even meant for him. Dress me up in motley. Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine. 
###DUKE SENIOR
To hell with you! I know what you’d do. 
###JAQUES
What would I do besides good? 
###DUKE SENIOR
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large. 
###JAQUES
But if I cry out against pride in general, how can anyone say I’m accusing a particular person? Aren’t we talking about a problem as vast as the sea, that keeps flowing until all the wealth in the world is almost used up by everyone showing off? 
What woman in the city am I talking about when I say that the clothes on a city-woman’s unworthy back are rich enough to suit a prince? Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her? And when some lowlife protests that his fancy clothes aren’t my problem, isn’t he basically admitting that I’m talking about him? Well, then. Tell me how I’ve wronged him. If I was right about him, he’s the one who’s done wrong. If he isn’t guilty of the faults I’m talking about, well then, my accusations fly by like wild geese, whom no one owns, since they don’t apply to any man. But who is this? 
## ORLANDO enters with his sword drawn.
###ORLANDO
Stop, and eat no more. 
###JAQUES
But I haven’t eaten anything yet. 
###ORLANDO
And you won’t until the needy eat. 
###JAQUES
What kind of fighting cock is this? 
###DUKE SENIOR
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners? Why do you seem so lacking in civility? 
###ORLANDO
You were right the first time. My piercing distress has stripped me of smooth manners. But I wasn’t raised in the forest, and I was somewhat well-bred. But stop, I say. Whoever eats this fruit before I’ve been taken care of dies. 
###JAQUES
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die. 
###DUKE SENIOR
What would you like? Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does. 
###ORLANDO
I’m dying for food, so let me have some. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table. 
###ORLANDO
Do you really speak like such a gentleman? I beg your pardon. I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding. But whoever you are—you who sit in the dark shade, losing track of time in this remote forest—if you have ever seen better days or been to church or sat at a man’s table for a feast or wiped a tear from your eye, if you know what it is to pity and be pitied, let my kindness and nobility persuade you. With that hope, I’ll blush at my rudeness and put away my sword. 
###DUKE SENIOR
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs. 
###ORLANDO
Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food. There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles. He’s burdened by two debilitating evils—age and hunger. Until he’s fed, I won’t eat a thing. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Go find him. We won’t touch a thing till you return. 
###ORLANDO
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality. 
##He exits.
###DUKE SENIOR
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness. This wide, universal theater has more sad plays than our own little scene. 
###JAQUES
The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors. They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts. In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms. Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. Then he becomes a lover, huffing and puffing like a furnace as he writes sad poems about his mistress’s eyebrows. In the fourth act, he’s a soldier, full of foreign curses, with a beard like a panther, eager to defend his honor and quick to fight. 
On the battlefield, he puts himself in front of the cannon’s mouth, risking his life to seek fame that is as fleeting as a soap bubble. In the fifth act, he is a judge, with a nice fat belly from all the bribes he’s taken. His eyes are stern, and he’s given his beard a respectable cut. He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part. In the sixth act, the curtain rises on a skinny old man in slippers, glasses on his nose and a money bag at his side. The stockings he wore in his youth hang loosely on his shriveled legs now, and his bellowing voice has shrunk back down to a childish squeak. In the last scene of our play—the end of this strange, eventful history—our hero, full of forgetfulness, enters his second childhood: without teeth, without eyes, without taste, without everything. 
## ORLANDO enters carrying ADAM.
###DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Set the honorable old man down and let him eat. 
###ORLANDO
I thank you very much on his behalf. 
###ADAM
You had better do that. I can barely speak to thank you myself. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Eat. I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing. 
###AMIENS
(singing) Blow, blow, winter wind. You aren’t as harsh As men’s ingratitude.Your teeth aren’t as sharp, As you are invisible, Even though your breath is an assault. Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! Sing to the green holly. Most friendship is false, most love simply foolishness. Then heigh-ho, to the holly. This life is really jolly. Freeze, freeze, you bitter sky, Your bite isn’t as painful As when good deeds are forgotten. Even though you can freeze water Your sting is not as sharp As the friend who is forgotten. Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! Sing to the green holly. Most friendship is false, most love simply foolishness. Then heigh-ho, to the holly. This life is really jolly. 
###DUKE SENIOR
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here. I am the duke who loved your father. Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is. Give him your arm. Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me. 
##They all exit.
## DUKE FREDERICK enters, with lords and OLIVER.
###DUKE FREDERICK
You haven’t seen him since? Sir, sir, that can’t be true. If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place. But do this: find your brother, wherever he is. Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land. I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt. 
###OLIVER
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands. Do this immediately, and send him packing. 
##They all exit.
## ORLANDO enters, holding a piece of paper.
###ORLANDO
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love. And you, goddess of the moon, queen of the night—with your chaste eye, from your pale home up above—watch your huntress, who has the power to control my life. Oh, Rosalind, these trees will be my books—I’ll write my thoughts down on their bark. That way, everyone who passes through this forest will find your virtues everywhere. Run, run, Orlando, on every tree carve praises of her beauty, her virtue, and her inexpressibility. 
##He exits.
## CORIN and TOUCHSTONE enter.
###CORIN
And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless. In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible. Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring. Being a simple life, it suits me very well, but being a life without plenty, it doesn’t suit me at all. Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd? 
###CORIN
Only in that I know that the sicker one gets, the worse one feels, and that the man who lacks money, employment, and happiness is without three good friends. I know that rain makes things wet and fire burns things. I know that a good pasture makes sheep fat, that the main cause of night is the absence of sun, and that the man who isn’t smart by nature and hasn’t learned anything from his schooling will complain of his lack of good manners, or he comes from very dull parents indeed. 
###TOUCHSTONE
You’re a natural-born philosopher! Were you ever at court, shepherd? 
###CORIN
Honestly, no. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Then you are damned. 
###CORIN
I hope not. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Yep, you’re damned like a roasted egg: all on one side. 
###CORIN
I’m damned for not having been at court? Explain. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation. You are in a perilous state, shepherd. 
###CORIN
Not at all, Touchstone. The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court. You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands. Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Give a quick example. Come, explain. 
###CORIN
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy. 
###TOUCHSTONE
What, don’t courtiers' hands sweat? And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat? That’s a poor example. A better example—come on. 
###CORIN
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Then your lips will feel them more quickly. Shallow thinking, yet again. Come on. 
###CORIN
Our hands are often covered in tar, from performing surgery on our sheep.Would you have us country folks kiss each other’s tarred hands? Courtiers' hands are perfumed. 
###TOUCHSTONE
You shallow thinker! You worthless man! You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak. Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar. Fix your example, shepherd. 
###CORIN
Your wit is too courtly for me. I’ll rest now. 
###TOUCHSTONE
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned? God help you, foolish man. Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed. 
###CORIN
Sir, I’m a true, simple laborer: I earn what I eat, get what I wear, hate no man, envy no man’s happiness, am happy for other men’s good fortune and satisfied with my own bad fortune, and the source of my greatest pride is watching my ewes graze and my lambs feed. 
###TOUCHSTONE
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation. You act as a pimp to a young ewe by forcing her to have sex with a crooked-headed, horny old ram—a totally unreasonable match. If you’re not damned for that, then the devil must be keeping shepherds out of hell; I can’t see how else you can hope to escape. 
###CORIN
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother. 
## ROSALIND enters, reading from a sheet of paper.
###ROSALIND
(reading, as Ganymede) From the far east to the west Indies There is no jewel like Rosalind. Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind. All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind. Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind. 
###TOUCHSTONE
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours. That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, stop, fool. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do. A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too. Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind. After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart. The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut. The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind. This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along. Why bother with them? 
###ROSALIND
Quiet, you stupid fool. I found them on a tree. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit. 
###ROSALIND
I’ll graft you onto that tree, and when I do I’ll be grafting onto it a medlar. The fruit the tree bears will be the earliest to ripen in the country because, God knows, you’ll be rotten before you’re half-ripe, which is how medlars are. 
###TOUCHSTONE
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely. 
## CELIA enters with a piece of paper.
###ROSALIND
Quiet! Here comes my cousin, reading something; step aside. 
###CELIA
(reading, as Aliena) Why should this place be a desert Just because there are no people in it? No, I’ll hang these poems on every tree, And they will voice the thoughts of a city. Some will be about how man’s brief life is spent in wandering, his entire life contained in the width of an open hand. Some poems will be about betrayals Committed by friends. But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman. Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain. Nature took Helen’s beautiful face, but not her fickle heart; Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty. 
So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all. Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, Lord—what tedious sayings about love have you been wearing out your congregation with? Shouldn’t you have warned, “Be patient, good people”? 
###CELIA
What are you saying?—Shoo, Shepherd, go a little ways away.—Go with him, Touchstone. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Come on, shepherd, let’s make an honorable retreat, though not with all the trappings of a full army; just with a shepherd’s pouch and the stuff he puts in it. 
## CORIN and TOUCHSTONE exit.
###CELIA
Were you listening to these verses? 
###ROSALIND
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too. Some of those lines had more feet than the verses could bear. 
###CELIA
That’s not a problem: the feet can bear the verses. 
###ROSALIND
Sure, but these feet were lame, and couldn’t have stood up without the support of the verses. They stood lamely in the verse. 
###CELIA
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees? 
###ROSALIND
I was working through my wonder when you arrived. Look at what I found on a palm tree. I haven’t been rhymed about like this since my past life, when I was an Irish rat, but I can hardly remember that. 
###CELIA
Do you know who wrote these? 
###ROSALIND
Was it a man? 
###CELIA
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck. Are you blushing? 
###ROSALIND
Please, who? 
###CELIA
Oh God, God! It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes. 
###ROSALIND
No, who are you talking about? 
###CELIA
Is it possible? 
###ROSALIND
No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is. 
###CELIA
Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful! And another wonderful, and beyond-my-ability-to-express wonderful! 
###ROSALIND
Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience? Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas. I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast. I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all. I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news. 
###CELIA
So you want to put a man in your belly. 
###ROSALIND
Did God make him? I mean, what sort of man is he? Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ? 
###CELIA
No, he has only a little beard. 
###ROSALIND
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him. I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on. 
###CELIA
It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant. 
###ROSALIND
Damn you for mocking me. Speak seriously and honestly. 
###CELIA
Really, cousin, it’s him. 
###ROSALIND
Orlando? 
###CELIA
Orlando. 
###ROSALIND
Oh no! What am I going to do in my man’s clothing? What did he do when you saw him? What did he say? How did he look? Where did he go? What brings him here? Did he ask about me? Where is he staying? How did he say good-bye? And when will you see him again? Answer me in a word. 
###CELIA
You’d better get me Gargantua’smouth first. The word’s too big for any mouth nowadays. Answering “yes” and “no” to all those questions would be harder than answering a catechism. 
###ROSALIND
But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing? Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling? 
###CELIA
It’s easier to count specks than to answer a lover’s millions of questions. But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention. I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn. 
###ROSALIND
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit. 
###CELIA
Let me talk, good lady. 
###ROSALIND
Go on. 
###CELIA
He lay there, stretched out like a wounded knight. 
###ROSALIND
Though that must have been a pitiful sight, the ground looked beautiful. 
###CELIA
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please. It’s leaping about like a frisky horse. He was dressed like a hunter. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, that’s ominous! He has come to kill my heart. 
###CELIA
I’d like to sing my song solo. You’re making me go off-key. 
###ROSALIND
Don’t you know that I’m a woman? Whatever I think, I have to say. Sweetheart, go on. 
###CELIA
You’ve made me lose the tune. Quiet! Isn’t that him heading this way? 
## ORLANDO and JAQUES enter.
###ROSALIND
That’s him. Let’s slink off, and watch him from a hiding place. 
###JAQUES
Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone. 
###ORLANDO
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company. 
###JAQUES
Goodbye. Let’s meet as little as we can. 
###ORLANDO
I also hope that we can be better strangers. 
###JAQUES
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks. 
###ORLANDO
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly. 
###JAQUES
Your love’s name is Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, that’s it. 
###JAQUES
I don’t like her name. 
###ORLANDO
They weren’t looking to please you when they christened her. 
###JAQUES
How tall is she? 
###ORLANDO
Just as tall as my heart. 
###JAQUES
You’re sure full of smooth answers. Are you friendly with goldsmiths' wives, and memorized your little speeches off of their rings? 
###ORLANDO
No, but I can answer you just like those painted cloths, where I suppose you memorized all your questions. 
###JAQUES
You have a quick wit; I think it must be made out of Atalanta’s heels. Why don’t you sit down with me? The two of us can complain about our mistress—the world—and all our miseries. 
###ORLANDO
I won’t blame anyone in this world but myself, whose faults I’m most familiar with. 
###JAQUES
Your worst fault is being in love. 
###ORLANDO
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue. I’m tired of you. 
###JAQUES
Well, I was looking for a fool when I found you, so I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. 
###ORLANDO
He’s drowned in the brook: look in, and you’ll see him. 
###JAQUES
There I’ll see only myself. 
###ORLANDO
Which is either a fool or a nothing. 
###JAQUES
I’m not going to waste any more time with you. Goodbye, good Mr. Love. 
###ORLANDO
I’m glad to see you go. Adieu, good Mr. Depression. 
## JAQUES exits.
###ROSALIND
(speaking so that only CELIA can hear) I’m going to talk to him like I’m an insolent boy, so I can play a trick on him.—Can you hear me, forester? 
###ORLANDO
Very well. What do you want? 
###ROSALIND
(as Ganymede) Please, what’s the hour? 
###ORLANDO
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead. There’s no clock here in the forest. 
###ROSALIND
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour. 
###ORLANDO
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”? Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate? 
###ROSALIND
No, not at all, sir. Time travels at different speeds for different people. I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for. 
###ORLANDO
Okay, who does it trot for? 
###ROSALIND
Well, it trots for a young woman between the time she gets engaged and the time she marries: the time that’s passed may only be a week, but it always feels like seven years. 
###ORLANDO
Who does time amble for? 
###ROSALIND
For a priest who doesn’t know his Latin or a rich man who is free from the gout. The one sleeps easily because he isn’t up late studying and the other lives merrily because he’s free from pain. The first lacks the burden of intense, exhausting study, and the second is spared the burden of heavy, exhausting poverty. Time ambles for both men. 
###ORLANDO
Who does it gallop for? 
###ROSALIND
For a thief on his way to the gallows. Such a man walks as slowly as possible and, even so, gets there too soon. 
###ORLANDO
Who does it stand still for? 
###ROSALIND
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves. 
###ORLANDO
Where do you live, pretty young man? 
###ROSALIND
With this shepherdess, my sister, on the outskirts of the forest. We live like fringe on the edges of a petticoat. 
###ORLANDO
Were you born here? 
###ROSALIND
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born. 
###ORLANDO
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this. 
###ROSALIND
Many people have told me so. Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city. He knew too much about courtship, because he fell in love back there, and when he came here he constantly lectured against it. Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex. 
###ORLANDO
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of? 
###ROSALIND
There were no primary ones. All of women’s faults are as alike as one half-pence is to another. Each of a woman’s faults seems monstrous until you’re presented with the next one, which is just as bad. 
###ORLANDO
Please, tell me some of them. 
###ROSALIND
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick. There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks. He hangs his odes on the hawthorns and his elegies on the brambles—each of these poems praising to the heavens one “Rosalind.” Now if I could find this man, this dream-catcher, I would give him some good advice, because he is truly love-sick. 
###ORLANDO
Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of. Please, tell me your cure. 
###ROSALIND
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about. He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure. 
###ORLANDO
What did he say the symptoms were? 
###ROSALIND
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway. Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery. But you’re no such man. You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else. 
###ORLANDO
Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love. 
###ROSALIND
Make me believe it? You might as well make the one you love believe it, which she’s more likely to do than admit that she does—that’s one of the ways that women fool their own consciences. But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man. 
###ROSALIND
Are you really as in love as your poems declare? 
###ORLANDO
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her. 
###ROSALIND
Love is merely a form of insanity, and I tell you, lovers deserve the nuthouse just like crazy people do. The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too. But I promise it can be cured with some guidance. 
###ORLANDO
Have you ever cured anyone this way before? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, one, and this is how I did it. He had to imagine that I was the girl he was in love with. I made him woo me every day. When he did, being the changeable boy I am, I’d mope, act effeminate, switch moods, long for him, like him, be proud and standoffish, be dreamy, full of mannerisms, unpredictable, full of tears and then smiles; be passionate about everything, then nothing. Most boys and women act just like this. I’d like him one minute and despise him the next; cry for him, then spit at him—until finally I drove love out and anger in. He abandoned the world, and hid himself away in a monastery. So I cured him, and I’ll cure you just the same, leaving you as clean as a sheep’s heart, without one spot of love in you. 
###ORLANDO
I don’t want to be cured, boy. 
###ROSALIND
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me. 
###ORLANDO
By my faith in love, I will, then. Tell me where you live. 
###ROSALIND
Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live. Will you come? 
###ORLANDO
Wholeheartedly, good young man. 
###ROSALIND
No, you have to call me Rosalind.—Sister, you’re coming? 
##They all exit.
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter, with JAQUES following unseen.
###TOUCHSTONE
Come on, sweet Audrey. I’ll get your goats, Audrey. Well now, what do you think, Audrey? Am I the man for you, Audrey? Do my simple features please you? 
###AUDREY
Your features, God help us! What features? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, I’m out here with you and your goats, in the same way that the witty poet Ovid was abandoned to the barbaric Goths. 
###JAQUES
(to himself) Oh, knowledge put to such bad use is worse than a god cooped up in a hut. 
###TOUCHSTONE
When a man’s jokes fall that flat, it’s as depressing as getting a large bill for a short stay in a little room. Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical. 
###AUDREY
I don’t know what “poetical” means. Is it “chaste in word and action”? Does it mean being truthful? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial. Lovers are fond of poetry and often concoct great lies in their poems. 
###AUDREY
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical? 
###TOUCHSTONE
I do, in fact. Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying. 
###AUDREY
What, you don’t want me to be chaste? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Not really, unless you were ugly. Chastity and beauty together in one woman is like sweetening sugar with honey. 
###JAQUES
(to himself) A sensible fool. 
###AUDREY
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Yes, but wasting chastity on a dirty slut is like putting good meat in a dirty dish. 
###AUDREY
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly. Maybe sluttishness will follow. Be that as it may, I’m going to marry you. To that end, I’ve spoken with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar from the next village, and he’s promised to meet us here and marry us. 
###JAQUES
(to himself) This I’d like to see. 
###AUDREY
Well, God bless this marriage! 
###TOUCHSTONE
Amen. You know, some men, who have fear in their hearts, might falter at this point. After all, these woods aren’t a proper church, and there’s no congregation here but horned animals. But who cares? I’ll be brave. Horns may be hateful, but they’re also necessary. They say, “Many a man doesn’t know the full extent of what he owns.” Exactly: many a man will see no end to the horns his wife furnishes him with. 
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage. He didn’t do anything to get them. Horns? Well, there they are. Only for poor men? No, no. The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s. Is the single man lucky, then? No. Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead. Just as it’s better to be skilled at self-defense than it is to avoid fighting, it’s better to risk a horn by marrying. Here comes Sir Oliver. 
## SIR OLIVER MARTEXT enters.
Sir Oliver Martext, we’re glad to see you. Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel? 
###SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
Is there anyone to give the bride away? 
###TOUCHSTONE
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods. 
###SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal. 
###JAQUES
(coming forward) Go on, proceed—I’ll give her away. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Good evening, Mr. What’shisname. How are you, sir? We’re glad to see you. God bless you for being here. I’m very glad to see you. This is just a trifling matter here, sir. No, no, put your hat back on. 
###JAQUES
Do you want to get married, fool? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check. 
###JAQUES
And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar? Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you. This man here will slap you two together like two pieces of wood panelling. Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage. 
###TOUCHSTONE
(to himself) I’d rather have this guy marry us, because he is not likely to marry us well, and if we’re not married properly, I’ll have a better excuse later to leave my wife. 
###JAQUES
Come with me and let me advise you. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Come, sweet Audrey. We have to be married properly. Otherwise, we’ll be living in sin.—Goodbye, Sir Oliver. We’re not singing, Oh, sweet Oliver Oh, sweet Oliver Don’t leave me behind— but, Go away, wind Go, I say, I’m not going to marry you. 
## JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY exit.
###SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
It doesn’t matter to me. None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession. 
##He exits.
## ROSALIND and CELIA enter.
###ROSALIND
Don’t talk to me. I’m going to cry. 
###CELIA
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man. 
###ROSALIND
But don’t I have good reason to cry? 
###CELIA
As good a reason as any. So go ahead and cry. 
###ROSALIND
I mean, his hair is even red—the same color as that lying Judas. 
###CELIA
No, it’s a shade browner than Judas’s—but his kisses are just like Judas’s. 
###ROSALIND
No, really, his hair is a nice color. 
###CELIA
A very good color, this chestnut. 
###ROSALIND
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest. 
###CELIA
He must have bought a cast-iron pair of Diana’s lips: an elderly nun isn’t anymore devoted in her kissing than he is. His kiss is cold and chaste. 
###ROSALIND
But why would he promise to come visit me this morning and then not come? 
###CELIA
Really, he’s a total liar. 
###ROSALIND
Do you think so? 
###CELIA
Yes. He’s not a pickpocket or a horse thief, but when it comes to truth in love, he’s as hollow as a cup or a nut hollowed out by a worm. 
###ROSALIND
You think his feelings aren’t true? 
###CELIA
Oh, I think they are—when he’s in love. But he’s not in love. 
###ROSALIND
But you heard him swear up and down that he was. 
###CELIA
He “was,” but that doesn’t mean he is anymore. Besides, the promises of a lover are as untrustworthy as a bartender handing you an inflated tab: they both swear to their lies. He’s staying in the forest with your father now. 
###ROSALIND
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him. He asked me who my parents were, and I told him they were as good as he was. He laughed at that and let me go. But why are we talking about my father, when a man like Orlando exists? 
###CELIA
Oh, sure, he’s a brave man! He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely. He’s like a cowardly jouster, who breaks his lance across his opponent’s shield, rather than directly against it. But everything’s brave that a young man does and foolishness leads. 
## CORIN enters.
Who’s coming here? 
###CORIN
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with. 
###CELIA
Yes, what about him? 
###CORIN
If you’d like to see a scene played out between a man growing pale with unrequited love and a woman glowing with scorn and proud disdain, come with me a short distance and you’ll witness it. 
###ROSALIND
(speaking so that only CELIA can hear) Come on, let’s go. The sight of lovers nourishes whoever else is in love. (to CORIN) Bring us to this little show, and I’ll take a part in their play. 
##They all exit.
## SILVIUS and PHOEBE enter.
###SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me. Do not, Phoebe. Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly. The executioner, who’s seen death so much his heart has grown hard, still says, “forgive me” before he drops the axe on the criminal’s neck. Are you going to be crueler than the man who makes his living by killing? 
## ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN enter at the back of the stage, unseen.
###PHOEBE
I don’t want to be your executioner: I’m trying to avoid you so that I won’t hurt you. You tell me my eyes are murderous—that’s a very pretty sentiment, and oh-so-probable, that my frail, soft eyes (which are so cowardly that they close their gates against dust) are tyrants, butchers, and murderers. I’m frowning at you with all my might right now. If my eyes can injure, let them kill you now. Go ahead. Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers. Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused. If you get scratched with a pin, it leaves a scar; even if you lean on a rush, it leaves an impression on your palm. But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark. Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person. 
###SILVIUS
Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make. 
###PHOEBE
Well, until that time, don’t come near me. And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you. 
###ROSALIND
(coming forward, speaking as Ganymede) And why, please tell me? Is your mother a goddess that you would insult a wretched man, and exult over the injury you’ve caused him, all at the same time? You’re not beautiful—really, you’re not so pretty that you could go to bed with the lights on—so why must you act so proud and pitiless? Wait a minute, what’s going on? Why are you looking at me like that? I don’t see anything in you but nature’s usual handiwork.—Oh, for God’s sake, I think she also wants me to fall in love with her. No, proud woman, don’t hope for that. Not even your black eyebrows, your silky black hair, your beady black eyeballs, or your yellowish-white complexion can make me worship you. You foolish shepherd: why are you following her, raining tears and puffing hot air like a foggy south wind? You are a thousand times better than she. It’s fools like you who, marrying badly, fill the world with ugly children. It’s not her mirror but you who insists she’s beautiful. The image of herself that she gets from you is better than her actual features. 
But mistress, know yourself. Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man. I’m telling you, as a friend, that you should sell while the market’s good—you’re not going to have many more buyers. Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer. You’re already ugly, don’t make matters worse by being scornful, too. So take her, shepherd, and God bless you. 
###PHOEBE
Sweet boy, I’d rather hear you scold me for a whole year than this man woo me for a minute. 
###ROSALIND
He’s fallen in love with your sheer ugliness. (To SILVIUS ) And I think she’s falling in love with my anger. If I’m right, as soon as she answers you with frowns, I’ll rebuke her with bitter words. (to PHOEBE ) Why are you looking at me like that? 
###PHOEBE
I don’t wish you any harm. 
###ROSALIND
I’m telling you, don’t fall in love with me. I’m more false than the promises a man makes while drunk. Besides, I don’t like you. If you’d like to know where I live, my house is in the olive grove close by. —Come on, sister. —Shepherd, keep working on her. —Come on, sister. —Shepherdess, give him another chance. And don’t be proud. The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful. —Come on, to our sheep. 
## ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN exit.
###PHOEBE
Dead shepherd, now I understand what you meant when you said, “You’ve never loved until you’ve fallen in love at first sight.” 
###SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe— 
###PHOEBE
What? Did you say something, Silvius? 
###SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me. 
###PHOEBE
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius. 
###SILVIUS
But if you’re really sorry for me, you can cure me. If you’re sorry for the grief I feel in loving you, you can love me back. Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured. 
###PHOEBE
You have my friendship. Isn’t that enough? 
###SILVIUS
I want you. 
###PHOEBE
Well, that’s just greedy. Silvius, I used to hate you. I still don’t love you, but since you’re well-spoken when it comes to love, I’ll keep you around and make use of you. But don’t expect any more than that. 
###SILVIUS
My love for you is so pure and perfect, and I’m in such a bad way, that I’ll be grateful for whatever leftover love you throw my way. Every once in a while, toss me a distracted smile, and I’ll live on that. 
###PHOEBE
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me? 
###SILVIUS
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times. He’s bought the cottage and the grounds that the old peasant used to own. 
###PHOEBE
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him. He’s an irritable boy, though he speaks well. But what do I care about words? And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to. He’s good-looking, but not too good-looking. He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him. He’ll grow up to be a proper man. The best thing about him is his complexion: as fast as he offends me with words, his pretty face heals the wound. He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age. His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright. His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink. There are women out there, Silvius, who would have nearly fallen in love with him after inspecting him as closely as I have. But I don’t love him or hate him—though I suppose I have more reason to hate him than love him. What right did he have to scold me like that? He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me. I’m surprised I didn’t bite back. But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough. I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it. Will you do that for me, Silvius? 
###SILVIUS
With all my heart, Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
I’ll write it right now—the whole thing is pressing on my mind, and on my heart. I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt. Come with me, Silvius. 
##They exit.
## ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES enter.
###JAQUES
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better. 
###ROSALIND
They say you are a melancholy fellow. 
###JAQUES
I am. I like it better than laughing. 
###ROSALIND
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful. They make themselves targets for ridicule even faster than drunks do. 
###JAQUES
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet. 
###ROSALIND
In that case it’s good to be a post. 
###JAQUES
I’m not a scholar’s kind of melancholy, which is all about impressing one’s peers, or a musician’s, which comes from his passion for his art. I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer. My melancholy is not like a lady’s—which is nothing more than an affectation—nor like a lover’s, which combines all of these qualities. My melancholy is purely my own—a compound made from many ingredients. I’m serious because I’ve traveled so much. When I think about all the things I’ve seen, I sink into deep thoughts. 
###ROSALIND
You’re a traveler. Well then, you have good reason to be sad. I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s. To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands. 
###JAQUES
Not true. I gained my experience. 
###ROSALIND
And your experience makes you sad. I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less! 
## ORLANDO enters.
###ORLANDO
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind. 
###JAQUES
No—I’ll say goodbye if you’re going to talk in blank verse. 
###ROSALIND
Goodbye, Mr. Traveler. Make sure to keep up your foreign accent, wear strange clothes, belittle all the benefits you receive from your native land and fall out of love with it, and nearly curse God for making you look like the Englishman you are, or else I’ll never believe you’ve paddled in a gondola in a Venetian canal, as you say you have. 
## JAQUES exits.
(as Ganymede pretending to be ROSALIND ) What’s going on, Orlando? Where have you been all this time? And you call yourself a lover? If you ever insult me like this again, don’t bother coming around here again. 
###ORLANDO
My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late. 
###ROSALIND
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour? A man who will dare to meet his lover even a thousandth part of a minute late—well, it’s possible he likes her, but I doubt he really loves the woman. 
###ORLANDO
Forgive me, darling Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you. I’d rather be wooed by a snail. 
###ORLANDO
A snail? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, a snail. Because even though he’s slow, he carries his house on his head—a better offer than you can make a woman, I think. Besides, he brings his fate with him. 
###ORLANDO
What fate is that? 
###ROSALIND
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives. See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity. 
###ORLANDO
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous. 
###ROSALIND
And I am your Rosalind. 
###CELIA
(as Aliena) He likes calling you that, but he’s got another Rosalind out there with a prettier face. 
###ROSALIND
Come on, woo me, woo me. I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want. What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
I’d kiss you before I spoke. 
###ROSALIND
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say. When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss. 
###ORLANDO
What if she won’t kiss me? 
###ROSALIND
Then she’s making you beg, and that gives you a whole new set of things to talk about. 
###ORLANDO
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves? 
###ROSALIND
Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit. 
###ORLANDO
Would I be out of my suit? 
###ROSALIND
No, you’d still have your clothes on—but, yes, I wouldn’t think much of you. Aren’t I your Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her. 
###ROSALIND
Well, on behalf of Rosalind, I’ll tell you I don’t want you. 
###ORLANDO
Then, on behalf of myself, I’ll tell you I’ll die. 
###ROSALIND
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy. This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love. Troilus may have wanted to die from love, and he’s now considered one of the great, tragic love heroes, but, in fact, a Greek with a club beat his brains out. It had nothing to do with love. Leander would have lived many more years if it hadn’t been for a particularly hot summer night, when he went swimming in the Hellespont, got a cramp, and drowned. The foolish poets of the time insisted he died for love, but they’re lying. All the love stories are lies. Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not because of love. 
###ORLANDO
I hope Rosalind doesn’t feel as you do. Her frown alone would kill me. 
###ROSALIND
No, her frown wouldn’t kill a fly. But come on, now I’ll play your Rosalind, and in a more friendly state of mind. Whatever you ask for, I’ll give. 
###ORLANDO
Then love me, Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest. 
###ORLANDO
And will you have me? 
###ROSALIND
Sure, and twenty others just like you. 
###ORLANDO
What’s that? 
###ROSALIND
Well, aren’t you a good man? 
###ORLANDO
I hope so. 
###ROSALIND
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister? 
###ORLANDO
Please, marry us. 
###CELIA
I can’t say the words. 
###ROSALIND
You just have to say, “Do you, Orlando—” 
###CELIA
Oh, stop it.—Do you, Orlando, take Rosalind to be your lawfully wedded wife? 
###ORLANDO
I do. 
###ROSALIND
Okay, but when? 
###ORLANDO
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows. 
###ROSALIND
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” 
###ORLANDO
I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife. 
###ROSALIND
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband. Look, I’ve sped ahead of the priest and answered the question before he even asked. A woman’s thoughts are always running ahead of her actions. 
###ORLANDO
So do all thoughts. They have wings. 
###ROSALIND
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her. 
###ORLANDO
Forever and a day. 
###ROSALIND
You might as well just say for “a day,” and forget the “ever” part. No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled. Women are as sweet and temperate as springtime when they’re single, but the climate changes once they’re married. I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey. I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood. And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena. 
###ORLANDO
But will my Rosalind do this, too? 
###ROSALIND
Indeed, she’ll act just like me. 
###ORLANDO
But she is wise. 
###ROSALIND
Right. If she weren’t wise, she wouldn’t be smart enough to behave badly. The wiser the woman, the wilder. If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window. If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole. If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke. 
###ORLANDO
A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” 
###ROSALIND
Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed. 
###ORLANDO
And what wit could excuse that? 
###ROSALIND
She’ll say she was at the neighbor’s looking for you. You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue. A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman. And she’s hardly fit to be a mother—her child will turn out to be a fool. 
###ORLANDO
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, no! Darling, I can’t live without you for two hours. 
###ORLANDO
I must join the duke for lunch. I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, go, leave me. I knew you’d turn out this way. My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too. But I was won over by your flattering words. I’m just another girl whom you’ve cast aside. So, take me, death! You’ll be back at two o'clock? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, sweet Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
Honestly, truly, in God’s name, and by all those little girly oaths that don’t actually have any power, if you break even a little bit of your promise, or if you come even a minute after two o'clock, I’ll think you the most pathetic promise breaker, the most lying lover, and the most unworthy partner for Rosalind that could be found anywhere. So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise. 
###ORLANDO
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind. So, goodbye. 
###ROSALIND
Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal. Time will tell what kind of a man you are. Goodbye. 
## ORLANDO exits.
###CELIA
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours. We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly. 
###ROSALIND
Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am. The bottom of my love is so deep it can’t be reached. It’s as deep as the bay of Portugal. 
###CELIA
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other. 
###ROSALIND
Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs. I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando. I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns. 
###CELIA
And I’m going to sleep. 
##They exit.
## JAQUES enters with LORDS, dressed like foresters.
###JAQUES
Which one of you killed the deer? 
###FIRST LORD
It was me, sir. 
###JAQUES
Let’s bring this man to the duke, like a triumphant Roman conqueror. Put the deer’s horns on his head, like a victory branch. Do you have a song, forester, for this occasion? 
###SECOND LORD
Yes, sir. 
###JAQUES
Then sing it. It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough. 
###SECOND LORD
(sings) What should we give to the man who killed this deer? Give him the hide and the horns to wear. Then sing this song to send him home (The other LORDS pick up the deer) Don’t be ashamed to wear the horns. They’ve been worn since before you were born. Your father’s father wore it, And your father endured it. The horn, the horn, the lustful horn Is not to be laughed at or scorned. 
##They all exit.
## ROSALIND and CELIA enter.
###ROSALIND
What do you say now? Isn’t it past two o'clock? And I see a lot of Orlando here. 
###CELIA
I’m telling you, he’s taken his bow and arrows and, with a pure love and a worried brain, has gone to take a nap. 
## SILVIUS enters.
Look who’s coming. 
###SILVIUS
(to ROSALIND) I’ve been sent to find you, young man. My lovely Phoebe told me to give you this letter. I don’t know what’s in it, but guessing from her stern expression and her wasp-like demeanor as she was writing it, I bet she’s angry. You’ll have to excuse me, as I’m just the messenger. 
###ROSALIND
(reading the letter as Ganymede) Patience herself would be shocked by this letter and become feisty. If I can take this, I can take anything. She says I’m not handsome and have no manners. She says I’m arrogant and that she couldn’t love me even if men were as rare as the mythical phoenix. Honestly! I’m not hunting after her love. Why would she write this way to me? Tell the truth, shepherd: you wrote this letter. 
###SILVIUS
No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it. Phoebe wrote it. 
###ROSALIND
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love. I saw her hands: they were as rough as leather and just as brown; I thought she was wearing old gloves, but they were, in fact, her hands. These are the hands of a hard-working housewife, but that’s not the point. The point is that she didn’t write this letter. These are a man’s words, and his handwriting. 
###SILVIUS
I’m telling you, it’s hers. 
###ROSALIND
Well, it’s written in a boisterous and rude style—someone is up for a fight. Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian. No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings. Do you want to hear what she says? 
###SILVIUS
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty. 
###ROSALIND
She’s Phoebe-ing me. Listen to what the tyrant says. (reading) “Are you a god disguised as a shepherd, that you know so expertly how to burn my heart?” Now, honestly, would a woman rant like this? 
###SILVIUS
You call that ranting? 
###ROSALIND
(reading) “Why have you set aside your divine nature just to battle with a woman’s affections?” Did you ever hear such ranting? (reading) “When other men have wooed me, they didn’t hurt me.” In other words, she thinks I’m not a man, but an animal. 
(reading) “If the scorn in your bright eyes can make me fall so deeply in love, can you imagine what power they might have if they looked at me more kindly? While you sneered at me, I loved you. Consider what effect kind prayers might have. The man that brings you this letter doesn’t know how I feel about you. Send me your answer via him. Tell me via him whether you will accept my faithful offer of myself and all that I can do. Or tell him you will deny my love, in which case I’ll figure out how to die.” 
###SILVIUS
You call this sneering? 
###CELIA
(as Aliena) Oh, you poor shepherd! 
###ROSALIND
Why do you pity him? He doesn’t deserve any pity. (to SILVIUS) Why would you love such a woman? So she can turn you into an instrument and play lousy tunes on you? It’s unbearable. Well, go back to her—I can tell she’s turned you into a perfectly tame snake—and tell her this: if she loves me, I command her to love you. And if she won’t love you, tell her I’ll never take her unless you beg me to. If you’re a true lover, get out of here. No, don’t say another word, because here comes more company. 
## SILVIUS exits.
## OLIVER enters.
###OLIVER
Good morning, pretty ones. Tell me, if you know: where in this forest is there a shepherd’s cottage surrounded by olive trees? 
###CELIA
West of here, in the valley next to us. Passing by on your right, there is a row of willows. Follow them straight to the cottage. But right now, the house is keeping to itself— there’s no one home. 
###OLIVER
I think I recognize you from a description I was given of your clothing and age: “The boy is pretty and feminine, and carries himself like a blooming young woman. The woman is short, with a darker complexion than her brother.” Aren’t you the owners of the house I was just asking about? 
###CELIA
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are. 
###OLIVER
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you? 
###ROSALIND
It is. What does this mean? 
###OLIVER
It’s a story that involves some shame on my part. It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained. 
###CELIA
Please, tell us. 
###OLIVER
When young Orlando left you last, he promised to return within an hour. He was pacing through the forest, thinking bittersweet thoughts of love, and listen what happened! He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back. A green and gold snake had wound itself around this man’s neck and was slowly making its way toward the man’s mouth. However, when it saw Orlando, it unwound itself and slunk away into a bush. But there happened to be a lioness crouching under that bush. Her cubs had nursed from her until she was dry, so she was ravenously hungry, and she was lying with her head on the ground, watching the man as cats do and waiting to see if he would wake up—a lion won’t prey on anything that seems dead. Seeing the lioness, Orlando approached the sleeping man. He discovered that the man was his older brother. 
###CELIA
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive. 
###OLIVER
And he was right. I know exactly how inhumane he was. 
###ROSALIND
But, back to Orlando, did he leave his brother there, to be food for the hungry mother-lioness? 
###OLIVER
He turned away twice and almost left him there. But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved. He fought the lioness and quickly defeated her. I woke from my miserable sleep when I heard the noise of their struggle. 
###CELIA
Are you his brother? 
###ROSALIND
Was it you that he rescued? 
###CELIA
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him? 
###OLIVER
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted. 
###ROSALIND
But what about the bloody handkerchief? 
###OLIVER
I’ll get there. When we had told each other our entire stories and cried, and I’d told him how I’d ended up in in the forest—well, he brought me to the duke, who gave me fresh clothing and hospitality, and put me in my brother’s care. My brother immediately took me to his cave, where he took off his clothing and there on his arm was a wound where the lioness had attacked him, ripping off some of his flesh. The wound had been bleeding the entire time. So, now he fainted, and as he fainted, he called out, “Rosalind!” Quickly, I resuscitated him and bound up his wound. After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man— 
he sent me out to find you, even though I’m a stranger to you. He wanted me to tell you this story and beg your forgiveness for his having broken his promise. He wanted me to give this handkerchief, soaked in his blood, to the boy that he jokingly calls his Rosalind. 
## ROSALIND faints.
###CELIA
Oh no! Ganymede! Ganymede, sweetheart? 
###OLIVER
Many people faint when they see blood. 
###CELIA
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede! 
###OLIVER
Look, he’s recovering. 
###ROSALIND
I want to go home. 
###CELIA
We’ll take you there. Please, will you take his arm? 
###OLIVER
Buck up, boy! You’re a man? You don’t have a man’s courage. 
###ROSALIND
It’s true, I confess. Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake. Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on. Whoo-hoo! 
###OLIVER
That was no show. Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint. 
###ROSALIND
Fake, I’m telling you. 
###OLIVER
Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man. 
###ROSALIND
That’s what I’m doing. But honestly, I should have been a woman. 
###CELIA
Come on, you keep getting paler. Please, let’s go home. Sir, please come with us. 
###OLIVER
I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
I’ll think of something. But please, tell him how well I faked a faint. Will you come with us? 
##They all exit.
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter.
###TOUCHSTONE
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey. Be patient. 
###AUDREY
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said. 
###TOUCHSTONE
No, he was wicked and vile. But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl. 
###AUDREY
Yes, I know who you’re talking about, but he has no claim on me. 
## WILLIAM enters. 
Here comes the man himself. 
###TOUCHSTONE
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin. Truly, we witty men can’t hold our tongues. We have to mess with the likes of him, we just can’t help it. 
###WILLIAM
Good evening, Audrey. 
###AUDREY
Good evening, William. 
###WILLIAM
And good evening to you, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Good evening to you, good friend. No, no, put your hat back on, put it back on. No, please, keep your head covered. How old are you, friend? 
###WILLIAM
Twenty-five, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
A mature age. Is your name William? 
###WILLIAM
Yes, it’s William, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
A good name. Were you born here in the forest? 
###WILLIAM
Yes sir, thank God. 
###TOUCHSTONE
“Thank God”—that’s a good answer. Are you rich? 
###WILLIAM
Well, so-so. 
###TOUCHSTONE
“So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer. And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so. Are you wise? 
###WILLIAM
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, that’s a fine answer. I seem to remember a saying: “Only a fool thinks he’s wise; the wise man knows that he is, in fact, a fool.” When one self-described philosopher wanted to eat grapes, he opened his lips when they entered his mouth, thereby making the theoretical point that grapes were made to be eaten, and lips to open. Do you love this girl? 
###WILLIAM
I do, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Give me your hand. Are you educated? 
###WILLIAM
No, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it. Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty. And all the authorities know that ipse is Latin for “he.” You are no longer ipse, because I am he. 
###WILLIAM
Which he, sir? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Why, the he that will marry this woman. Therefore, idiot, abandon (or, in common language, “leave”) the society (which in the boorish tongue is “company”) of this female—maybe you’ll get it if I say “woman,” instead. Say it all at once, now: abandon the society of this female, or, simpleton, you’ll perish. Let me put it in a way you’ll understand: you’ll die. Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity. I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword. I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness. I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways. Therefore, tremble with fear and leave. 
###AUDREY
Do what he says, William. 
###WILLIAM
Farewell, sir. 
##He exits.
## CORIN enters.
###CORIN
Our master and mistress are looking for you. Let’s go. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming. 
##They all exit.
## ORLANDO and OLIVER enter.
###ORLANDO
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her? And fall in love with her after merely seeing her? And as soon as you fall in love, with her, woo her? And as soon as you woo her, have her accept? And do you really mean to marry her? 
###OLIVER
Don’t question the foolish haste of it all—or her poverty or our short time together or the abruptness of my courtship or the abruptness of her consent—but say with me, “I love Aliena.” And say with me that she loves me. Agree to this match, so we can enjoy each other. It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest. 
###ORLANDO
You have my consent. You can be married tomorrow if you want. I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers. Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind. 
## ROSALIND enters.
###ROSALIND
Hello, brother. 
###OLIVER
And hello to you, fair sister. 
##He exits.
###ROSALIND
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling. 
###ORLANDO
Actually, it’s my arm. 
###ROSALIND
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws. 
###ORLANDO
My heart has been wounded, but by a lady, not a lion. 
###ROSALIND
Did your brother tell you how well I pretended to faint when he showed me the handkerchief? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, and he told me some things that were even more amazing. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, I know what you’re talking about. It’s true: it was as sudden as two rams rushing at each other, and as quick as Julius Caesar’s “I came, I saw, I conquered.” Your brother and my sister had no sooner met than they gave each other a good once over; they had no sooner looked at each other than they fell in love; no sooner fell in love than they sighed; no sooner sighed than they asked each other why they had sighed; no sooner answered than they sought a solution. And in this way, degree by degree, they’ve built a staircase toward marriage. And they had better climb those stairs immediately, or else they’ll end up in bed before they ought to. They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together. You couldn’t beat the two of them apart. 
###ORLANDO
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony. But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes. Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for. 
###ROSALIND
Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow? 
###ORLANDO
I can’t live by pretending anymore. 
###ROSALIND
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat. You should know that I think you’re a smart man. I really mean it. I’m not telling you this so you’ll think well of me (who wouldn’t think well of someone who thought well of him, after all?) And I’m not trying to enhance my own reputation, but only to do you good. Believe me, then, that I have special powers. Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here. If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena. I know where she is and, if you don’t mind, I will set her before you tomorrow, whole and unharmed. 
###ORLANDO
Are you serious? 
###ROSALIND
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician. So put on your best clothes and tell your friends to come. Because if you want to be married tomorrow, you will, and if you want to be married to Rosalind, you will. 
## SILVIUS and PHOEBE enter.
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her. 
###PHOEBE
Young man, it was very rude of you to show him the letter I wrote you. 
###ROSALIND
I don’t care. I’m being contemptuous and cruel toward you on purpose. A faithful shepherd worships you. Why don’t you pay attention to him? Why don’t you love him? He adores you. 
###PHOEBE
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love. 
###SILVIUS
It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
And like I am for Ganymede. 
###ORLANDO
And like I am for Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
And like I am for no woman. 
###SILVIUS
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
And like I am for Ganymede. 
###ORLANDO
And like I am for Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
And like I am for no woman. 
###SILVIUS
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion. It means being humble, being patient, being impatient, being pure, being put-upon, being obedient. Just as I am for Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
And I for Ganymede. 
###ORLANDO
And I for Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
And I for no woman. 
###PHOEBE
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you? 
###SILVIUS
And why do you blame me for loving you? 
###ORLANDO
And why do you blame me for loving you? 
###ROSALIND
Who are you talking to? 
###ORLANDO
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me. 
###ROSALIND
All right, stop this. You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon. (to SILVIUS) I’ll help you, if I can. (to PHOEBE) If I could love you, I would. All of you, meet me here tomorrow. (to PHOEBE) If I’m ever going to marry a woman, I’ll marry you. And I am getting married tomorrow. (to ORLANDO) If I will ever satisfy a man, I’ll satisfy you. And you will get married tomorrow. (to SILVIUS) If the thing you desire will make you happy, I’ll make you happy. And you’ll get married tomorrow. (to ORLANDO) By the love you have for Rosalind, come back tomorrow. (to SILVIUS) By the love you have for Phoebe, come here tomorrow.—And by my love for no woman, I’ll also be here tomorrow. So, goodbye for now. You all know what to do. 
###SILVIUS
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here. 
###PHOEBE
Me too. 
###ORLANDO
Me too. 
##They all exit.
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter.
###TOUCHSTONE
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey. We’ll be married tomorrow. 
###AUDREY
I can’t wait. I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman. 
##Two PAGES enter.
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages. 
###FIRST PAGE
Good afternoon, good gentleman. 
###TOUCHSTONE
It really is good to see you. Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song. 
###SECOND PAGE
Sounds good to us. Sit between us. 
###FIRST PAGE
Should we just get down to it? Should we skip all that hacking and spitting and saying that we’re hoarse, which only makes clear what lousy singers we are? 
###SECOND PAGE
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse. 
###PAGES
(singing) There was a lover and his girl, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, Who walked through the cornfield In the springtime, the only proper wedding time, The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. Between the acres of rye, 
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no The pretty country folk would lie In the springtime, the only proper wedding-time, The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. They wrote this song at that time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, About how life was as short-lived as a flower In the springtime, the only proper wedding time, The time when birds sing, hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. So seize the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, For love is all perfection In the springtime, the only proper wedding time, The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune. 
###FIRST PAGE
No, sir, you’re wrong; we kept the song’s time, we didn’t lose any. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Oh, yes you did—I lost time listening to your foolish song. God be with you, and I hope He fixes your voices! Come on, Audrey. 
##They all exit.
## DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA enter.
###DUKE SENIOR
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised? 
###ORLANDO
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t. I’m afraid of hoping, but I hope anyway. 
## ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHOEBE enter.
###ROSALIND
(as Ganymede) Be patient for a bit longer while I go over the terms of our agreement. (to DUKE SENIOR ) You say that if I bring Rosalind here, you will give her to Orlando in marriage? 
###DUKE SENIOR
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her. 
###ROSALIND
(to ORLANDO ) And you promise to marry her, when I bring her here? 
###ORLANDO
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms. 
###ROSALIND
(to PHOEBE ) And you say you’ll marry me, if I’m willing to marry you? 
###PHOEBE
Yes, even if I die an hour later. 
###ROSALIND
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead? 
###PHOEBE
That’s the deal. 
###ROSALIND
(to SILVIUS ) And you agree to marry Phoebe, if she is willing? 
###SILVIUS
Even if marrying her meant I died. 
###ROSALIND
I’ve promised to make everything right. Duke Senior, keep your promise to give away your daughter. Orlando, keep your promise to marry his daughter. Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me. Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me. I’ll leave now, to set all these things right. 
## ROSALIND and CELIA exit.
###DUKE SENIOR
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter. 
###ORLANDO
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother. But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic. His uncle, who the boy says is a great magician and lives concealed within the boundaries of this forest, taught him. 
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter.
Well, look: there must be another flood coming, with these couples also on their way to Noah’s ark. Here comes a pair of those strange creatures called “fools” in any language. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Hello, and greetings to you all. 
###JAQUES
My lord, welcome this man. This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest. He swears he used to be a courtier. 
###TOUCHSTONE
If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial. I have danced a round, I have flattered a lady, I have been polite with my friends, smooth and cunning with my enemies. I have bankrupted three tailors. I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight. 
###JAQUES
And how was that one settled? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause. 
###JAQUES
What do you mean, the seventh cause? (to DUKE SENIOR ) My good lord, I hope you like this fellow. 
###DUKE SENIOR
I like him very well. 
###TOUCHSTONE
God bless you, sir. I want the same thing as all these other people. I’ve come here to be married, like all these other would-be couples. This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine. It’s a strange habit of mine to take the thing that no one else wants: virginity in an ugly girl is like a rich man living in a broken-down house or a pearl in the hideous oyster. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings. 
###TOUCHSTONE
His wittiness, a sweet disease, is here one minute and gone the next, sir, as with most fools. 
###JAQUES
But back to that argument you mentioned. What’s the “seventh cause”? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Our argument went through seven stages—watch your posture, Audrey.—It went like this. I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard. He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine. They call this “the courteous retort.” If I repeat that it isn’t cut well, and he responds that he isn’t trying to please me, just himself, with his beard. They call this “ the modest quip.” If I say again it is poorly cut, and he responds that my judgment is no good, they call this “the sullen reply.” If I say yet again that his beard is poorly cut, and he says that I’m not speaking the truth, they call this “the brave retort.” One more time I say it’s not well cut, and he says I’m lying. They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” 
###JAQUES
And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well? 
###TOUCHSTONE
I didn’t dare take it past “the circumstantial lie,” and he didn’t dare go to the “direct lie,” so we compared the lengths of our swords and then ended the fight. 
###JAQUES
Can you name the steps of that argument again? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Of course, sir. There are rulebooks for arguing just as there are rulebooks for manners. Here are the steps. First is “the courteous retort”; second, “the modest quip”; third, “the sullen reply”; fourth, “the valiant retort”; fifth, “the argumentative countercheck”; sixth, “the circumstantial lie”; seventh, “the direct lie.” You can avoid getting to that final stage if you can properly use an “if.” I once heard of an argument that seven judges couldn’t settle. The two parties met up on their own, and one said, “Well, if you said this-and-that, then I must have said such-and-such,” and they shook hands and parted on good terms. “If” is the only peacemaker. “If” is a very valuable word. 
###JAQUES
Isn’t he a remarkable fellow, my lord? He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester. 
###DUKE SENIOR
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit. 
## HYMENHymen is the mythological god of marriage.HYMEN enters with ROSALIND and CELIA, dressed as themselves. Soft music plays.
###HYMEN
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite. 
Good duke, come receive your daughter. Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here. 
###ROSALIND
(to DUKE SENIOR ) I give myself to you, for I am yours.(to ORLANDO ) I give myself to you, for I am yours. 
###DUKE SENIOR
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter. 
###ORLANDO
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind. 
###PHOEBE
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love. 
###ROSALIND
(to DUKE SENIOR ) If you won’t be my father, I won’t have any. (to ORLANDO ) If you won’t be my husband, I won’t have any. (to PHOEBE ) If you won’t be my wife, I won’t have any. 
###HYMEN
Quiet! Stop chattering until I’ve made everything clear. There are eight people here that I will join in marriage, if the truth you see before you pleases you. (to ORLANDO and ROSALIND ) No hardship can part you. (to OLIVER and CELIA ) Your hearts are together. (to PHOEBE ) You must consent to having Silvius as your husband, unless you’d rather be married to a woman. (to TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY ) You are bound to each other as closely as winter is to bad weather. (to all the married couples) While we sing a wedding hymn, satisfy your curiosity with questioning. Your surprise will fade, and you’ll learn how all this came to be. 
(singing) Marriage is the crown Juno wears, It’s a holy bond of domesticity. It’s marriage that populates each town, So marriage should be honored. Honor, honor, and fame Is due to Hymen, the god of every town. 
###DUKE SENIOR
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter. 
###PHOEBE
(to SILVIUS ) I won’t go back on my promise; I’ll marry you. You’ve won me over with your faith. 
## JAQUES DE BOYS enters.
###JAQUES DE BOYS
Let me have your attention for a moment. I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news. When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother. But just at the edge of the forest, he met an old religious man. He spoke with him for a while and decided not only to abandon his pursuit of his brother but even to retreat from the world. He’s giving the throne to his banished brother and restoring all the men he’d exiled to their rightful lands. I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Welcome, young man: you bring a great present to your brothers' wedding. To Oliver, you return his lands; to Orlando, you give a whole dukedom, since he will inherit my land. But first, let’s finish the things we started out here. Then I’ll share the abundance of my returned fortune with all those that have stayed out here with me, according to the rank and status each of you enjoy. But until then, let’s forget our nobility and enjoy some fun. Music, please. Brides and bridegrooms, dance your happiness away. 
###JAQUES
Wait a minute, sir. Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk? 
###JAQUES DE BOYS
Yes, he has. 
###JAQUES
I will go find him. There is much to be learned from these converts. (to DUKE SENIOR ) I bestow on you your former honor, for your patience and virtue. (to ORLANDO ) I give you the love that your faithfulness deserves (to OLIVER ) and you your land, your love, and your great allies. (to SILVIUS ) You get a long and well-deserved stay in bed, with your new wife. 
(to TOUCHSTONE) And you I expect to be up fighting soon. The honeymoon will last two months, tops.— And with that, you may all return to your dancing. I’m bound for another fate. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit. 
###JAQUES
No, this fun is not for me. I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me. 
##He exits.
###DUKE SENIOR
Let’s proceed. We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight. 
##Everyone dances.
##Everyone exits except ROSALIND.
###ROSALIND
You don’t usually see a woman deliver an epilogue, but it’s no worse than seeing a man deliver the prologue. If it’s true that you don’t need ivy to sell good wine, then it should also be true that a good play doesn’t need an epilogue. But they use good-quality ivy to sell good wine, and a good play is improved by a good epilogue. But then I’m in a strange position, as I not only do not have a good epilogue, I’m not sure this was a good play. I’m not dressed like a beggar, so it wouldn’t be becoming for me to beg. No, instead I’ll bewitch you, and I’ll start with the women. Women, in the name of the love you have for men, I demand that you like as much of this play as you feel like. Men, in the name of the women you love—and I can guess by your goofy smiles that none of you exactly hates them—the play will act as a nice toy for you and the ladies to share. If I actually were a woman, I’d kiss all of you that have beards that pleased me, complexions that I liked, and breath that wasn’t foul. And I’m sure that all of you with nice beards, good faces, and sweet breath will, when I curtsy good night, give me a nice round of applause. 
##She exits.

## ORLANDO and ADAM enter.
###ORLANDO
I remember, Adam, that’s exactly why my father only left me a thousand crowns in his will. And as you know, my father commanded my brother, Oliver, to make sure that I was brought up well—and that’s where my sadness begins. Oliver keeps my brother Jaques away at school, and everyone says he’s doing extremely well there. But he keeps me at home in the country—to be precise, he keeps me stuck at home but doesn’t support me. I ask you, is this any way to treat a gentleman as nobly born as I am, to pen me in like an ox? His horses get treated better than I do—at least he feeds them and trains them properly, and spends a lot of money on trainers for them. All I’ve gained from his care is weight, which makes me as indebted to him as his animals on the manure pile are. He gives me plenty of nothing, and takes away everything else, letting me eat with his servants, refusing me what’s owed me as his brother, and ruining my good birth with a poor education. This is what angers me, Adam. My father’s temper and spirit, which I think I share, makes me want to mutiny against my brother’s tyranny. I won’t stand for it any longer, though I haven’t yet figured out how to revolt. 
## OLIVER enters.
###ADAM
Here comes my master, your brother. 
###ORLANDO
Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me. 
###OLIVER
Hey, you! What are you making here? 
###ORLANDO
Nothing. I’ve never been taught how to make anything. 
###OLIVER
Well, then, what are you messing up? 
###ORLANDO
I’m helping you mess up one of God’s creations—your poor, unworthy brother—by having him do nothing. 
###OLIVER
Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while. 
###ORLANDO
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them? When did I waste so much money that I ended up this poor? 
###OLIVER
Do you know where you are, sir? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard. 
###OLIVER
Do you know whom you’re talking to? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, better than you know me. I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect. But we’re in the same family, so you should acknowledge that I am a gentleman too. According to custom, as the first-born you are my superior. But it’s not customary to treat me like I’m not even a gentleman, even if there were twenty brothers between you and me. I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older. 
###OLIVER
(hitting ORLANDO) What nerve! 
###ORLANDO
(grabbing hold of OLIVER) Come on, big brother; you don’t know anything about fighting. 
###OLIVER
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain? 
###ORLANDO
I’m no villain. I’m the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, and anyone who claims my father’s sons are villains is a villain himself. If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this. You’ve only insulted yourself. 
###ADAM
Gentlemen, calm down. For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace. 
###OLIVER
Let me go, I say. 
###ORLANDO
I won’t until I’m ready. You will listen to me. My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education. But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman. My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer. Either give me the freedom to act like someone of my own rank or give me my share of the inheritance, so that I can seek my fortune elsewhere. 
###OLIVER
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money? Beg? Well, sir, go inside. I’m not going to be bothered by you for long. You’ll get some of what you want. Now please leave me alone. 
###ORLANDO
I won’t bother you any more than necessary. 
###OLIVER
(to ADAM) And you get lost too, you old dog. 
###ADAM
Is that my reward—to be called “old dog?” Well, it’s true, I’ve served this family so long I’ve gotten old and toothless, like a dog. God bless my old master. He would never have spoken to me like this. 
## ORLANDO and ADAM exit.
###OLIVER
Is that how it’s going to be? Are you starting to challenge me? I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis! 
## DENNIS enters.
###DENNIS
Did you call for me, your Worship? 
###OLIVER
Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me? 
###DENNIS
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you. 
###OLIVER
Call him in. 
## DENNIS exits.
I have a good plan. And tomorrow is the wrestling match. 
## CHARLES enters.
###CHARLES
Good morning, sir. 
###OLIVER
Good Mr. Charles! Tell me, what’s the latest news at the new court? 
###CHARLES
No news but the old news: the old Duke Senior has been banished by his younger brother, the new Duke Frederick. A few loyal lords have gone into exile with Duke Senior, and given up their lands and money to Frederick—so he’s happy enough to have them leave. 
###OLIVER
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished? 
###CHARLES
Oh, no. Duke Frederick’s daughter, Celia, grew up with Rosalind, and Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have either followed her into exile or died of grief. Rosalind has stayed at court, where Duke Frederick loves her like his own daughter. No two women ever loved each other like they do. 
###OLIVER
Where will the old duke live? 
###CHARLES
They say he’s already in the Forest of Arden. He has many cheerful men with him, and they live like Robin Hood and his outlaws. People say that new batches of young men flock there every day, and that they all pass the time without a care, like people did in the Golden Age. 
###OLIVER
So, are you going to wrestle before the new duke tomorrow? 
###CHARLES
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem. I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise. Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed. Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me. I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine. 
###OLIVER
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you. I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined. I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother. So use your discretion. I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger. And you’d better be careful, because if you embarrass him at all—in fact, if he doesn’t beat you thoroughly—he’ll come after you and won’t leave you alone till he’s poisoned you or trapped you—killed you, in other words, one way or another. It brings me to tears to say this, but there isn’t another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked. Because he’s my brother, I have to take his side. But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking. 
###CHARLES
I’m very glad I came to see you. If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him. If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again. Farewell, my lord. 
###OLIVER
Take care, Charles. 
## CHARLES exits.
Now it’s time to get this playboy brother of mine all worked up. I hope I’ll see the end of him soon—I don’t know why, but I hate nothing in the world as much as him, though he’s an upstanding guy. He’s never gone to school but he’s smart, with good values, and everyone is delighted by him and loves him, especially my subjects, who know him the best. They love him, and therefore they despise me. But not for long; Charles will take care of everything. All I have to do is get Orlando to fight, which I’ll do now. 
##He exits.
## CELIA and ROSALIND enter.
###CELIA
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy. 
###ROSALIND
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier? Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy. 
###CELIA
Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you. If your father had banished my father, I could have learned to love your father as my own, as long as I still had you. You’d do the same, if your love for me were as true as mine for you. 
###ROSALIND
Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours. 
###CELIA
You know I’m my father’s only child, and he isn’t likely to have another. And when he dies, you will inherit his fortune—because whatever he took from your father by force, I will return to you as affection. I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster. So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy. 
###ROSALIND
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us. Let me see—what do you think about falling in love? 
###CELIA
Yes, please do, so we can have a good laugh about it. But don’t fall in love for real, and don’t take the game too far. You want to get out of it easily, and with your honor intact. 
###ROSALIND
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead? 
###CELIA
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally. 
###ROSALIND
I wish we could do that, because Fortune gives all of her gifts to the wrong people, and she especially gets things wrong where women are concerned. 
###CELIA
It’s true: the women she makes beautiful she also makes slutty, and the women she makes pure and virginal she also makes ugly. 
###ROSALIND
No, you’re getting Fortune and Nature mixed up: Nature determines how we’re made, and Fortune decides what happens to us. 
## TOUCHSTONE enters.
###CELIA
Oh, really? Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all? And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, and now Fortune is playing a nasty trick on Nature: she’s breaking up a show of wit between two naturally witty women with the arrival of a natural fool. 
###CELIA
Well, maybe this is Nature’s work after all. Maybe Nature sensed that we’re not smart enough to be having this high-flown discussion about goddesses, so she sent us this fool to use as a mental whetstone. After all, smart peoples' wits are always sharpened by the presence of a fool. What’s up, you wit? Where are you wandering off to? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Mistress, you have to go see your father. 
###CELIA
Did they make you the messenger? 
###TOUCHSTONE
No, by my honor, but they told me to come get you. 
###ROSALIND
Where’d you learn a phrase like, “by my honor,” fool? 
###TOUCHSTONE
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad. Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying. 
###CELIA
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave. 
###CELIA
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave. 
###TOUCHSTONE
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave. But you can’t swear by what you don’t have—and this knight had no honor, or if he did, he swore it off before he ever saw those pancakes and that mustard. 
###CELIA
Tell me, who is this knight? 
###TOUCHSTONE
A man old Frederick, your father, loves. 
###CELIA
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me. Enough of this. No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days. 
###TOUCHSTONE
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do. 
###CELIA
Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were silenced, the foolishness of wise men has become all the more apparent. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau. 
## LE BEAU enters.
###ROSALIND
With his mouth full of news. 
###CELIA
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young. 
###ROSALIND
Then we’ll be stuffed with news. 
###CELIA
Well that’s good. If we’re fattened up, we’ll be worth more. Hello, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s the news? 
###LE BEAU
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport. 
###CELIA
Sport? Of what color? 
###LE BEAU
What color, madam? I don’t understand—how should I answer that? 
###ROSALIND
However your wit and luck allow. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Or however the Destinies say you should. 
###CELIA
Nicely done; you laid that on thick. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, if I don’t keep up my rank— 
###ROSALIND
—you’ll lose your smell. 
###LE BEAU
You’re confusing me, ladies. I was going to tell you all about a good wrestling match that’s going on, which you’re missing. 
###ROSALIND
Tell us about this wrestling. 
###LE BEAU
I’ll tell you about the beginning, and if you find that interesting you can see the end. The best is yet to come, and they’re going to perform it right here. 
###CELIA
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried. 
###LE BEAU
There comes an old man with his three sons— 
###CELIA
It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale. 
###LE BEAU
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence— 
###ROSALIND
Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these presents—” 
###LE BEAU
The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler. Immediately, Charles threw the brother, breaking three of his ribs; it’s not likely he will survive. Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third. They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, dear! 
###TOUCHSTONE
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing? 
###LE BEAU
Why, the one I just told you about. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Men must be getting wiser every day; that’s the first time I’ve heard that rib-breaking was appropriate entertainment for ladies. 
###CELIA
Me too, I swear. 
###ROSALIND
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs? Does anyone else love rib breaking? Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin? 
###LE BEAU
You’re going to have to, if you stay here. This is the place they’re scheduled to wrestle, and they’re ready to go. 
###CELIA
Yes, I see them coming. Let’s stay and watch. 
##Trumpets play. DUKE FREDERICK, lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and attendants enter.
###DUKE FREDERICK
Come on. Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness. 
###ROSALIND
Is that the man? 
###LE BEAU
That’s him, madam. 
###CELIA
Alas, he is too young. Yet he seems capable. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
What’s up, daughter and niece? Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man. Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen. Talk to him, ladies. See if you can persuade him. 
###CELIA
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Go ahead. I’ll make myself scarce. 
##He steps aside.
###LE BEAU
Mister Challenger, the princess wants to speak to you. 
###ORLANDO
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty. 
###ROSALIND
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler? 
###ORLANDO
No, lovely princess. He is the general challenger. I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth. 
###CELIA
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age. You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength. If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously. We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up. 
###ROSALIND
Please, young sir. We’ll make sure your reputation isn’t hurt; we’ll take it upon ourselves to argue with the duke that the wrestling match should be called off. 
###ORLANDO
I beg you not to think poorly of me—though I suppose anyone who could deny anything to such beautiful women deserves to be scorned. But please, send me good thoughts in this match. If I’m beaten, the shame is all mine, and I wasn’t in anyone’s good graces to begin with. If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead. I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world. In this world, I’m only taking up space. If I leave, maybe someone more worthy will fill it. 
###ROSALIND
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have. 
###CELIA
Mine too, to join hers. 
###ROSALIND
Good luck. I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances. 
###CELIA
I hope you get what you desire! 
###CHARLES
Come on, where’s the young show-off who’s so eager to lie with mother earth? 
###ORLANDO
Ready, sir, but I have more modest ambitions. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You get only one round. 
###CHARLES
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first. 
###ORLANDO
You should mock me after you’ve beaten me, not before. Come on. 
###ROSALIND
Hercules give you speed, young man! 
###CELIA
I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg. 
##They wrestle.
###ROSALIND
Oh, what an excellent young man! 
###CELIA
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground. 
## ORLANDO throws Charles. The crowd shouts.
###DUKE FREDERICK
No more, no more. 
###ORLANDO
Oh, come on, your Grace—I’m barely out of breath. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
How are you doing, Charles? 
###LE BEAU
He can’t speak, my lord. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Carry him away. What is your name, young man? 
###ORLANDO
Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
I wish you were someone else’s son. The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy. Your victory would have pleased me more if you’d been someone else’s son. But good luck; you are a brave young man. I wish you had told me you had a different father. 
## DUKE FREDERICK, his train, and LE BEAU exit.
###CELIA
If I were my father, cousin, would I do this? 
###ORLANDO
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir. 
###ROSALIND
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion. If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight. 
###CELIA
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him. My my father’s rude and envious behavior is like a knife through my heart. (to ORLANDO) Sir, you fought very well. If you live up to your potential in love as well, your wife will be a very happy woman. 
###ROSALIND
(giving him a chain from her neck) Gentleman, wear this for me. I’m a woman who’s down on her luck, and I’d give more if I could. Shall we go, cousin? 
###CELIA
Yes. Good luck, fair gentleman. 
###ORLANDO
(to himself) Can’t I even say “thank you”? I left my brain back on the wrestling field. What’s left of me is a dummy, just a lifeless block. 
###ROSALIND
He’s calling us back. My pride fell when my fortunes did; I’ll ask him what he wants.—Did you call us, sir? Sir, you wrestled well and conquered more than just your enemies. 
###CELIA
Will you come on, cousin? 
###ROSALIND
I’m coming. Farewell. 
## ROSALIND and CELIA exit.
###ORLANDO
What is this passion that ties up my tongue? I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to. Oh, poor Orlando, you’ve been overthrown! Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you. 
## LE BEAU enters.
###LE BEAU
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place. Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done. The duke is temperamental. I’m sure you can imagine what I mean without my having to spell it out. 
###ORLANDO
Thank you, sir. Now please tell me this: which of the two ladies who were at the wrestling match is the duke’s daughter? 
###LE BEAU
Neither one is his daughter, to judge from their good manners. But really, the smaller one is his daughter. The other is the daughter of the banished duke. Duke Frederick keeps her for his daughter’s sake; the love between the two of them is stronger than the bond between sisters. But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake. I swear, one day the duke’s malice toward Rosalind will suddenly erupt. Goodbye, sir. Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you. 
###ORLANDO
I’m indebted to you. Goodbye. 
## LE BEAU exits.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother! But, oh, heavenly Rosalind! 
##He exits.
## CELIA and ROSALIND enter.
###CELIA
What’s going on, Rosalind? Cupid have mercy! You won’t utter a single word? 
###ROSALIND
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog. 
###CELIA
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs. Throw some of your words at me. Come on, throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog. 
###ROSALIND
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any. 
###CELIA
Is all of this about your father? 
###ROSALIND
No, some of it is about my child’s father. Oh, this working-day world is full of thorns! 
###CELIA
They’re only burrs, cousin, thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior. If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats. 
###ROSALIND
Those burrs I could shake off my clothing, but these are in my heart. 
###CELIA
Cough them up. 
###ROSALIND
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him. 
###CELIA
Come on, take control of your feelings. 
###ROSALIND
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself. 
###CELIA
Oh, that’s a good wish! You’ll fight with him eventually, and fall. But let’s put these jokes aside for a moment, and speak earnestly. Is it possible that you could have fallen in love with Orlando, Sir Rowland’s youngest son, this suddenly? 
###ROSALIND
The duke, my father, loved his father very much. 
###CELIA
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son? By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father. But I don’t hate Orlando. 
###ROSALIND
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake. 
###CELIA
Why shouldn’t I? Doesn’t he deserve it? 
###ROSALIND
Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do. Look, here comes the duke. 
## DUKE FREDERICK enters, with lords
###CELIA
He looks angry. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court. 
###ROSALIND
Me, uncle? 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You, niece. In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it. 
###ROSALIND
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed. If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
All traitors protest like this. If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself. I don’t trust you. Enough said. 
###ROSALIND
But your mistrust alone can’t make me a traitor—on what basis do you suspect me? 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You are your father’s daughter. That’s enough. 
###ROSALIND
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom. I was his daughter when you banished him. Treason is not inherited, my lord. But even if we did inherit it from our family, what does that have to do with me? My father wasn’t a traitor. So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name. 
###CELIA
Dear master, listen to me. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake. Otherwise, she would have been banished with her father. 
###CELIA
At that time, I didn’t beg you to keep her here; you wanted her here, and you felt guilty. I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her. If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I. We have always slept together, woken up together, learned, played, and eaten together. Wherever we went, we went together and inseparable. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
She’s too devious for you. Her smoothness, her silence, and her patient suffering appeal to the people, and they pity her. You’re a fool. She’s robbing you of the attention you deserve. You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture. So be quiet. The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable. She is banished. 
###CELIA
Then lay that sentence on me too, my lord. I cannot live without her. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave. On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die. 
##Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and lords
###CELIA
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go? Do you want to exchange fathers? I’ll give you mine. I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am. 
###ROSALIND
I have more reason to be distressed. 
###CELIA
No you haven’t, cousin. Please, be cheerful. Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter? 
###ROSALIND
No, he hasn’t. 
###CELIA
Oh, he hasn’t? Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one. Will we be separated? Should we part, sweet girl? No. Let my father find another heir. So, help me plan how we’ll escape, where we’ll go, and what we’ll take with us. Don’t even try to take this all upon yourself, bearing your grief alone and leaving me out. I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say. 
###ROSALIND
But where will we go? 
###CELIA
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father. 
###ROSALIND
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far! Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money. 
###CELIA
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt. You do the same, and we’ll be able to travel without attracting any attackers' attention. 
###ROSALIND
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man? I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart. We’ll maintain a swaggering, warrior look, like so many cowardly men, whose manner has nothing to do with what they’re feeling. 
###CELIA
What should I call you when you’re a man? 
###ROSALIND
I’ll take no lesser name than that of Jove’s own servant. So call me Ganymede. And what will you be called? 
###CELIA
Something that refers to my current state. Instead of Celia, call me Aliena. 
###ROSALIND
Cousin, what if we brought that clownish fool of your father’s court, Touchstone? Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels? 
###CELIA
He’d walk the whole wide world with me. Leave me alone to go convince him. Let’s go gather our jewels and money. We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone. Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment. 
##They exit.
## DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS enter, dressed like foresters.
###DUKE SENIOR
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance? Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues? Out here we feel the changing of the seasons, but we’re not bothered by it. When the icy fangs of the brutal, scolding wind bite and blow on my body, even though I’m shivering with cold, I can appreciate the weather’s honesty. I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous toad that wears a precious jewel in its forehead. In this life, far away from the civilized world, we can hear the language of the trees, read the books of the running streams, hear sermons in the stones, and discover the good in every single thing. 
###AMIENS
I wouldn’t change my situation for anything. You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner? It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows. 
###FIRST LORD
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths. He swears that when you kill the deer, you’re a worse usurper than your brother was for banishing you. Today, Lord Amiens and I followed Jaques. We saw him lie down along a brook under an oak tree whose ancient roots peeked out from the earth. A poor, lonely stag who had been hurt by a hunter’s arrow came to rest there, where he heaved such heavy groans that the effort seemed to stretch his hide to bursting. Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose. The hairy fool, watched closely by sad Jaques, stood on the very edge of the brook, adding his own tears to the streaming water. 
###DUKE SENIOR
And what did Jaques say? Didn’t he take the opportunity to draw a moral from the scene? 
###FIRST LORD
Oh, yes, he created a thousand comparisons. First, he spoke of the deer’s needless addition to the stream’s water supply. “Poor deer,” he said, “you’re just like a human: you add more to what already has too much.” Then, about the deer’s being alone, abandoned by his velvety companions: “It’s appropriate,” he said, “that a miserable creature should excuse itself from company.” Just then, a carefree herd of deer, having just eaten their fill of pasture grass, bounded along without stopping to greet their wounded brother. “Sure,” said Jaques, “hurry on, you fat and greasy citizens. Why stop and notice this poor, broken, bankrupt creature here?” In this way, he most insightfully pierced to the heart of the country, the city, the court, and even our lives out here in the forest, swearing that we are mere usurpers and tyrants, frightening and killing animals in their own homes. 
###DUKE SENIOR
And did you leave him like this? 
###SECOND LORD
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Take me to him. I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say. 
###FIRST LORD
I’ll bring you to him right away. 
##They all exit.
## DUKE FREDERICK enters, with LORDS 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave? It cannot be. Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen. 
###FIRST LORD
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave. Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty. 
###SECOND LORD
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing. Hisperia, the princess’s gentlewoman, confesses that she overheard your daughter and her cousin praising the good looks and skills of the wrestler who recently beat the muscular Charles. Hisperia believes that, wherever they have gone, that young man is likely with them. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
Send a message to his brother. Bring that swinger Orlando here. If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me. I’ll make Oliver find him. Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways. 
##They all exit.
## ORLANDO and ADAM enter from opposite sides of the stage.
###ORLANDO
Who’s there? 
###ADAM
My young master! Oh, my gentle master! My sweet master! Oh, you living memory of old Sir Rowland! What are you doing here? Why are you so strong and good? Why do people love you? And why are you noble, strong, and brave? Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion? Your praise has beaten you home. Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in? Yours are like that—complete and utter traitors to you. Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him! 
###ORLANDO
Why, what’s the matter? 
###ADAM
Oh, unlucky boy! Don’t walk through these doors. In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you. Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it. And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you. I overheard him and his plans. This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse. Hate it, fear it, do not come inside. 
###ORLANDO
Then where would you have me go, Adam? 
###ADAM
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here. 
###ORLANDO
What, would you have me beg for my food? Or become a lowlife, sticking up travelers on the road? This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it. I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers. 
###ADAM
But don’t do that. I have five-hundred gold coins, which I carefully saved when I was working for your late father. I meant to use it for my retirement, to help me when my old body was lame and forgotten in some dark corner. But take the money, and God, who feeds even the raven and looks after even the sparrow, will comfort me in my old age. Here is the gold, I give it all to you. Let me be your servant. I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly. Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly. Let me go with you. I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you. 
###ORLANDO
Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money. Your approach isn’t the fashion these days, when no one works hard except for a promotion, and, as soon as they’ve got it, they stop working. But in working for me, old man, you are pruning a rotten tree: despite all your pains and efforts, it won’t yield a single blossom. Come along, though. We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living. 
###ADAM
Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath. From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more. Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late. But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything. 
##They exit.
## ROSALIND (dressed as Ganymede), CELIA (dressed as Aliena), and TOUCHSTONE enter.
###ROSALIND
Oh Lord, my spirits are tired! 
###TOUCHSTONE
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired. 
###ROSALIND
I’d insult my manly wardrobe by weeping like a woman if I didn’t have to comfort the weaker vessel here, as the jacket and hose ought to be brave for the sake of the petticoat. So, have courage, good Aliena. 
###CELIA
Please bear with me. I can’t go any further. 
###TOUCHSTONE
I’d rather bear with you than bear you. But if I did carry you, it would be no cross to bear, because I’m pretty sure you don’t have any money. 
###ROSALIND
Well, this is the Forest of Arden. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool. When I was at home, I was in a better place. But travelers have to be content. 
###ROSALIND
Yes, be content, good Touchstone. 
## CORIN and SILVIUS enter.
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk. 
###CORIN
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually. 
###SILVIUS
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her! 
###CORIN
I’m sure I can guess. I have been in love too, you know. 
###SILVIUS
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long. If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to? 
###CORIN
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten. 
###SILVIUS
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me. If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved. Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved. Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved. O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe! 
##He exits.
###ROSALIND
Oh, poor shepherd! Listening to you speak of your wounded heart reminds me of my own pain. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Me too. I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile. I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked. I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things. But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love. 
###ROSALIND
You speak more wisely than you know. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it. 
###ROSALIND
By God! This shepherd’s condition is like my own. 
###TOUCHSTONE
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it. 
###CELIA
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him. I’m faint with hunger. 
###TOUCHSTONE
(to CORIN) Hey, clown! 
###ROSALIND
Shut up, fool. He’s not your relative. 
###CORIN
Who’s calling? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Your superiors. 
###CORIN
If they weren’t my betters, they’d be pretty wretched indeed. 
###ROSALIND
(to TOUCHSTONE) Stop it, I say.—Good evening to you, friend. 
###CORIN
Good evening to you, too, noble sir, and to all of you. 
###ROSALIND
Please sir, if love or money can buy anything in this empty place, tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves. We’ll pay you for the information. We have a young woman here who is very tired from traveling and faint with hunger. 
###CORIN
Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her. But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend. My master is a brutish man and doesn’t care much if he gets to heaven by deeds of hospitality or not. Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house. But let’s see what’s on hand. If I have anything to say about it, you will be most welcome there. 
###ROSALIND
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture? 
###CORIN
That young man who was just here. But he doesn’t really care about buying anything. 
###ROSALIND
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it. 
###CELIA
And we will raise your wages. I like this place. I could see myself wasting time here. 
###CORIN
The thing is definitely going to be sold. Come with me. If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away. 
##They all exit.
## AMIENS, JAQUES, and others enter.
###AMIENS
(singing) Whoever wants to lie with me, Under the greenwood tree, And turn his merry song To follow the sweet bird’s singing, Come here, come here, come here. Here you will find No enemy Besides winter and rough weather. 
###JAQUES
More, more, please, more. 
###AMIENS
It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques. 
###JAQUES
I’m glad about that. More, please, more. I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs. More, please, more. 
###AMIENS
My voice is ragged. I know I won’t please you. 
###JAQUES
I don’t want you to please me, I want you to sing. Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”? 
###AMIENS
Call them whatever you want, Monsieur Jaques. 
###JAQUES
Nah, I don’t care what their names are; they owe me nothing. Will you sing? 
###AMIENS
Okay, but only because you want me to. 
###JAQUES
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now. But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together. Whenever a man compliments me, I feel like he’s a beggar and I just gave him a penny—an embarrassing exchange. Come on, sing—and those of you who won’t sing, shut up. 
###AMIENS
Well, I’ll finish the song I started.—Meanwhile, sirs, set the table. The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know. 
###JAQUES
And I’ve been avoiding him all day. He’s too argumentative for me. I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it. Come, warble for me. 
###EVERYONE
(singing) Whoever shuns ambition And loves to live in the sun, Hunting the food he eats Pleased with what he finds, Come here, come here, come here. Here he will findNo enemy But winter and rough weather. 
###JAQUES
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative. I’ll give it you. 
###AMIENS
And I’ll sing it. (taking a paper fromJAQUES) It goes like this: (sings) If it should come to pass That any man turns into an ass And leaves his wealth and ease Simply to please his stubborn will Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame. Here he will see Fools as stupid as he If he will only come to me. 
###AMIENS
What’s that word “ducdame”? 
###JAQUES
It’s a Greek invocation, calling fools into a circle. I’m going to take a nap, if I can—if I can’t, I’ll curse all the first-born children of Egypt. 
###AMIENS
And I’ll go find the duke; his banquet is ready. 
##They all exit in separate directions.
## ORLANDO and ADAM enter.
###ADAM
Dear master, I can’t go any farther. Oh, I’m dying of hunger. I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master. 
###ORLANDO
Hey, what’s this, Adam? No braver than this? Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little. If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you. You’re not as close to death as you think you are. For my sake, make yourself comfortable; keep death at arm’s length for a while. I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die. But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts. There we go! You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly. But you’re lying out in the cold. Come, I’ll carry you to shelter. And you won’t die for lack of dinner, if there’s anything at all to eat in this desert-like forest. Cheer up, good Adam. 
##They exit.
## DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS enter, dressed like outlaws.
###DUKE SENIOR
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man. 
###FIRST LORD
My lord, he just left here. He was happy here, listening to a song. 
###DUKE SENIOR
If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe. Go find him. Tell him I want to speak with him. 
## JAQUES enters.
###FIRST LORD
He saved me the trouble: here he comes. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Well, what’s going on, mister? What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company? What, you look amused. 
###JAQUES
A fool, a fool! I met a fool in the forest, wearing motley. What a miserable world! As sure as I eat to stay alive, I met a fool who was lying in the sun and complaining about his fortune. He spoke smartly, though he was a fool. “Good morning, fool,” I said. “No, sir,” he said, “don’t call me a fool until heaven has sent me my fortune.” 
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock. This way, we can see how the world moves. Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven. And so, from hour to hour we ripen, and from hour to hour we rot. And there’s a story behind that.” When I heard that motley fool moralizing on the subject of time, I began to crow like a rooster. Hearing a fool speaking so contemplatively made me laugh non-stop for an hour. Oh, noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley is the only thing to wear. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Who is this fool? 
###JAQUES
A worthy fool! He’s been a courtier and says, “If ladies are young and pretty, they always know it.” His brain is dry as a sailor’s biscuit and crammed with all sorts of strange observations, which he presents in mangled fashion. Oh, I wish I were a fool! I’m ambitious for one of those motley coats. 
###DUKE SENIOR
You shall have one. 
###JAQUES
That’s all I ask from you, as long as you promise to rid yourself of any rotten idea that I am wise. Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do. And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest. Why, sir, must he? Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church. Any person who thinks I’m satirizing them would be stupid if they didn’t pretend not to be hurt by my joke. Otherwise, they’d be admitting I was talking about them, and the fool would expose the wise man’s foolishness with a joke that wasn’t even meant for him. Dress me up in motley. Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine. 
###DUKE SENIOR
To hell with you! I know what you’d do. 
###JAQUES
What would I do besides good? 
###DUKE SENIOR
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large. 
###JAQUES
But if I cry out against pride in general, how can anyone say I’m accusing a particular person? Aren’t we talking about a problem as vast as the sea, that keeps flowing until all the wealth in the world is almost used up by everyone showing off? 
What woman in the city am I talking about when I say that the clothes on a city-woman’s unworthy back are rich enough to suit a prince? Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her? And when some lowlife protests that his fancy clothes aren’t my problem, isn’t he basically admitting that I’m talking about him? Well, then. Tell me how I’ve wronged him. If I was right about him, he’s the one who’s done wrong. If he isn’t guilty of the faults I’m talking about, well then, my accusations fly by like wild geese, whom no one owns, since they don’t apply to any man. But who is this? 
## ORLANDO enters with his sword drawn.
###ORLANDO
Stop, and eat no more. 
###JAQUES
But I haven’t eaten anything yet. 
###ORLANDO
And you won’t until the needy eat. 
###JAQUES
What kind of fighting cock is this? 
###DUKE SENIOR
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners? Why do you seem so lacking in civility? 
###ORLANDO
You were right the first time. My piercing distress has stripped me of smooth manners. But I wasn’t raised in the forest, and I was somewhat well-bred. But stop, I say. Whoever eats this fruit before I’ve been taken care of dies. 
###JAQUES
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die. 
###DUKE SENIOR
What would you like? Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does. 
###ORLANDO
I’m dying for food, so let me have some. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table. 
###ORLANDO
Do you really speak like such a gentleman? I beg your pardon. I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding. But whoever you are—you who sit in the dark shade, losing track of time in this remote forest—if you have ever seen better days or been to church or sat at a man’s table for a feast or wiped a tear from your eye, if you know what it is to pity and be pitied, let my kindness and nobility persuade you. With that hope, I’ll blush at my rudeness and put away my sword. 
###DUKE SENIOR
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs. 
###ORLANDO
Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food. There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles. He’s burdened by two debilitating evils—age and hunger. Until he’s fed, I won’t eat a thing. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Go find him. We won’t touch a thing till you return. 
###ORLANDO
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality. 
##He exits.
###DUKE SENIOR
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness. This wide, universal theater has more sad plays than our own little scene. 
###JAQUES
The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors. They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts. In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms. Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. Then he becomes a lover, huffing and puffing like a furnace as he writes sad poems about his mistress’s eyebrows. In the fourth act, he’s a soldier, full of foreign curses, with a beard like a panther, eager to defend his honor and quick to fight. 
On the battlefield, he puts himself in front of the cannon’s mouth, risking his life to seek fame that is as fleeting as a soap bubble. In the fifth act, he is a judge, with a nice fat belly from all the bribes he’s taken. His eyes are stern, and he’s given his beard a respectable cut. He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part. In the sixth act, the curtain rises on a skinny old man in slippers, glasses on his nose and a money bag at his side. The stockings he wore in his youth hang loosely on his shriveled legs now, and his bellowing voice has shrunk back down to a childish squeak. In the last scene of our play—the end of this strange, eventful history—our hero, full of forgetfulness, enters his second childhood: without teeth, without eyes, without taste, without everything. 
## ORLANDO enters carrying ADAM.
###DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Set the honorable old man down and let him eat. 
###ORLANDO
I thank you very much on his behalf. 
###ADAM
You had better do that. I can barely speak to thank you myself. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Eat. I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing. 
###AMIENS
(singing) Blow, blow, winter wind. You aren’t as harsh As men’s ingratitude.Your teeth aren’t as sharp, As you are invisible, Even though your breath is an assault. Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! Sing to the green holly. Most friendship is false, most love simply foolishness. Then heigh-ho, to the holly. This life is really jolly. Freeze, freeze, you bitter sky, Your bite isn’t as painful As when good deeds are forgotten. Even though you can freeze water Your sting is not as sharp As the friend who is forgotten. Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! Sing to the green holly. Most friendship is false, most love simply foolishness. Then heigh-ho, to the holly. This life is really jolly. 
###DUKE SENIOR
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here. I am the duke who loved your father. Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is. Give him your arm. Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me. 
##They all exit.
## DUKE FREDERICK enters, with lords and OLIVER.
###DUKE FREDERICK
You haven’t seen him since? Sir, sir, that can’t be true. If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place. But do this: find your brother, wherever he is. Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land. I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt. 
###OLIVER
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother. 
###DUKE FREDERICK
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands. Do this immediately, and send him packing. 
##They all exit.
## ORLANDO enters, holding a piece of paper.
###ORLANDO
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love. And you, goddess of the moon, queen of the night—with your chaste eye, from your pale home up above—watch your huntress, who has the power to control my life. Oh, Rosalind, these trees will be my books—I’ll write my thoughts down on their bark. That way, everyone who passes through this forest will find your virtues everywhere. Run, run, Orlando, on every tree carve praises of her beauty, her virtue, and her inexpressibility. 
##He exits.
## CORIN and TOUCHSTONE enter.
###CORIN
And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless. In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible. Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring. Being a simple life, it suits me very well, but being a life without plenty, it doesn’t suit me at all. Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd? 
###CORIN
Only in that I know that the sicker one gets, the worse one feels, and that the man who lacks money, employment, and happiness is without three good friends. I know that rain makes things wet and fire burns things. I know that a good pasture makes sheep fat, that the main cause of night is the absence of sun, and that the man who isn’t smart by nature and hasn’t learned anything from his schooling will complain of his lack of good manners, or he comes from very dull parents indeed. 
###TOUCHSTONE
You’re a natural-born philosopher! Were you ever at court, shepherd? 
###CORIN
Honestly, no. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Then you are damned. 
###CORIN
I hope not. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Yep, you’re damned like a roasted egg: all on one side. 
###CORIN
I’m damned for not having been at court? Explain. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation. You are in a perilous state, shepherd. 
###CORIN
Not at all, Touchstone. The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court. You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands. Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Give a quick example. Come, explain. 
###CORIN
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy. 
###TOUCHSTONE
What, don’t courtiers' hands sweat? And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat? That’s a poor example. A better example—come on. 
###CORIN
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Then your lips will feel them more quickly. Shallow thinking, yet again. Come on. 
###CORIN
Our hands are often covered in tar, from performing surgery on our sheep.Would you have us country folks kiss each other’s tarred hands? Courtiers' hands are perfumed. 
###TOUCHSTONE
You shallow thinker! You worthless man! You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak. Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar. Fix your example, shepherd. 
###CORIN
Your wit is too courtly for me. I’ll rest now. 
###TOUCHSTONE
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned? God help you, foolish man. Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed. 
###CORIN
Sir, I’m a true, simple laborer: I earn what I eat, get what I wear, hate no man, envy no man’s happiness, am happy for other men’s good fortune and satisfied with my own bad fortune, and the source of my greatest pride is watching my ewes graze and my lambs feed. 
###TOUCHSTONE
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation. You act as a pimp to a young ewe by forcing her to have sex with a crooked-headed, horny old ram—a totally unreasonable match. If you’re not damned for that, then the devil must be keeping shepherds out of hell; I can’t see how else you can hope to escape. 
###CORIN
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother. 
## ROSALIND enters, reading from a sheet of paper.
###ROSALIND
(reading, as Ganymede) From the far east to the west Indies There is no jewel like Rosalind. Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind. All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind. Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind. 
###TOUCHSTONE
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours. That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, stop, fool. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do. A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too. Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind. After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart. The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut. The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind. This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along. Why bother with them? 
###ROSALIND
Quiet, you stupid fool. I found them on a tree. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit. 
###ROSALIND
I’ll graft you onto that tree, and when I do I’ll be grafting onto it a medlar. The fruit the tree bears will be the earliest to ripen in the country because, God knows, you’ll be rotten before you’re half-ripe, which is how medlars are. 
###TOUCHSTONE
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely. 
## CELIA enters with a piece of paper.
###ROSALIND
Quiet! Here comes my cousin, reading something; step aside. 
###CELIA
(reading, as Aliena) Why should this place be a desert Just because there are no people in it? No, I’ll hang these poems on every tree, And they will voice the thoughts of a city. Some will be about how man’s brief life is spent in wandering, his entire life contained in the width of an open hand. Some poems will be about betrayals Committed by friends. But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman. Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain. Nature took Helen’s beautiful face, but not her fickle heart; Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty. 
So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all. Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, Lord—what tedious sayings about love have you been wearing out your congregation with? Shouldn’t you have warned, “Be patient, good people”? 
###CELIA
What are you saying?—Shoo, Shepherd, go a little ways away.—Go with him, Touchstone. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Come on, shepherd, let’s make an honorable retreat, though not with all the trappings of a full army; just with a shepherd’s pouch and the stuff he puts in it. 
## CORIN and TOUCHSTONE exit.
###CELIA
Were you listening to these verses? 
###ROSALIND
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too. Some of those lines had more feet than the verses could bear. 
###CELIA
That’s not a problem: the feet can bear the verses. 
###ROSALIND
Sure, but these feet were lame, and couldn’t have stood up without the support of the verses. They stood lamely in the verse. 
###CELIA
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees? 
###ROSALIND
I was working through my wonder when you arrived. Look at what I found on a palm tree. I haven’t been rhymed about like this since my past life, when I was an Irish rat, but I can hardly remember that. 
###CELIA
Do you know who wrote these? 
###ROSALIND
Was it a man? 
###CELIA
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck. Are you blushing? 
###ROSALIND
Please, who? 
###CELIA
Oh God, God! It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes. 
###ROSALIND
No, who are you talking about? 
###CELIA
Is it possible? 
###ROSALIND
No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is. 
###CELIA
Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful! And another wonderful, and beyond-my-ability-to-express wonderful! 
###ROSALIND
Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience? Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas. I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast. I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all. I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news. 
###CELIA
So you want to put a man in your belly. 
###ROSALIND
Did God make him? I mean, what sort of man is he? Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ? 
###CELIA
No, he has only a little beard. 
###ROSALIND
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him. I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on. 
###CELIA
It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant. 
###ROSALIND
Damn you for mocking me. Speak seriously and honestly. 
###CELIA
Really, cousin, it’s him. 
###ROSALIND
Orlando? 
###CELIA
Orlando. 
###ROSALIND
Oh no! What am I going to do in my man’s clothing? What did he do when you saw him? What did he say? How did he look? Where did he go? What brings him here? Did he ask about me? Where is he staying? How did he say good-bye? And when will you see him again? Answer me in a word. 
###CELIA
You’d better get me Gargantua’smouth first. The word’s too big for any mouth nowadays. Answering “yes” and “no” to all those questions would be harder than answering a catechism. 
###ROSALIND
But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing? Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling? 
###CELIA
It’s easier to count specks than to answer a lover’s millions of questions. But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention. I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn. 
###ROSALIND
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit. 
###CELIA
Let me talk, good lady. 
###ROSALIND
Go on. 
###CELIA
He lay there, stretched out like a wounded knight. 
###ROSALIND
Though that must have been a pitiful sight, the ground looked beautiful. 
###CELIA
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please. It’s leaping about like a frisky horse. He was dressed like a hunter. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, that’s ominous! He has come to kill my heart. 
###CELIA
I’d like to sing my song solo. You’re making me go off-key. 
###ROSALIND
Don’t you know that I’m a woman? Whatever I think, I have to say. Sweetheart, go on. 
###CELIA
You’ve made me lose the tune. Quiet! Isn’t that him heading this way? 
## ORLANDO and JAQUES enter.
###ROSALIND
That’s him. Let’s slink off, and watch him from a hiding place. 
###JAQUES
Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone. 
###ORLANDO
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company. 
###JAQUES
Goodbye. Let’s meet as little as we can. 
###ORLANDO
I also hope that we can be better strangers. 
###JAQUES
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks. 
###ORLANDO
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly. 
###JAQUES
Your love’s name is Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, that’s it. 
###JAQUES
I don’t like her name. 
###ORLANDO
They weren’t looking to please you when they christened her. 
###JAQUES
How tall is she? 
###ORLANDO
Just as tall as my heart. 
###JAQUES
You’re sure full of smooth answers. Are you friendly with goldsmiths' wives, and memorized your little speeches off of their rings? 
###ORLANDO
No, but I can answer you just like those painted cloths, where I suppose you memorized all your questions. 
###JAQUES
You have a quick wit; I think it must be made out of Atalanta’s heels. Why don’t you sit down with me? The two of us can complain about our mistress—the world—and all our miseries. 
###ORLANDO
I won’t blame anyone in this world but myself, whose faults I’m most familiar with. 
###JAQUES
Your worst fault is being in love. 
###ORLANDO
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue. I’m tired of you. 
###JAQUES
Well, I was looking for a fool when I found you, so I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. 
###ORLANDO
He’s drowned in the brook: look in, and you’ll see him. 
###JAQUES
There I’ll see only myself. 
###ORLANDO
Which is either a fool or a nothing. 
###JAQUES
I’m not going to waste any more time with you. Goodbye, good Mr. Love. 
###ORLANDO
I’m glad to see you go. Adieu, good Mr. Depression. 
## JAQUES exits.
###ROSALIND
(speaking so that only CELIA can hear) I’m going to talk to him like I’m an insolent boy, so I can play a trick on him.—Can you hear me, forester? 
###ORLANDO
Very well. What do you want? 
###ROSALIND
(as Ganymede) Please, what’s the hour? 
###ORLANDO
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead. There’s no clock here in the forest. 
###ROSALIND
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour. 
###ORLANDO
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”? Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate? 
###ROSALIND
No, not at all, sir. Time travels at different speeds for different people. I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for. 
###ORLANDO
Okay, who does it trot for? 
###ROSALIND
Well, it trots for a young woman between the time she gets engaged and the time she marries: the time that’s passed may only be a week, but it always feels like seven years. 
###ORLANDO
Who does time amble for? 
###ROSALIND
For a priest who doesn’t know his Latin or a rich man who is free from the gout. The one sleeps easily because he isn’t up late studying and the other lives merrily because he’s free from pain. The first lacks the burden of intense, exhausting study, and the second is spared the burden of heavy, exhausting poverty. Time ambles for both men. 
###ORLANDO
Who does it gallop for? 
###ROSALIND
For a thief on his way to the gallows. Such a man walks as slowly as possible and, even so, gets there too soon. 
###ORLANDO
Who does it stand still for? 
###ROSALIND
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves. 
###ORLANDO
Where do you live, pretty young man? 
###ROSALIND
With this shepherdess, my sister, on the outskirts of the forest. We live like fringe on the edges of a petticoat. 
###ORLANDO
Were you born here? 
###ROSALIND
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born. 
###ORLANDO
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this. 
###ROSALIND
Many people have told me so. Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city. He knew too much about courtship, because he fell in love back there, and when he came here he constantly lectured against it. Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex. 
###ORLANDO
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of? 
###ROSALIND
There were no primary ones. All of women’s faults are as alike as one half-pence is to another. Each of a woman’s faults seems monstrous until you’re presented with the next one, which is just as bad. 
###ORLANDO
Please, tell me some of them. 
###ROSALIND
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick. There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks. He hangs his odes on the hawthorns and his elegies on the brambles—each of these poems praising to the heavens one “Rosalind.” Now if I could find this man, this dream-catcher, I would give him some good advice, because he is truly love-sick. 
###ORLANDO
Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of. Please, tell me your cure. 
###ROSALIND
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about. He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure. 
###ORLANDO
What did he say the symptoms were? 
###ROSALIND
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway. Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery. But you’re no such man. You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else. 
###ORLANDO
Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love. 
###ROSALIND
Make me believe it? You might as well make the one you love believe it, which she’s more likely to do than admit that she does—that’s one of the ways that women fool their own consciences. But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man. 
###ROSALIND
Are you really as in love as your poems declare? 
###ORLANDO
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her. 
###ROSALIND
Love is merely a form of insanity, and I tell you, lovers deserve the nuthouse just like crazy people do. The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too. But I promise it can be cured with some guidance. 
###ORLANDO
Have you ever cured anyone this way before? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, one, and this is how I did it. He had to imagine that I was the girl he was in love with. I made him woo me every day. When he did, being the changeable boy I am, I’d mope, act effeminate, switch moods, long for him, like him, be proud and standoffish, be dreamy, full of mannerisms, unpredictable, full of tears and then smiles; be passionate about everything, then nothing. Most boys and women act just like this. I’d like him one minute and despise him the next; cry for him, then spit at him—until finally I drove love out and anger in. He abandoned the world, and hid himself away in a monastery. So I cured him, and I’ll cure you just the same, leaving you as clean as a sheep’s heart, without one spot of love in you. 
###ORLANDO
I don’t want to be cured, boy. 
###ROSALIND
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me. 
###ORLANDO
By my faith in love, I will, then. Tell me where you live. 
###ROSALIND
Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live. Will you come? 
###ORLANDO
Wholeheartedly, good young man. 
###ROSALIND
No, you have to call me Rosalind.—Sister, you’re coming? 
##They all exit.
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter, with JAQUES following unseen.
###TOUCHSTONE
Come on, sweet Audrey. I’ll get your goats, Audrey. Well now, what do you think, Audrey? Am I the man for you, Audrey? Do my simple features please you? 
###AUDREY
Your features, God help us! What features? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, I’m out here with you and your goats, in the same way that the witty poet Ovid was abandoned to the barbaric Goths. 
###JAQUES
(to himself) Oh, knowledge put to such bad use is worse than a god cooped up in a hut. 
###TOUCHSTONE
When a man’s jokes fall that flat, it’s as depressing as getting a large bill for a short stay in a little room. Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical. 
###AUDREY
I don’t know what “poetical” means. Is it “chaste in word and action”? Does it mean being truthful? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial. Lovers are fond of poetry and often concoct great lies in their poems. 
###AUDREY
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical? 
###TOUCHSTONE
I do, in fact. Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying. 
###AUDREY
What, you don’t want me to be chaste? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Not really, unless you were ugly. Chastity and beauty together in one woman is like sweetening sugar with honey. 
###JAQUES
(to himself) A sensible fool. 
###AUDREY
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Yes, but wasting chastity on a dirty slut is like putting good meat in a dirty dish. 
###AUDREY
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly. Maybe sluttishness will follow. Be that as it may, I’m going to marry you. To that end, I’ve spoken with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar from the next village, and he’s promised to meet us here and marry us. 
###JAQUES
(to himself) This I’d like to see. 
###AUDREY
Well, God bless this marriage! 
###TOUCHSTONE
Amen. You know, some men, who have fear in their hearts, might falter at this point. After all, these woods aren’t a proper church, and there’s no congregation here but horned animals. But who cares? I’ll be brave. Horns may be hateful, but they’re also necessary. They say, “Many a man doesn’t know the full extent of what he owns.” Exactly: many a man will see no end to the horns his wife furnishes him with. 
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage. He didn’t do anything to get them. Horns? Well, there they are. Only for poor men? No, no. The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s. Is the single man lucky, then? No. Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead. Just as it’s better to be skilled at self-defense than it is to avoid fighting, it’s better to risk a horn by marrying. Here comes Sir Oliver. 
## SIR OLIVER MARTEXT enters.
Sir Oliver Martext, we’re glad to see you. Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel? 
###SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
Is there anyone to give the bride away? 
###TOUCHSTONE
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods. 
###SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal. 
###JAQUES
(coming forward) Go on, proceed—I’ll give her away. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Good evening, Mr. What’shisname. How are you, sir? We’re glad to see you. God bless you for being here. I’m very glad to see you. This is just a trifling matter here, sir. No, no, put your hat back on. 
###JAQUES
Do you want to get married, fool? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check. 
###JAQUES
And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar? Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you. This man here will slap you two together like two pieces of wood panelling. Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage. 
###TOUCHSTONE
(to himself) I’d rather have this guy marry us, because he is not likely to marry us well, and if we’re not married properly, I’ll have a better excuse later to leave my wife. 
###JAQUES
Come with me and let me advise you. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Come, sweet Audrey. We have to be married properly. Otherwise, we’ll be living in sin.—Goodbye, Sir Oliver. We’re not singing, Oh, sweet Oliver Oh, sweet Oliver Don’t leave me behind— but, Go away, wind Go, I say, I’m not going to marry you. 
## JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY exit.
###SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
It doesn’t matter to me. None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession. 
##He exits.
## ROSALIND and CELIA enter.
###ROSALIND
Don’t talk to me. I’m going to cry. 
###CELIA
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man. 
###ROSALIND
But don’t I have good reason to cry? 
###CELIA
As good a reason as any. So go ahead and cry. 
###ROSALIND
I mean, his hair is even red—the same color as that lying Judas. 
###CELIA
No, it’s a shade browner than Judas’s—but his kisses are just like Judas’s. 
###ROSALIND
No, really, his hair is a nice color. 
###CELIA
A very good color, this chestnut. 
###ROSALIND
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest. 
###CELIA
He must have bought a cast-iron pair of Diana’s lips: an elderly nun isn’t anymore devoted in her kissing than he is. His kiss is cold and chaste. 
###ROSALIND
But why would he promise to come visit me this morning and then not come? 
###CELIA
Really, he’s a total liar. 
###ROSALIND
Do you think so? 
###CELIA
Yes. He’s not a pickpocket or a horse thief, but when it comes to truth in love, he’s as hollow as a cup or a nut hollowed out by a worm. 
###ROSALIND
You think his feelings aren’t true? 
###CELIA
Oh, I think they are—when he’s in love. But he’s not in love. 
###ROSALIND
But you heard him swear up and down that he was. 
###CELIA
He “was,” but that doesn’t mean he is anymore. Besides, the promises of a lover are as untrustworthy as a bartender handing you an inflated tab: they both swear to their lies. He’s staying in the forest with your father now. 
###ROSALIND
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him. He asked me who my parents were, and I told him they were as good as he was. He laughed at that and let me go. But why are we talking about my father, when a man like Orlando exists? 
###CELIA
Oh, sure, he’s a brave man! He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely. He’s like a cowardly jouster, who breaks his lance across his opponent’s shield, rather than directly against it. But everything’s brave that a young man does and foolishness leads. 
## CORIN enters.
Who’s coming here? 
###CORIN
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with. 
###CELIA
Yes, what about him? 
###CORIN
If you’d like to see a scene played out between a man growing pale with unrequited love and a woman glowing with scorn and proud disdain, come with me a short distance and you’ll witness it. 
###ROSALIND
(speaking so that only CELIA can hear) Come on, let’s go. The sight of lovers nourishes whoever else is in love. (to CORIN) Bring us to this little show, and I’ll take a part in their play. 
##They all exit.
## SILVIUS and PHOEBE enter.
###SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me. Do not, Phoebe. Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly. The executioner, who’s seen death so much his heart has grown hard, still says, “forgive me” before he drops the axe on the criminal’s neck. Are you going to be crueler than the man who makes his living by killing? 
## ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN enter at the back of the stage, unseen.
###PHOEBE
I don’t want to be your executioner: I’m trying to avoid you so that I won’t hurt you. You tell me my eyes are murderous—that’s a very pretty sentiment, and oh-so-probable, that my frail, soft eyes (which are so cowardly that they close their gates against dust) are tyrants, butchers, and murderers. I’m frowning at you with all my might right now. If my eyes can injure, let them kill you now. Go ahead. Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers. Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused. If you get scratched with a pin, it leaves a scar; even if you lean on a rush, it leaves an impression on your palm. But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark. Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person. 
###SILVIUS
Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make. 
###PHOEBE
Well, until that time, don’t come near me. And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you. 
###ROSALIND
(coming forward, speaking as Ganymede) And why, please tell me? Is your mother a goddess that you would insult a wretched man, and exult over the injury you’ve caused him, all at the same time? You’re not beautiful—really, you’re not so pretty that you could go to bed with the lights on—so why must you act so proud and pitiless? Wait a minute, what’s going on? Why are you looking at me like that? I don’t see anything in you but nature’s usual handiwork.—Oh, for God’s sake, I think she also wants me to fall in love with her. No, proud woman, don’t hope for that. Not even your black eyebrows, your silky black hair, your beady black eyeballs, or your yellowish-white complexion can make me worship you. You foolish shepherd: why are you following her, raining tears and puffing hot air like a foggy south wind? You are a thousand times better than she. It’s fools like you who, marrying badly, fill the world with ugly children. It’s not her mirror but you who insists she’s beautiful. The image of herself that she gets from you is better than her actual features. 
But mistress, know yourself. Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man. I’m telling you, as a friend, that you should sell while the market’s good—you’re not going to have many more buyers. Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer. You’re already ugly, don’t make matters worse by being scornful, too. So take her, shepherd, and God bless you. 
###PHOEBE
Sweet boy, I’d rather hear you scold me for a whole year than this man woo me for a minute. 
###ROSALIND
He’s fallen in love with your sheer ugliness. (To SILVIUS ) And I think she’s falling in love with my anger. If I’m right, as soon as she answers you with frowns, I’ll rebuke her with bitter words. (to PHOEBE ) Why are you looking at me like that? 
###PHOEBE
I don’t wish you any harm. 
###ROSALIND
I’m telling you, don’t fall in love with me. I’m more false than the promises a man makes while drunk. Besides, I don’t like you. If you’d like to know where I live, my house is in the olive grove close by. —Come on, sister. —Shepherd, keep working on her. —Come on, sister. —Shepherdess, give him another chance. And don’t be proud. The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful. —Come on, to our sheep. 
## ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN exit.
###PHOEBE
Dead shepherd, now I understand what you meant when you said, “You’ve never loved until you’ve fallen in love at first sight.” 
###SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe— 
###PHOEBE
What? Did you say something, Silvius? 
###SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me. 
###PHOEBE
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius. 
###SILVIUS
But if you’re really sorry for me, you can cure me. If you’re sorry for the grief I feel in loving you, you can love me back. Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured. 
###PHOEBE
You have my friendship. Isn’t that enough? 
###SILVIUS
I want you. 
###PHOEBE
Well, that’s just greedy. Silvius, I used to hate you. I still don’t love you, but since you’re well-spoken when it comes to love, I’ll keep you around and make use of you. But don’t expect any more than that. 
###SILVIUS
My love for you is so pure and perfect, and I’m in such a bad way, that I’ll be grateful for whatever leftover love you throw my way. Every once in a while, toss me a distracted smile, and I’ll live on that. 
###PHOEBE
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me? 
###SILVIUS
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times. He’s bought the cottage and the grounds that the old peasant used to own. 
###PHOEBE
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him. He’s an irritable boy, though he speaks well. But what do I care about words? And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to. He’s good-looking, but not too good-looking. He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him. He’ll grow up to be a proper man. The best thing about him is his complexion: as fast as he offends me with words, his pretty face heals the wound. He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age. His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright. His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink. There are women out there, Silvius, who would have nearly fallen in love with him after inspecting him as closely as I have. But I don’t love him or hate him—though I suppose I have more reason to hate him than love him. What right did he have to scold me like that? He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me. I’m surprised I didn’t bite back. But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough. I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it. Will you do that for me, Silvius? 
###SILVIUS
With all my heart, Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
I’ll write it right now—the whole thing is pressing on my mind, and on my heart. I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt. Come with me, Silvius. 
##They exit.
## ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES enter.
###JAQUES
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better. 
###ROSALIND
They say you are a melancholy fellow. 
###JAQUES
I am. I like it better than laughing. 
###ROSALIND
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful. They make themselves targets for ridicule even faster than drunks do. 
###JAQUES
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet. 
###ROSALIND
In that case it’s good to be a post. 
###JAQUES
I’m not a scholar’s kind of melancholy, which is all about impressing one’s peers, or a musician’s, which comes from his passion for his art. I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer. My melancholy is not like a lady’s—which is nothing more than an affectation—nor like a lover’s, which combines all of these qualities. My melancholy is purely my own—a compound made from many ingredients. I’m serious because I’ve traveled so much. When I think about all the things I’ve seen, I sink into deep thoughts. 
###ROSALIND
You’re a traveler. Well then, you have good reason to be sad. I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s. To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands. 
###JAQUES
Not true. I gained my experience. 
###ROSALIND
And your experience makes you sad. I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less! 
## ORLANDO enters.
###ORLANDO
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind. 
###JAQUES
No—I’ll say goodbye if you’re going to talk in blank verse. 
###ROSALIND
Goodbye, Mr. Traveler. Make sure to keep up your foreign accent, wear strange clothes, belittle all the benefits you receive from your native land and fall out of love with it, and nearly curse God for making you look like the Englishman you are, or else I’ll never believe you’ve paddled in a gondola in a Venetian canal, as you say you have. 
## JAQUES exits.
(as Ganymede pretending to be ROSALIND ) What’s going on, Orlando? Where have you been all this time? And you call yourself a lover? If you ever insult me like this again, don’t bother coming around here again. 
###ORLANDO
My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late. 
###ROSALIND
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour? A man who will dare to meet his lover even a thousandth part of a minute late—well, it’s possible he likes her, but I doubt he really loves the woman. 
###ORLANDO
Forgive me, darling Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you. I’d rather be wooed by a snail. 
###ORLANDO
A snail? 
###ROSALIND
Yes, a snail. Because even though he’s slow, he carries his house on his head—a better offer than you can make a woman, I think. Besides, he brings his fate with him. 
###ORLANDO
What fate is that? 
###ROSALIND
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives. See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity. 
###ORLANDO
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous. 
###ROSALIND
And I am your Rosalind. 
###CELIA
(as Aliena) He likes calling you that, but he’s got another Rosalind out there with a prettier face. 
###ROSALIND
Come on, woo me, woo me. I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want. What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
I’d kiss you before I spoke. 
###ROSALIND
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say. When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss. 
###ORLANDO
What if she won’t kiss me? 
###ROSALIND
Then she’s making you beg, and that gives you a whole new set of things to talk about. 
###ORLANDO
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves? 
###ROSALIND
Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit. 
###ORLANDO
Would I be out of my suit? 
###ROSALIND
No, you’d still have your clothes on—but, yes, I wouldn’t think much of you. Aren’t I your Rosalind? 
###ORLANDO
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her. 
###ROSALIND
Well, on behalf of Rosalind, I’ll tell you I don’t want you. 
###ORLANDO
Then, on behalf of myself, I’ll tell you I’ll die. 
###ROSALIND
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy. This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love. Troilus may have wanted to die from love, and he’s now considered one of the great, tragic love heroes, but, in fact, a Greek with a club beat his brains out. It had nothing to do with love. Leander would have lived many more years if it hadn’t been for a particularly hot summer night, when he went swimming in the Hellespont, got a cramp, and drowned. The foolish poets of the time insisted he died for love, but they’re lying. All the love stories are lies. Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not because of love. 
###ORLANDO
I hope Rosalind doesn’t feel as you do. Her frown alone would kill me. 
###ROSALIND
No, her frown wouldn’t kill a fly. But come on, now I’ll play your Rosalind, and in a more friendly state of mind. Whatever you ask for, I’ll give. 
###ORLANDO
Then love me, Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest. 
###ORLANDO
And will you have me? 
###ROSALIND
Sure, and twenty others just like you. 
###ORLANDO
What’s that? 
###ROSALIND
Well, aren’t you a good man? 
###ORLANDO
I hope so. 
###ROSALIND
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister? 
###ORLANDO
Please, marry us. 
###CELIA
I can’t say the words. 
###ROSALIND
You just have to say, “Do you, Orlando—” 
###CELIA
Oh, stop it.—Do you, Orlando, take Rosalind to be your lawfully wedded wife? 
###ORLANDO
I do. 
###ROSALIND
Okay, but when? 
###ORLANDO
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows. 
###ROSALIND
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” 
###ORLANDO
I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife. 
###ROSALIND
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband. Look, I’ve sped ahead of the priest and answered the question before he even asked. A woman’s thoughts are always running ahead of her actions. 
###ORLANDO
So do all thoughts. They have wings. 
###ROSALIND
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her. 
###ORLANDO
Forever and a day. 
###ROSALIND
You might as well just say for “a day,” and forget the “ever” part. No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled. Women are as sweet and temperate as springtime when they’re single, but the climate changes once they’re married. I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey. I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood. And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena. 
###ORLANDO
But will my Rosalind do this, too? 
###ROSALIND
Indeed, she’ll act just like me. 
###ORLANDO
But she is wise. 
###ROSALIND
Right. If she weren’t wise, she wouldn’t be smart enough to behave badly. The wiser the woman, the wilder. If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window. If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole. If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke. 
###ORLANDO
A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” 
###ROSALIND
Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed. 
###ORLANDO
And what wit could excuse that? 
###ROSALIND
She’ll say she was at the neighbor’s looking for you. You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue. A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman. And she’s hardly fit to be a mother—her child will turn out to be a fool. 
###ORLANDO
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, no! Darling, I can’t live without you for two hours. 
###ORLANDO
I must join the duke for lunch. I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, go, leave me. I knew you’d turn out this way. My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too. But I was won over by your flattering words. I’m just another girl whom you’ve cast aside. So, take me, death! You’ll be back at two o'clock? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, sweet Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
Honestly, truly, in God’s name, and by all those little girly oaths that don’t actually have any power, if you break even a little bit of your promise, or if you come even a minute after two o'clock, I’ll think you the most pathetic promise breaker, the most lying lover, and the most unworthy partner for Rosalind that could be found anywhere. So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise. 
###ORLANDO
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind. So, goodbye. 
###ROSALIND
Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal. Time will tell what kind of a man you are. Goodbye. 
## ORLANDO exits.
###CELIA
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours. We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly. 
###ROSALIND
Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am. The bottom of my love is so deep it can’t be reached. It’s as deep as the bay of Portugal. 
###CELIA
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other. 
###ROSALIND
Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs. I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando. I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns. 
###CELIA
And I’m going to sleep. 
##They exit.
## JAQUES enters with LORDS, dressed like foresters.
###JAQUES
Which one of you killed the deer? 
###FIRST LORD
It was me, sir. 
###JAQUES
Let’s bring this man to the duke, like a triumphant Roman conqueror. Put the deer’s horns on his head, like a victory branch. Do you have a song, forester, for this occasion? 
###SECOND LORD
Yes, sir. 
###JAQUES
Then sing it. It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough. 
###SECOND LORD
(sings) What should we give to the man who killed this deer? Give him the hide and the horns to wear. Then sing this song to send him home (The other LORDS pick up the deer) Don’t be ashamed to wear the horns. They’ve been worn since before you were born. Your father’s father wore it, And your father endured it. The horn, the horn, the lustful horn Is not to be laughed at or scorned. 
##They all exit.
## ROSALIND and CELIA enter.
###ROSALIND
What do you say now? Isn’t it past two o'clock? And I see a lot of Orlando here. 
###CELIA
I’m telling you, he’s taken his bow and arrows and, with a pure love and a worried brain, has gone to take a nap. 
## SILVIUS enters.
Look who’s coming. 
###SILVIUS
(to ROSALIND) I’ve been sent to find you, young man. My lovely Phoebe told me to give you this letter. I don’t know what’s in it, but guessing from her stern expression and her wasp-like demeanor as she was writing it, I bet she’s angry. You’ll have to excuse me, as I’m just the messenger. 
###ROSALIND
(reading the letter as Ganymede) Patience herself would be shocked by this letter and become feisty. If I can take this, I can take anything. She says I’m not handsome and have no manners. She says I’m arrogant and that she couldn’t love me even if men were as rare as the mythical phoenix. Honestly! I’m not hunting after her love. Why would she write this way to me? Tell the truth, shepherd: you wrote this letter. 
###SILVIUS
No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it. Phoebe wrote it. 
###ROSALIND
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love. I saw her hands: they were as rough as leather and just as brown; I thought she was wearing old gloves, but they were, in fact, her hands. These are the hands of a hard-working housewife, but that’s not the point. The point is that she didn’t write this letter. These are a man’s words, and his handwriting. 
###SILVIUS
I’m telling you, it’s hers. 
###ROSALIND
Well, it’s written in a boisterous and rude style—someone is up for a fight. Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian. No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings. Do you want to hear what she says? 
###SILVIUS
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty. 
###ROSALIND
She’s Phoebe-ing me. Listen to what the tyrant says. (reading) “Are you a god disguised as a shepherd, that you know so expertly how to burn my heart?” Now, honestly, would a woman rant like this? 
###SILVIUS
You call that ranting? 
###ROSALIND
(reading) “Why have you set aside your divine nature just to battle with a woman’s affections?” Did you ever hear such ranting? (reading) “When other men have wooed me, they didn’t hurt me.” In other words, she thinks I’m not a man, but an animal. 
(reading) “If the scorn in your bright eyes can make me fall so deeply in love, can you imagine what power they might have if they looked at me more kindly? While you sneered at me, I loved you. Consider what effect kind prayers might have. The man that brings you this letter doesn’t know how I feel about you. Send me your answer via him. Tell me via him whether you will accept my faithful offer of myself and all that I can do. Or tell him you will deny my love, in which case I’ll figure out how to die.” 
###SILVIUS
You call this sneering? 
###CELIA
(as Aliena) Oh, you poor shepherd! 
###ROSALIND
Why do you pity him? He doesn’t deserve any pity. (to SILVIUS) Why would you love such a woman? So she can turn you into an instrument and play lousy tunes on you? It’s unbearable. Well, go back to her—I can tell she’s turned you into a perfectly tame snake—and tell her this: if she loves me, I command her to love you. And if she won’t love you, tell her I’ll never take her unless you beg me to. If you’re a true lover, get out of here. No, don’t say another word, because here comes more company. 
## SILVIUS exits.
## OLIVER enters.
###OLIVER
Good morning, pretty ones. Tell me, if you know: where in this forest is there a shepherd’s cottage surrounded by olive trees? 
###CELIA
West of here, in the valley next to us. Passing by on your right, there is a row of willows. Follow them straight to the cottage. But right now, the house is keeping to itself— there’s no one home. 
###OLIVER
I think I recognize you from a description I was given of your clothing and age: “The boy is pretty and feminine, and carries himself like a blooming young woman. The woman is short, with a darker complexion than her brother.” Aren’t you the owners of the house I was just asking about? 
###CELIA
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are. 
###OLIVER
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you? 
###ROSALIND
It is. What does this mean? 
###OLIVER
It’s a story that involves some shame on my part. It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained. 
###CELIA
Please, tell us. 
###OLIVER
When young Orlando left you last, he promised to return within an hour. He was pacing through the forest, thinking bittersweet thoughts of love, and listen what happened! He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back. A green and gold snake had wound itself around this man’s neck and was slowly making its way toward the man’s mouth. However, when it saw Orlando, it unwound itself and slunk away into a bush. But there happened to be a lioness crouching under that bush. Her cubs had nursed from her until she was dry, so she was ravenously hungry, and she was lying with her head on the ground, watching the man as cats do and waiting to see if he would wake up—a lion won’t prey on anything that seems dead. Seeing the lioness, Orlando approached the sleeping man. He discovered that the man was his older brother. 
###CELIA
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive. 
###OLIVER
And he was right. I know exactly how inhumane he was. 
###ROSALIND
But, back to Orlando, did he leave his brother there, to be food for the hungry mother-lioness? 
###OLIVER
He turned away twice and almost left him there. But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved. He fought the lioness and quickly defeated her. I woke from my miserable sleep when I heard the noise of their struggle. 
###CELIA
Are you his brother? 
###ROSALIND
Was it you that he rescued? 
###CELIA
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him? 
###OLIVER
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted. 
###ROSALIND
But what about the bloody handkerchief? 
###OLIVER
I’ll get there. When we had told each other our entire stories and cried, and I’d told him how I’d ended up in in the forest—well, he brought me to the duke, who gave me fresh clothing and hospitality, and put me in my brother’s care. My brother immediately took me to his cave, where he took off his clothing and there on his arm was a wound where the lioness had attacked him, ripping off some of his flesh. The wound had been bleeding the entire time. So, now he fainted, and as he fainted, he called out, “Rosalind!” Quickly, I resuscitated him and bound up his wound. After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man— 
he sent me out to find you, even though I’m a stranger to you. He wanted me to tell you this story and beg your forgiveness for his having broken his promise. He wanted me to give this handkerchief, soaked in his blood, to the boy that he jokingly calls his Rosalind. 
## ROSALIND faints.
###CELIA
Oh no! Ganymede! Ganymede, sweetheart? 
###OLIVER
Many people faint when they see blood. 
###CELIA
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede! 
###OLIVER
Look, he’s recovering. 
###ROSALIND
I want to go home. 
###CELIA
We’ll take you there. Please, will you take his arm? 
###OLIVER
Buck up, boy! You’re a man? You don’t have a man’s courage. 
###ROSALIND
It’s true, I confess. Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake. Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on. Whoo-hoo! 
###OLIVER
That was no show. Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint. 
###ROSALIND
Fake, I’m telling you. 
###OLIVER
Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man. 
###ROSALIND
That’s what I’m doing. But honestly, I should have been a woman. 
###CELIA
Come on, you keep getting paler. Please, let’s go home. Sir, please come with us. 
###OLIVER
I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
I’ll think of something. But please, tell him how well I faked a faint. Will you come with us? 
##They all exit.
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter.
###TOUCHSTONE
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey. Be patient. 
###AUDREY
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said. 
###TOUCHSTONE
No, he was wicked and vile. But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl. 
###AUDREY
Yes, I know who you’re talking about, but he has no claim on me. 
## WILLIAM enters. 
Here comes the man himself. 
###TOUCHSTONE
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin. Truly, we witty men can’t hold our tongues. We have to mess with the likes of him, we just can’t help it. 
###WILLIAM
Good evening, Audrey. 
###AUDREY
Good evening, William. 
###WILLIAM
And good evening to you, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Good evening to you, good friend. No, no, put your hat back on, put it back on. No, please, keep your head covered. How old are you, friend? 
###WILLIAM
Twenty-five, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
A mature age. Is your name William? 
###WILLIAM
Yes, it’s William, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
A good name. Were you born here in the forest? 
###WILLIAM
Yes sir, thank God. 
###TOUCHSTONE
“Thank God”—that’s a good answer. Are you rich? 
###WILLIAM
Well, so-so. 
###TOUCHSTONE
“So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer. And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so. Are you wise? 
###WILLIAM
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, that’s a fine answer. I seem to remember a saying: “Only a fool thinks he’s wise; the wise man knows that he is, in fact, a fool.” When one self-described philosopher wanted to eat grapes, he opened his lips when they entered his mouth, thereby making the theoretical point that grapes were made to be eaten, and lips to open. Do you love this girl? 
###WILLIAM
I do, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Give me your hand. Are you educated? 
###WILLIAM
No, sir. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it. Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty. And all the authorities know that ipse is Latin for “he.” You are no longer ipse, because I am he. 
###WILLIAM
Which he, sir? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Why, the he that will marry this woman. Therefore, idiot, abandon (or, in common language, “leave”) the society (which in the boorish tongue is “company”) of this female—maybe you’ll get it if I say “woman,” instead. Say it all at once, now: abandon the society of this female, or, simpleton, you’ll perish. Let me put it in a way you’ll understand: you’ll die. Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity. I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword. I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness. I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways. Therefore, tremble with fear and leave. 
###AUDREY
Do what he says, William. 
###WILLIAM
Farewell, sir. 
##He exits.
## CORIN enters.
###CORIN
Our master and mistress are looking for you. Let’s go. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming. 
##They all exit.
## ORLANDO and OLIVER enter.
###ORLANDO
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her? And fall in love with her after merely seeing her? And as soon as you fall in love, with her, woo her? And as soon as you woo her, have her accept? And do you really mean to marry her? 
###OLIVER
Don’t question the foolish haste of it all—or her poverty or our short time together or the abruptness of my courtship or the abruptness of her consent—but say with me, “I love Aliena.” And say with me that she loves me. Agree to this match, so we can enjoy each other. It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest. 
###ORLANDO
You have my consent. You can be married tomorrow if you want. I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers. Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind. 
## ROSALIND enters.
###ROSALIND
Hello, brother. 
###OLIVER
And hello to you, fair sister. 
##He exits.
###ROSALIND
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling. 
###ORLANDO
Actually, it’s my arm. 
###ROSALIND
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws. 
###ORLANDO
My heart has been wounded, but by a lady, not a lion. 
###ROSALIND
Did your brother tell you how well I pretended to faint when he showed me the handkerchief? 
###ORLANDO
Yes, and he told me some things that were even more amazing. 
###ROSALIND
Oh, I know what you’re talking about. It’s true: it was as sudden as two rams rushing at each other, and as quick as Julius Caesar’s “I came, I saw, I conquered.” Your brother and my sister had no sooner met than they gave each other a good once over; they had no sooner looked at each other than they fell in love; no sooner fell in love than they sighed; no sooner sighed than they asked each other why they had sighed; no sooner answered than they sought a solution. And in this way, degree by degree, they’ve built a staircase toward marriage. And they had better climb those stairs immediately, or else they’ll end up in bed before they ought to. They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together. You couldn’t beat the two of them apart. 
###ORLANDO
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony. But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes. Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for. 
###ROSALIND
Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow? 
###ORLANDO
I can’t live by pretending anymore. 
###ROSALIND
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat. You should know that I think you’re a smart man. I really mean it. I’m not telling you this so you’ll think well of me (who wouldn’t think well of someone who thought well of him, after all?) And I’m not trying to enhance my own reputation, but only to do you good. Believe me, then, that I have special powers. Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here. If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena. I know where she is and, if you don’t mind, I will set her before you tomorrow, whole and unharmed. 
###ORLANDO
Are you serious? 
###ROSALIND
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician. So put on your best clothes and tell your friends to come. Because if you want to be married tomorrow, you will, and if you want to be married to Rosalind, you will. 
## SILVIUS and PHOEBE enter.
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her. 
###PHOEBE
Young man, it was very rude of you to show him the letter I wrote you. 
###ROSALIND
I don’t care. I’m being contemptuous and cruel toward you on purpose. A faithful shepherd worships you. Why don’t you pay attention to him? Why don’t you love him? He adores you. 
###PHOEBE
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love. 
###SILVIUS
It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
And like I am for Ganymede. 
###ORLANDO
And like I am for Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
And like I am for no woman. 
###SILVIUS
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
And like I am for Ganymede. 
###ORLANDO
And like I am for Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
And like I am for no woman. 
###SILVIUS
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion. It means being humble, being patient, being impatient, being pure, being put-upon, being obedient. Just as I am for Phoebe. 
###PHOEBE
And I for Ganymede. 
###ORLANDO
And I for Rosalind. 
###ROSALIND
And I for no woman. 
###PHOEBE
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you? 
###SILVIUS
And why do you blame me for loving you? 
###ORLANDO
And why do you blame me for loving you? 
###ROSALIND
Who are you talking to? 
###ORLANDO
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me. 
###ROSALIND
All right, stop this. You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon. (to SILVIUS) I’ll help you, if I can. (to PHOEBE) If I could love you, I would. All of you, meet me here tomorrow. (to PHOEBE) If I’m ever going to marry a woman, I’ll marry you. And I am getting married tomorrow. (to ORLANDO) If I will ever satisfy a man, I’ll satisfy you. And you will get married tomorrow. (to SILVIUS) If the thing you desire will make you happy, I’ll make you happy. And you’ll get married tomorrow. (to ORLANDO) By the love you have for Rosalind, come back tomorrow. (to SILVIUS) By the love you have for Phoebe, come here tomorrow.—And by my love for no woman, I’ll also be here tomorrow. So, goodbye for now. You all know what to do. 
###SILVIUS
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here. 
###PHOEBE
Me too. 
###ORLANDO
Me too. 
##They all exit.
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter.
###TOUCHSTONE
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey. We’ll be married tomorrow. 
###AUDREY
I can’t wait. I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman. 
##Two PAGES enter.
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages. 
###FIRST PAGE
Good afternoon, good gentleman. 
###TOUCHSTONE
It really is good to see you. Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song. 
###SECOND PAGE
Sounds good to us. Sit between us. 
###FIRST PAGE
Should we just get down to it? Should we skip all that hacking and spitting and saying that we’re hoarse, which only makes clear what lousy singers we are? 
###SECOND PAGE
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse. 
###PAGES
(singing) There was a lover and his girl, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, Who walked through the cornfield In the springtime, the only proper wedding time, The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. Between the acres of rye, 
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no The pretty country folk would lie In the springtime, the only proper wedding-time, The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. They wrote this song at that time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, About how life was as short-lived as a flower In the springtime, the only proper wedding time, The time when birds sing, hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. So seize the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, For love is all perfection In the springtime, the only proper wedding time, The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune. 
###FIRST PAGE
No, sir, you’re wrong; we kept the song’s time, we didn’t lose any. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Oh, yes you did—I lost time listening to your foolish song. God be with you, and I hope He fixes your voices! Come on, Audrey. 
##They all exit.
## DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA enter.
###DUKE SENIOR
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised? 
###ORLANDO
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t. I’m afraid of hoping, but I hope anyway. 
## ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHOEBE enter.
###ROSALIND
(as Ganymede) Be patient for a bit longer while I go over the terms of our agreement. (to DUKE SENIOR ) You say that if I bring Rosalind here, you will give her to Orlando in marriage? 
###DUKE SENIOR
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her. 
###ROSALIND
(to ORLANDO ) And you promise to marry her, when I bring her here? 
###ORLANDO
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms. 
###ROSALIND
(to PHOEBE ) And you say you’ll marry me, if I’m willing to marry you? 
###PHOEBE
Yes, even if I die an hour later. 
###ROSALIND
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead? 
###PHOEBE
That’s the deal. 
###ROSALIND
(to SILVIUS ) And you agree to marry Phoebe, if she is willing? 
###SILVIUS
Even if marrying her meant I died. 
###ROSALIND
I’ve promised to make everything right. Duke Senior, keep your promise to give away your daughter. Orlando, keep your promise to marry his daughter. Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me. Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me. I’ll leave now, to set all these things right. 
## ROSALIND and CELIA exit.
###DUKE SENIOR
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter. 
###ORLANDO
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother. But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic. His uncle, who the boy says is a great magician and lives concealed within the boundaries of this forest, taught him. 
## TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY enter.
Well, look: there must be another flood coming, with these couples also on their way to Noah’s ark. Here comes a pair of those strange creatures called “fools” in any language. 
###TOUCHSTONE
Hello, and greetings to you all. 
###JAQUES
My lord, welcome this man. This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest. He swears he used to be a courtier. 
###TOUCHSTONE
If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial. I have danced a round, I have flattered a lady, I have been polite with my friends, smooth and cunning with my enemies. I have bankrupted three tailors. I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight. 
###JAQUES
And how was that one settled? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause. 
###JAQUES
What do you mean, the seventh cause? (to DUKE SENIOR ) My good lord, I hope you like this fellow. 
###DUKE SENIOR
I like him very well. 
###TOUCHSTONE
God bless you, sir. I want the same thing as all these other people. I’ve come here to be married, like all these other would-be couples. This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine. It’s a strange habit of mine to take the thing that no one else wants: virginity in an ugly girl is like a rich man living in a broken-down house or a pearl in the hideous oyster. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings. 
###TOUCHSTONE
His wittiness, a sweet disease, is here one minute and gone the next, sir, as with most fools. 
###JAQUES
But back to that argument you mentioned. What’s the “seventh cause”? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Our argument went through seven stages—watch your posture, Audrey.—It went like this. I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard. He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine. They call this “the courteous retort.” If I repeat that it isn’t cut well, and he responds that he isn’t trying to please me, just himself, with his beard. They call this “ the modest quip.” If I say again it is poorly cut, and he responds that my judgment is no good, they call this “the sullen reply.” If I say yet again that his beard is poorly cut, and he says that I’m not speaking the truth, they call this “the brave retort.” One more time I say it’s not well cut, and he says I’m lying. They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” 
###JAQUES
And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well? 
###TOUCHSTONE
I didn’t dare take it past “the circumstantial lie,” and he didn’t dare go to the “direct lie,” so we compared the lengths of our swords and then ended the fight. 
###JAQUES
Can you name the steps of that argument again? 
###TOUCHSTONE
Of course, sir. There are rulebooks for arguing just as there are rulebooks for manners. Here are the steps. First is “the courteous retort”; second, “the modest quip”; third, “the sullen reply”; fourth, “the valiant retort”; fifth, “the argumentative countercheck”; sixth, “the circumstantial lie”; seventh, “the direct lie.” You can avoid getting to that final stage if you can properly use an “if.” I once heard of an argument that seven judges couldn’t settle. The two parties met up on their own, and one said, “Well, if you said this-and-that, then I must have said such-and-such,” and they shook hands and parted on good terms. “If” is the only peacemaker. “If” is a very valuable word. 
###JAQUES
Isn’t he a remarkable fellow, my lord? He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester. 
###DUKE SENIOR
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit. 
## HYMENHymen is the mythological god of marriage.HYMEN enters with ROSALIND and CELIA, dressed as themselves. Soft music plays.
###HYMEN
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite. 
Good duke, come receive your daughter. Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here. 
###ROSALIND
(to DUKE SENIOR ) I give myself to you, for I am yours.(to ORLANDO ) I give myself to you, for I am yours. 
###DUKE SENIOR
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter. 
###ORLANDO
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind. 
###PHOEBE
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love. 
###ROSALIND
(to DUKE SENIOR ) If you won’t be my father, I won’t have any. (to ORLANDO ) If you won’t be my husband, I won’t have any. (to PHOEBE ) If you won’t be my wife, I won’t have any. 
###HYMEN
Quiet! Stop chattering until I’ve made everything clear. There are eight people here that I will join in marriage, if the truth you see before you pleases you. (to ORLANDO and ROSALIND ) No hardship can part you. (to OLIVER and CELIA ) Your hearts are together. (to PHOEBE ) You must consent to having Silvius as your husband, unless you’d rather be married to a woman. (to TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY ) You are bound to each other as closely as winter is to bad weather. (to all the married couples) While we sing a wedding hymn, satisfy your curiosity with questioning. Your surprise will fade, and you’ll learn how all this came to be. 
(singing) Marriage is the crown Juno wears, It’s a holy bond of domesticity. It’s marriage that populates each town, So marriage should be honored. Honor, honor, and fame Is due to Hymen, the god of every town. 
###DUKE SENIOR
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter. 
###PHOEBE
(to SILVIUS ) I won’t go back on my promise; I’ll marry you. You’ve won me over with your faith. 
## JAQUES DE BOYS enters.
###JAQUES DE BOYS
Let me have your attention for a moment. I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news. When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother. But just at the edge of the forest, he met an old religious man. He spoke with him for a while and decided not only to abandon his pursuit of his brother but even to retreat from the world. He’s giving the throne to his banished brother and restoring all the men he’d exiled to their rightful lands. I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Welcome, young man: you bring a great present to your brothers' wedding. To Oliver, you return his lands; to Orlando, you give a whole dukedom, since he will inherit my land. But first, let’s finish the things we started out here. Then I’ll share the abundance of my returned fortune with all those that have stayed out here with me, according to the rank and status each of you enjoy. But until then, let’s forget our nobility and enjoy some fun. Music, please. Brides and bridegrooms, dance your happiness away. 
###JAQUES
Wait a minute, sir. Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk? 
###JAQUES DE BOYS
Yes, he has. 
###JAQUES
I will go find him. There is much to be learned from these converts. (to DUKE SENIOR ) I bestow on you your former honor, for your patience and virtue. (to ORLANDO ) I give you the love that your faithfulness deserves (to OLIVER ) and you your land, your love, and your great allies. (to SILVIUS ) You get a long and well-deserved stay in bed, with your new wife. 
(to TOUCHSTONE) And you I expect to be up fighting soon. The honeymoon will last two months, tops.— And with that, you may all return to your dancing. I’m bound for another fate. 
###DUKE SENIOR
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit. 
###JAQUES
No, this fun is not for me. I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me. 
##He exits.
###DUKE SENIOR
Let’s proceed. We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight. 
##Everyone dances.
##Everyone exits except ROSALIND.
###ROSALIND
You don’t usually see a woman deliver an epilogue, but it’s no worse than seeing a man deliver the prologue. If it’s true that you don’t need ivy to sell good wine, then it should also be true that a good play doesn’t need an epilogue. But they use good-quality ivy to sell good wine, and a good play is improved by a good epilogue. But then I’m in a strange position, as I not only do not have a good epilogue, I’m not sure this was a good play. I’m not dressed like a beggar, so it wouldn’t be becoming for me to beg. No, instead I’ll bewitch you, and I’ll start with the women. Women, in the name of the love you have for men, I demand that you like as much of this play as you feel like. Men, in the name of the women you love—and I can guess by your goofy smiles that none of you exactly hates them—the play will act as a nice toy for you and the ladies to share. If I actually were a woman, I’d kiss all of you that have beards that pleased me, complexions that I liked, and breath that wasn’t foul. And I’m sure that all of you with nice beards, good faces, and sweet breath will, when I curtsy good night, give me a nice round of applause. 
##She exits.

## DEMETRIUS and PHILO enter.
###PHILO
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control. His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops. Now his eyes devote themselves exclusively to a certain brown-skinned face. His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore. 
##A trumpet fanfareImportant people had their own signature trumpet flourish that announced their entrances to and exits from a room or space. Trumpeters were part of their entourage.trumpet fanfare announces the entrance of ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her ladies and attendants, and eunuchs with fans.
Look at them. Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester. Look and see. 
###CLEOPATRA
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much. 
###ANTONY
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated. 
###CLEOPATRA
I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches. 
###ANTONY
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
I have news from Rome, my good lord. 
###ANTONY
Which irritaties me. Give me a summary. 
###CLEOPATRA
No, listen to it, Antony. Perhaps Fulvia is angry with you. Who knows, maybe the baby-faced Caesar has orders for you: “Do this, do that; conquer that kingdom, liberate this one. Do it or we’ll condemn you.” 
###ANTONY
What, my love? 
###CLEOPATRA
Maybe? No, most likely. You can’t stay here any longer. Caesar has sent your dismissal, so pay attention, Antony. Where’s Fulvia’s summons—excuse me, I should have said Caesar’s. Or do Fulvia and Caesar both beckon you back to Rome? Call in the messengers and we’ll find out. As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant. Or that that bitch Fulvia still has the power to humiliate you. Call the messengers! 
###ANTONY
Let Rome be washed away in the Tiber and let the great empire fall. My place is here. Kingdoms are only dirt. The soil feeds animals as well as people, so how does having a kingdom separate humans from beasts? The noblest thing is to do what we’re doing, particularly when the couple is as well matched as we are. I demand that the world admit we are the perfect couple or else suffer the consequences. 
###CLEOPATRA
(to herself) What an enormous lie! Why did he marry Fulvia if he didn’t love her? I’ll pretend to be a fool and believe him. He’ll never change. 
###ANTONY
(overhearing the last sentence) Unless he is moved and inspired by Cleopatra. Now, since we love the feeling of being in love, let’s not spoil the mood with serious discussion. We shouldn’t spend a minute without some kind of amusement. What shall we do tonight? 
###CLEOPATRA
Meet with the ambassadors. 
###ANTONY
, MESSENGER
Shame on you, stubborn Queen! Everything you do is attractive—scolding, laughing, crying—every emotion seems admirable when you express it. I won’t see any messengers but yours. Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people. Come, my Queen. That’s what you wanted to do last night. (to the ) Don’t talk to us. 
## ANTONY and CLEOPATRA exit with their attendants. 
###DEMETRIUS
Does Antony have so little respect for Caesar? 
###PHILO
Sir, sometimes he’s like a different person, a person who can’t measure up to the former Antony. 
###DEMETRIUS
I’m sad to say this confirms the stories being told about him in Rome, which I had taken to be lies. Well, I’ll hope things change for the better soon. Have a good night! 
##They exit.
## ENOBARBUS, LAMPRIUS, the FORTUNETELLER, Rannius, LUCILLUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, MARDIAN the eunuch, and ALEXAS enter.
###CHARMIAN
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen? Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife! 
###ALEXAS
(calling) Fortuneteller! 
###FORTUNETELLER
What can I do for you? 
###CHARMIAN
, ALEXAS
, FORTUNETELLER
(to ) Is this the man you recommended? (to the ) Are you the man who knows the future? 
###FORTUNETELLER
I can understand a few of nature’s infinite secrets. 
###ALEXAS
, CHARMIAN
(to ) Give him your hand to read. 
###ENOBARBUS
(to the servants) Bring the dessert in right away, and make sure there’s enough wine to toast Cleopatra’s health. 
###CHARMIAN
, FORTUNETELLER
(giving her hand to the ) Kind sir, give me a good fortune. 
###FORTUNETELLER
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them. 
###CHARMIAN
Then see a good one for me. 
###FORTUNETELLER
Your beauty will be even greater than it is now. 
###CHARMIAN
(to the others) He means I’ll get fat. 
###IRAS
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old. 
###CHARMIAN
May my wrinkles forbid that! 
###ALEXAS
Don’t joke about his predictions. Pay attention. 
###CHARMIAN
Quiet! 
###FORTUNETELLER
You will love more than you are loved. 
###CHARMIAN
I would rather get passion from drink than from love. 
###ALEXAS
Just listen to him. 
###CHARMIAN
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune. Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them. Tell me I’ll have a child when I’m fifty who will be honored even by Herod of Judea. Let me marry Octavius Caesar and become my Queen’s equal. 
###FORTUNETELLER
You will outlive the Queen. 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, excellent! I love long life better than figs. 
###FORTUNETELLER
You have already had better fortune than the future will bring. 
###CHARMIAN
Then my children will probably be illegitimate. Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have? 
###FORTUNETELLER
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children. 
###CHARMIAN
Get out of here, you fool! Since you’re a fortuneteller I won’t bring charges of witchcraft against you. 
###ALEXAS
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish. 
###CHARMIAN
, FORTUNETELLER
(to ) Never mind. Tell Iras’s fortune. 
###ALEXAS
We’ll all want our fortune told. 
###ENOBARBUS
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed. 
###IRAS
, FORTUNETELLER
(giving her hand to the ) There’s a palm that will predict a chaste life, if nothing else. 
###CHARMIAN
Like the overflowing Nile predicts famine. 
###IRAS
Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper. You can’t see the future. 
###CHARMIAN
, FORTUNETELLER
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear. (to ) Please, tell her an ordinary fortune. 
###FORTUNETELLER
Your fortunes are the same. 
###IRAS
But how? How is that possible? Give me details. 
###FORTUNETELLER
I’ve said what I have to say. 
###IRAS
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers? By an inch, even? 
###CHARMIAN
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement? 
###IRAS
Not in my husband’s nose. 
###CHARMIAN
, FORTUNETELLER
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts! Alexas! (to the ) Come and tell his fortune. Let him marry a woman he can’t satisfy, dear Isis, I pray! And then let her die, and give him someone worse. Then let her die, and let her replacement be even worse. And so on until the last one, who is unfaithful with at least fifty other men and laughs at him until he dies. I beg you to grant my prayer, good Isis, even though it means you deny me something more important for myself. Good Isis, I beg you! 
###IRAS
Amen, dear goddess. Listen to our prayer. If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful. Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves. 
###CHARMIAN
Amen. 
###ALEXAS
(to himself) See! If they could make me a cuckold, they’d whore themselves in order to see it done. 
###ENOBARBUS
Quiet! Here comes Antony. 
###CHARMIAN
It’s not him; it’s the Queen. 
## CLEOPATRA enters.
###CLEOPATRA
Have you seen my lord? 
###ENOBARBUS
No, lady. 
###CLEOPATRA
Wasn’t he here? 
###CHARMIAN
No, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
He was in a good mood, and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome. Enobarbus? 
###ENOBARBUS
Madam? 
###CLEOPATRA
Find him and bring him here. Where’s Alexas? 
###ALEXAS
Here, at your service. Here comes my lord. 
## ANTONY and the FIRST MESSENGER enter.
###CLEOPATRA
I won’t see him. Everyone come with me. 
##Everyone follows CLEOPATRA out, leaving ANTONY and the FIRST MESSENGER.
###FIRST MESSENGER
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first. 
###ANTONY
Against my brother Lucius? 
###FIRST MESSENGER
Yes. But that war ended as soon as circumstances made it advisable for them to join together against Caesar. But in their very first battle, Caesar won and drove them out of Italy. 
###ANTONY
Well, give me the worst news. 
###FIRST MESSENGER
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it. 
###ANTONY
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward. Go on. As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done. It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me. 
###FIRST MESSENGER
The news is disturbing. Labienus, with the army he led in Parthia, has conquered all of Asia, all the way to the Euphrates River, including Syria, Lydia, and Ionia, while— 
###ANTONY
“While Antony . . .” is what you want to say. 
###FIRST MESSENGER
Oh, my lord! 
###ANTONY
Speak plainly. Don’t tone down what the people are saying. Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her. Use Fulvia’s abusive language. Freely scold me for my faults with as much severity as an enemy with truth on his side. It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them. 
##A SECOND MESSENGER enters.
Good-bye for a while. 
###FIRST MESSENGER
I’ll be at your service. 
##The FIRST MESSENGER exits.
###ANTONY
What’s the news from Sicyon. Tell me. 
###SECOND MESSENGER
The man from Sicyon— 
###ANTONY
Is he here? 
###SECOND MESSENGER
He’s waiting outside. 
###ANTONY
Have him come in. 
##The SECOND MESSENGER exits.
(to himself) I must break Cleopatra’s powerful hold over me or else I’ll lose myself in foolish infatuation. 
##A THIRD MESSENGER enters with a letter.
What’s your message? 
###THIRD MESSENGER
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead. 
###ANTONY
Where did she die? 
###THIRD MESSENGER
In Sicyon. In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you. 
##He hands the letter to ANTONY.
###ANTONY
Leave me. 
##The THIRD MESSENGER exits.
(to himself) A great spirit has gone from the world! This is what I wanted. Once it’s gone, the very thing we reject becomes what we desire. What’s enjoyable one day becomes the opposite as time rolls around. Now that she’s gone, I want her. Now I would call her back, though I pushed her away. I have to break from this beguiling Queen. The time I’ve wasted here has caused ten thousand more problems than the ones I know about. (calling) Are you there, Enobarbus? 
## ENOBARBUS enters.
###ENOBARBUS
What would you like, sir? 
###ANTONY
I have to leave right away. 
###ENOBARBUS
That will kill our lovers. We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them. If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them. 
###ANTONY
I must be gone. 
###ENOBARBUS
If it’s that important, then let the women die. It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless. If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately. I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason. I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm. 
###ANTONY
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine. 
###ENOBARBUS
Alas, sir, no, her feelings come from pure love, not cleverness. Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods. She has more storms and tempests in her than a weather almanac. Her temper is not a trick or a skill—if it is, she can make it rain as well as Jove. 
###ANTONY
I wish I’d never seen her! 
###ENOBARBUS
Then you’d have missed an amazing piece of work, sir, and your trip would have been poorer for the loss. 
###ANTONY
Fulvia is dead. 
###ENOBARBUS
Pardon me? 
###ANTONY
Fulvia is dead. 
###ENOBARBUS
Fulvia? 
###ANTONY
Dead. 
###ENOBARBUS
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks. When a man’s wife dies, he can be comforted by the knowledge that there are replacements to be found. If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve. But in this way, grief and comfort appear together. The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose. 
###ANTONY
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started. 
###ENOBARBUS
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to. 
###ANTONY
Enough of this frivolous talk. Give our officers notice of our intentions. I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave. Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return. Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar. His fleet controls the sea. Our fickle citizens—who never reward service until that service is over—are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the Great to his son, Sextus. Sextus has great honor and power, and his spirit and energy are even greater, all of which makes him the most formidable soldier in the empire. The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential. There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats. Like horse’s hairs dropped in a bucket of water, they come alive like snakes but as yet they bear no poison. Relay our intentions to the officers who will be in charge of the move. 
###ENOBARBUS
I will. 
##They both exit.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, ALEXAS, and IRAS enter.
###CLEOPATRA
Where is he? 
###CHARMIAN
I haven’t seen him recently. 
###CLEOPATRA
, ALEXAS
(to ) Find out where he is, who’s with him, and what he’s doing. Don’t tell him I sent you. If he’s sad, tell him I’m dancing. If he’s happy, say that I’ve suddenly taken sick. Hurry, and come back. 
## ALEXAS exits.
###CHARMIAN
Madam, I think if you love him so much, you aren’t using the best way to get him to reciprocate. 
###CLEOPATRA
What should I do that I’m not doing? 
###CHARMIAN
Always give him his way. Never contradict him. 
###CLEOPATRA
You advise me like a fool. That’s the way to lose him. 
###CHARMIAN
Don’t push him too far. I wish you’d be patient. We come to hate that which controls us. 
## ANTONY enters.
But here comes Antony. 
###CLEOPATRA
I am sick and sullen. 
###ANTONY
I’m sorry to have to say this— 
###CLEOPATRA
Help me away from here, dear Charmian! I shall faint. I won’t be able to go on this way much longer. Human nature isn’t built to withstand this. 
###ANTONY
Now, my dearest Queen— 
###CLEOPATRA
Please, stand farther away from me. 
###ANTONY
What’s the matter? 
###CLEOPATRA
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news. What, does your wife say you can come home? I wish she’d never let you come. Don’t let her say I kept you. I have no power over you. You belong to her. 
###ANTONY
The gods know— 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been. I knew from the first it would be this way. 
###ANTONY
Cleopatra— 
###CLEOPATRA
How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia? It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart. Such false vows are broken as soon as they are spoken. 
###ANTONY
Most sweet Queen— 
###CLEOPATRA
No, please don’t try to excuse your departure. Just say good-bye and go. When you begged to stay, that was the time for words. You didn’t want to go then! You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows. Then, all my parts seemed angelic to you. My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them. 
###ANTONY
What do you mean, lady? 
###CLEOPATRA
I wish I were as big and strong as you. Then you’d see the courage that lives in the Queen of Egypt. 
###ANTONY
Listen to me, Queen. There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you. My Italy is full of civil war. Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome. When two domestic opponents are equally matched—as we are against Pompey—factions will form on the smallest of pretexts. When a formerly hated man grows powerful, he suddenly finds himself with many supporters. Pompey, who was once condemned, now wields his father’s power, and all the citizens who have grievances against the government are joining him. Pompey’s numbers are steadily growing, and the government is ready to do something desperate. But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead. 
###CLEOPATRA
I may not have outlived the foolishness of my youth, but I’m not that childishly naïve. Is it possible Fulvia is dead? 
###ANTONY
She’s dead, my Queen. 
##He shows her the message.
Look at this. Take your royal time and read about the quarrels she encouraged. And saving the best for last, read when and where she died. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, unfaithful lover! You should be filling vials with your tears. Seeing how you take Fulvia’s death, I can see how you would react to mine. 
###ANTONY
Stop arguing and listen to my plans. Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you. I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant. I will make either peace or war, whichever you prefer. 
###CLEOPATRA
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe. Hurry! No, leave it alone. I waver easily between sickness and health. Just as Antony loves. 
###ANTONY
Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true. It has endured many genuine trials. 
###CLEOPATRA
That’s what Fulvia told me. I beg you, turn away and cry for her. Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit. Good. Now perform a scene for me, using your excellent skills of playacting, and pretend that you’re being honorable and righteous. 
###ANTONY
You’ll make me angry. No more of this. 
###CLEOPATRA
I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now. 
###ANTONY
I swear by my sword— 
###CLEOPATRA
, CHARMIAN
Swear by your shield, too! (to ) He’s getting better, but still it’s not his best. See, Charmian, how well this mighty Roman portrays anger? 
###ANTONY
I’ll leave you, lady. 
###CLEOPATRA
Polite sir, let me say one thing. Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it. Sir, you and I were lovers—no, that’s not it, either. You already know all that. There’s something I’d like to—oh, I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say. Just as Antony has forgotten me. 
###ANTONY
If you weren’t the queen of immaturity, I’d think you were immaturity itself. 
###CLEOPATRA
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me. Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them. Your honor is the reason you are leaving. So I beg you not to listen to my foolishness. May the gods be with you. May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. 
###ANTONY
Let’s go. Come with me. Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you. 
##They exit.
## OCTAVIUS CAESAR enters, reading a letter, with LEPIDUS and their courtiers and attendants.
###CAESAR
Now you’ll see, Lepidus, that I don’t disdain our noble ally because of a personal whim. Here’s the news from Alexandra: Antony fishes, drinks, and celebrates all night. He’s become as frivolous and self-indulgent as Ptolemy’s queen, Cleopatra. He rarely attends to his duties or acknowledges he has partners to be considered. Here’s a man who is the epitome of all the vices known to man. 
###LEPIDUS
I can’t believe there could be enough vice in the world to outshine all the good in him. His faults stand out because they must be compared to all his virtues, like stars that shine brightly against the dark night sky. They’re more likely to be the result of inherited weakness than independent choice. 
###CAESAR
You’re too forgiving. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that it’s not improper to fool around with Ptolemy’s wife, or to trade a kingdom for a joke. That it’s fine to engage in drinking matches with inferiors, or stumble drunkenly through the streets in the middle of the day, or get into fist fights with sweaty servants. Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself. If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business. But he’s wasting time and resources vital to our cause and endangering both his position and ours. He should be chastised, like any boy who knows what’s right but chooses to satisfy his desires regardless. 
##The FIRST MESSENGER enters.
###LEPIDUS
Here’s more news. 
###FIRST MESSENGER
We’ve followed your commands, lord Caesar. You shall have hourly updates regarding the situation at sea. Pompey has a strong navy. All the people who only stayed with you out of fear are gathering at the port to join him, in the opinion he’s been treated unfairly. 
###CAESAR
I should have known it. It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized. People will transfer their support to a strong figure until he becomes their actual leader. Then they will value their former leader, even though the loss of their support has made him powerless. The common crowd changes like the tide, to and fro, serving whoever is on the rise. Their power is worn away by their fickleness. 
##The SECOND MESSENGER enters.
###SECOND MESSENGER
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships. They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them. The young, energetic men are joining Pompey. These pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor, since the simple mention of the name “Pompey” carries as much power as a fleet of troops in battle. 
## SECOND MESSENGER exits.
###CAESAR
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism. When you were defeated at the battle of Modena—where you killed the consuls, Hirtius and Pansa—and then driven away, you had to face hunger and thirst. And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand. You drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse. Though you were used to the finest foods, you didn’t turn up your nose at the bitterest berries on the thorniest bushes. You even ate bark from trees, as deer do in winter. Going over the Alps, you ate strange meat that some men would rather die than consume. And you went through all this—the comparison between then and now shames you—in such a soldier-like way that you didn’t seem to suffer at all. 
###LEPIDUS
It’s too bad. 
###CAESAR
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly. It’s time that we brought our armies into the field. Let’s call a council of war immediately. Pompey is making the most of our absence. 
###LEPIDUS
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war. 
###CAESAR
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime. Good-bye. 
###LEPIDUS
Good-bye, my lord. If you receive any more news, please share it with me. 
###CAESAR
Don’t worry, that goes without saying. 
##They exit.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN enter.
###CLEOPATRA
Charmian! 
###CHARMIAN
Madam? 
###CLEOPATRA
Ah, give me some mandragora to drink. 
###CHARMIAN
Why, madam? 
###CLEOPATRA
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone. 
###CHARMIAN
You think about him too much. 
###CLEOPATRA
That’s treason! 
###CHARMIAN
I hope not, Madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
Eunuch! Mardian! 
###MARDIAN
What can I do for your highness? 
###CLEOPATRA
I don’t want to hear you sing. I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do. It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs. Do you have desires? 
###MARDIAN
Yes, dear madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
Indeed? 
###MARDIAN
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste. But I do have intense passions—and I do think about what Venus did with Mars. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, Charmian, where do you think he is now? Is he standing or sitting? Or is he walking? Or is he on his horse? Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him. Do well, horse. Do you know whom it is you carry? A man who carries responsibility for a third of the world on his shoulders. He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me. I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . . Are you thinking about me? Even though I’ve been darkened by the sun and wrinkled with age? Caesar, with your broad forehead, when you were alive, I was the perfect young consort for a king. And powerful Pompey used to stare at me as if he were frozen in time. 
## ALEXAS enters.
###ALEXAS
Queen of Egypt, greetings! 
###CLEOPATRA
You are nothing like Mark Antony! But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit. How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony? 
###ALEXAS
The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you. 
##He gives CLEOPATRA a pearl.
His speech is stored in my heart. 
###CLEOPATRA
My ear must pull it out. 
###ALEXAS
“Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire. Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply. 
###CLEOPATRA
Was he sad or happy? 
###ALEXAS
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, what an even disposition he has! Observe, observe good Charmian! That’s exactly how he is! Just notice. He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others. He wasn’t merry, because to be merry would indicate that he had forgotten his love in Egypt. He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . . Oh, heavenly mixture! Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . . Did you meet my messengers on your way here? 
###ALEXAS
Yes, madam, twenty different messengers. Why did you send so many? 
###CLEOPATRA
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar. Bring ink and paper, Charmian. Welcome, my good Alexas. Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this? 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, that splendid Caesar! 
###CLEOPATRA
May you choke on any other sentiments like that! Say, “That splendid Antony.” 
###CHARMIAN
The courageous Caesar! 
###CLEOPATRA
By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men. 
###CHARMIAN
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said. 
###CLEOPATRA
, CHARMIAN
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was. (to everyone) But come. (to ) Go get me ink and paper. He shall have different messages every day if I have to depopulate Egypt to send them. 
##They all exit.
## POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS enter, dressed for battle.
###POMPEY
If the great gods are just, they will help the most honest men. 
###MENAS
You should know, noble Pompey, that although the gods may delay action, that doesn’t mean they will necessarily refuse their help. 
###POMPEY
But while we pray and wait for that help, the cause we petition for may be lost. 
###MENAS
Sometimes we don’t know what’s best for us and ask for things that may harm us. In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good. 
###POMPEY
I’ll do well. The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea. My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together. Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war. Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money. Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him. 
###MENAS
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation. They have a massive army. 
###POMPEY
Where did you hear this? It’s not true. 
###MENAS
From Silvius, sir. 
###POMPEY
He’s dreaming. I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return. Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips! Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both. Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery. Keep his brain drunk and his appetite unsatisfied, so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and forgetful of his duties, like the Lethe does. 
## VARRIUS enters.
What’s the news, Varrius? 
###VARRIUS
This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now. In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance. 
###POMPEY
I would have listened to less important news with greater enthusiasm. Menas, I had no idea this amorous glutton would have put on his helmet for such an insignificant war. His military ability is double that of the other two. We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow. 
###MENAS
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion. Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him, as did his brother, though I don’t think Antony instigated it. 
###POMPEY
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones. If it weren’t for the fact that we oppose all three of them together, they’d be fighting each other. They certainly have enough provocation. But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their petty differences, though how that will work out, we cannot say. It will be as the gods see fit. In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible. Let’s go, Menas. 
##They exit.
## ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS enter.
###LEPIDUS
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly. 
###ENOBARBUS
I will advise him to speak as he usually does. If Caesar makes him mad, let Antony stand tall and speak as loudly as Mars, the god of war. By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today. I’d leave it long and dare Caesar to insult me by pulling on it, just so I could fight him. 
###LEPIDUS
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances. 
###ENOBARBUS
It’s always appropriate to deal with matters as they arise. 
###LEPIDUS
But major issues must come before minor ones. 
###ENOBARBUS
Not if the minor ones come up first. 
###LEPIDUS
You speak out of passion, but I beg you not to stir things up. Here comes the noble Antony. 
## ANTONY and VENTIDIUS enter.
###ENOBARBUS
And there comes Caesar. 
## CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA enter from another door.
###ANTONY
, VENTIDIUS
(to ) If we can come to an agreement here, we’ll move on to Parthia. Listen, Ventidius. 
##They talk privately together.
###CAESAR
, MAECENAS
(to ) I don’t know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa. 
###LEPIDUS
, CAESAR
, ANTONY
(to and ) Good friends, the cause that joined us was noble. Don’t let some petty quarrel tear us apart. Let’s discuss this calmly. When we argue our differences with raised voices, we do more harm than good. So I plead with you to use reasonable words as you discuss these unreasonable deeds, and don’t lose your tempers. 
###ANTONY
You’re right. If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this. 
##A trumpet fanfare.
###CAESAR
Welcome to Rome. 
###ANTONY
Thank you. 
###CAESAR
Have a seat. 
###ANTONY
After you. 
###CAESAR
No, after you. 
##They sit.
###ANTONY
I hear you’ve interpreted some of my actions as being improper, when they weren’t improper at all—or if they were, their impropriety didn’t concern you. 
###CAESAR
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all. 
###ANTONY
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you? 
###CAESAR
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt. But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt. 
###ANTONY
How do you mean, “conspired”? 
###CAESAR
You can judge for yourself what I mean. Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name. They said they were acting for you. 
###ANTONY
You’re mistaken. My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion. I talked to some reliable participants in that battle. On the contrary, his fight was with both of us. He rejected my authority as much as yours. Since you and I share a common cause, wouldn’t his actions against you be hostile to me as well? I’ve already sent the proof in my letters. If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse. 
###CAESAR
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses. 
###ANTONY
Not true, not true. You know I would never approve a war against my own cause. As for my wife, if only you had such a wife. It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that. 
###ENOBARBUS
We should all have wives like that. Then the women could go to war with the men. 
###ANTONY
I had no control over her uprisings, Caesar, which arose from her impatience—and were shrewdly undertaken, as well. I’m sorry she caused you so much trouble. But you can’t blame me for her offenses. 
###CAESAR
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria. You put my letters in your pocket without reading them and then mocked my messenger out of the room. 
###ANTONY
Sir, he burst into the room without invitation, just after I had come from an important banquet with three kings. I was not myself, as a result of the wine. The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon. Let’s not fight over this fellow. If we must argue, let us remove him from our arguments.  
###CAESAR
You’ve broken the terms of our sworn agreement. You will never be able to say the same about me. 
###LEPIDUS
Easy, Caesar. 
###ANTONY
No, Lepidus, let him say what’s on his mind. Now he slanders my honor, which is sacred to me. Go on, Caesar. What part of the agreement did I break? 
###CAESAR
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them. You refused me both. 
###ANTONY
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it. Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions. I will apologize as much as is appropriate, but my apology will not diminish my great stature—or if I am denied that honor, I will withhold my military might. The truth is that to get me out of Egypt, Fulvia provoked riots here. And though I am only indirectly the cause of all this trouble, I ask your pardon to the extent that my honor permits me to lower myself in such a situation. 
###LEPIDUS
Spoken like a gentleman. 
###MAECENAS
If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you. 
###LEPIDUS
Well put, Maecenas. 
###ENOBARBUS
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished. You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do. 
###ANTONY
You are only a soldier. Be quiet. 
###ENOBARBUS
Oh, I’d forgotten that no one’s supposed to speak the truth. 
###ANTONY
It’s not appropriate for a soldier to be part of a discussion among noblemen. Don’t speak any further. 
###ENOBARBUS
As you please. I’ll pretend to be a conscious stone, and think without speaking. 
###CAESAR
I agree with what he says, though I don’t care for the way he says it. It’s not possible for us to be friends anymore. We’re too different, in both our dispositions and actions. But if there were something that could join us together again, I would go to the ends of the world to find it. 
###AGRIPPA
May I speak, Caesar. 
###CAESAR
What is it, Agrippa? 
###AGRIPPA
You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia. Great Mark Antony is a widower now. 
###CAESAR
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa. If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity. 
###ANTONY
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar. Let me hear what Agrippa has to say. 
###AGRIPPA
If Antony were to take Octavia as his wife, you two would be bound in eternal friendship. As brothers, your hearts would be tied together in an unbreakable knot. She is beautiful enough for the best of men. Her virtue and grace are unparalleled. With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear. People would become used to speaking the truth rather than gossip. Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love. Excuse my bluntness. This is not a spur-of-the-moment suggestion. I have been considering this for some time, in my duties to both of you. 
###ANTONY
What do you say, Caesar? 
###CAESAR
I’d rather hear your reaction to this first. 
###ANTONY
If I said to Agrippa, “I agree. Make it happen,” does Agrippa have the power to make it so? 
###CAESAR
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia. 
###ANTONY
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea. Let’s shake on it. If you go through with this plan, from now on we’ll be brothers, and our love for one another will guide our actions. 
###CAESAR
Here’s my hand. 
##They shake hands.
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister. She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts. We’ll never fight again. 
###LEPIDUS
I’m happy to say “amen” to that! 
###ANTONY
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey. He’s shown me unusual deference lately, and I must repay his favors or risk a reputation for ingratitude. That done, I can turn against him. 
###LEPIDUS
There isn’t much time. Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us. 
###ANTONY
Where is he now? 
###CAESAR
Near Mt. Misena. 
###ANTONY
How large is his land army? 
###CAESAR
Large and increasing. But his navy rules the sea. 
###ANTONY
That’s what I hear. I wish we’d had this conversation sooner. Let’s get down to business—and yet, before we get ready for war, let’s take care of that business we just discussed. 
###CAESAR
With pleasure. I’ll introduce you to my sister. Follow me. 
###ANTONY
Come with us, Lepidus. 
###LEPIDUS
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away. 
##Trumpets play a fanfare. Everyone exits except ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS.
###MAECENAS
, ENOBARBUS
(to ) Welcome back from Egypt, sir. 
###ENOBARBUS
You’ve become Caesar’s right hand man, Maecenas! It’s good to see you too, Agrippa. 
###AGRIPPA
Good Enobarbus! 
###MAECENAS
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably. And I see you survived your time in Egypt. 
###ENOBARBUS
Yes, sir, it was tough. We confused the daytime by sleeping through it, and made the night merry with our drinking. 
###MAECENAS
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people! Is that true? 
###ENOBARBUS
That was nothing. There were many even more memorable feasts. 
###MAECENAS
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed. 
###ENOBARBUS
From the first time Antony saw her, sailing on her barge on the Cydnus River, he was hers. 
###AGRIPPA
She made quite an appearance there, or else my informant invented a very flattering description of her. 
###ENOBARBUS
I’ll tell you. Her barge looked like a golden throne upon the waves, burning bright with the sun’s reflections. The rear deck was covered with hammered gold. The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love. The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music. As the oars beat the water, the waves seemed to speed up as if excited by lust. Cleopatra’s appearance was indescribable. As she reclined under a canopy woven from gold thread, she was more beautiful than any artist’s idealized portrait of the goddess Venus. Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did. 
###AGRIPPA
How excellent for Antony! 
###ENOBARBUS
Her ladies-in-waiting—like Nereides, or mermaids—tended to Cleopatra as she watched them, and their graceful movements added to the beauty of the scene. It seemed as if a mermaid were steering. The silken sails and ropes swelled in the wind, expertly handled by the ladies’ soft hands. People on the wharves could smell exotic perfume wafting from the barge as it passed them. All the people came out to see her, and Antony, waiting for her in the marketplace, was left alone. Even the air itself would have gone to look at Cleopatra, if that wouldn’t have caused an unnatural vacuum in the atmosphere. 
###AGRIPPA
Extraordinary Egyptian! 
###ENOBARBUS
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper. She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead. Our courteous Antony, who has never said “no” to any woman, after spending plenty of time being groomed by the barber, goes to the feast. For that simple meal, he paid with his heart—even though it was only his eyes that were satisfied. 
###AGRIPPA
Royal seductress! She lured Julius Caesar into her bed, he made love to her, and she bore his child. 
###ENOBARBUS
I saw her once hop forty feet down the street. When she stopped she was so out of breath that she was panting. Her beauty made even that weakness seem perfect, and even in her breathlessness she seemed to pour out breath. 
###MAECENAS
Now Antony has to leave her completely. 
###ENOBARBUS
He’ll never leave her. Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring. With other women, the more familiar you grow with them the less appealing they become. Cleopatra, on the other hand, makes you desire her the more you see her. Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut. 
###MAECENAS
If beauty, wisdom, and modesty can settle Antony’s restless heart, Octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him. 
###AGRIPPA
Let’s go. Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here. 
###ENOBARBUS
I humbly thank you. 
##They exit.
## ANTONY and CAESAR enter with OCTAVIA between them.
###ANTONY
, OCTAVIA
(to ) There will be times when my duties and responsibilities take me away from you. 
###OCTAVIA
And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you. 
###ANTONY
, CAESAR
, CAESAR
(to ) Good night, sir. My Octavia, don’t believe everything you hear about me. I haven’t always lived a conventional life, but the future will be by the book. Good night, dear lady. (to ) Good night, sir. 
###CAESAR
Good night. 
## CAESAR and OCTAVIA exit.
##The FORTUNETELLER enters.
###ANTONY
Now, sirrah, I hear you wish you were back in Egypt. 
###FORTUNETELLER
I wish I had never left Egypt and that you had never come to Egypt. 
###ANTONY
Tell me why, if you can. 
###FORTUNETELLER
It’s a feeling, but nothing I can put into words. But you had better get back to Egypt again. 
###ANTONY
Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me? 
###FORTUNETELLER
Caesar. So you’d better not stay with him, Antony. Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around. But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened. That’s why there must be space between you. 
###ANTONY
Don’t speak of this again. 
###FORTUNETELLER
To none but you, only to you. You will surely lose any game you play with Caesar. With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds. Your light dulls when he is near. I repeat: your angel is afraid to inspire you when you’re around him, but when he goes away it becomes brilliant again. 
###ANTONY
Leave now. Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him. 
##The FORTUNETELLER exits.
(to himself) I’ll send him to Parthia. Whether he’s truly gifted or just lucky, what the Fortuneteller said is true. Even the dice obey Caesar. When we compete in sports, my skill is defeated by his luck. If we pick numbers in a lottery, he wins. His roosters always beat mine at the cockfights. His quails beat mine, even against the odds, when mine have the advantage. I’ll return to Egypt. Though I’ve made this marriage to keep peace with Caesar, my pleasure remains in the East, with Cleopatra. 
## VENTIDIUS enters.
Come here, Ventidius. You must go to Parthia. Your authorization is ready. Come with me and I’ll get it for you. 
##They exit.
## LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA enter.
###LEPIDUS
Don’t spend any more time here. Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations. 
###AGRIPPA
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye. 
###LEPIDUS
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well. 
###MAECENAS
According to my reckoning, we’ll get to Mt. Misena before you, Lepidus. 
###LEPIDUS
You’re taking a shorter route. My plans take me a roundabout way. You’ll get there two days before me. 
###BOTH
Good luck, sir. 
###LEPIDUS
Farewell. 
##They exit.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS enter.
###CLEOPATRA
Play me some music. Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers. 
###ALL
Musicians, come in! 
## MADRIAN enters.
###CLEOPATRA
Never mind. Let’s play billiards. Play with me, Charmian. 
###CHARMIAN
My arm is sore. You’ll have a better game with Mardian. 
###CLEOPATRA
Playing with a eunuch is the same as playing with a woman. Will you play with me, sir? 
###MARDIAN
I’ll do my best, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
When a person tries in good faith, even if he fails he cannot be blamed. I don’t want to play now. Give me my fishing rod. We’ll go to the river. With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish. My hook will go through their slimy jaws and as I pull them up I’ll imagine each one is Antony. I’ll say, “Aha! I caught you!” 
###CHARMIAN
It was funny when you and Antony bet on who could catch the first fish. You had a diver put a salted fish on his hook. He was so excited as he hurried to pull it in! 
###CLEOPATRA
That time? Oh, there were so many fun times. I would play some trick on him and laugh until he lost his patience. Then, that night, I would laugh with him while we made love until he was patient again. Then by nine in the morning I would have him so drunk I could dress him in my clothes while I wore the sword he used at the famous battle of Philippi. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
Oh! News from Italy! Cram your good news into my ears. It’s been so long since I’ve heard from him. 
###MESSENGER
Madam, madam— 
###CLEOPATRA
Antony’s dead! If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your Queen. If you say he’s healthy and free, I’ll give you money and you may kiss my hand. Kings have trembled to kiss this hand. 
###MESSENGER
Let me say first, madam, that he is well. 
###CLEOPATRA
Well then, here’s more money for you. But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well. If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words. 
###MESSENGER
Good madam, let me speak. 
###CLEOPATRA
All right, I will. But you don’t look as if you bring good news. If Antony is free and healthy, you shouldn’t wear such a sour face while bringing such good news. If he’s not well, you should arrive like a Fury with snakes for hair, not in the shape of a normal man. 
###MESSENGER
Do you want to hear my news? 
###CLEOPATRA
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again. But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls. 
###MESSENGER
Madam, he’s well. 
###CLEOPATRA
That’s well spoken. 
###MESSENGER
And he’s friendly with Caesar. 
###CLEOPATRA
You are an honest man. 
###MESSENGER
Caesar and he are better friends than ever. 
###CLEOPATRA
I’m going to make you a rich man. 
###MESSENGER
But yet, madam— 
###CLEOPATRA
I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it. Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal. Please, my friend, give me all the news, both good and bad, at the same time. You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free. 
###MESSENGER
I didn’t say free, madam. No, I didn’t say that. He’s bound to Octavia. 
###CLEOPATRA
For what favor? 
###MESSENGER
For the favor of sleeping in her bed. 
###CLEOPATRA
I’m sick, Charmian. 
###MESSENGER
He’s married to Octavia, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
May you die of the worst disease! 
##She knocks him down.
###MESSENGER
Good madam, be patient. 
###CLEOPATRA
What did you say to me? 
##She hits him again.
Get out, you horrible bastard, or I’ll gouge out your eyes. I’ll scalp you. 
##She drags him across the stage.
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger. 
###MESSENGER
Gracious madam, I only brought the news. I didn’t make the match. 
###CLEOPATRA
If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich. The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me. And on top of that I’ll give you whatever you ask for. 
###MESSENGER
He’s married, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
Rogue, you’ve lived too long! 
##She draws a knife.
###MESSENGER
No way, then, I’ll run. What’s the matter with you, madam? I haven’t done anything to you. 
##The MESSENGER exits.
###CHARMIAN
Good madam, restrain yourself. The man hasn’t done anything wrong. 
###CLEOPATRA
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster. May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes. Call that servant back. Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him. Call him! 
###CHARMIAN
He’s afraid to come in. 
###CLEOPATRA
I won’t hurt him. My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress. 
##The MESSENGER returns.
Come here, sir. It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news. You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it. 
###MESSENGER
I’ve only done my duty. 
###CLEOPATRA
Is he married? I can’t hate you any more than I already do if you repeat that he is. 
###MESSENGER
He’s married, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
May the gods destroy you! Do you maintain the same story? 
###MESSENGER
Do you want me to lie, madam? 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, I wish you had lied, even if it meant half my kingdom would be submerged and filled with snakes. Go, get out! Even if you were as handsome as Narcissus, your face would be ugly to me. Is he really married? 
###MESSENGER
I beg your highness’ pardon. 
###CLEOPATRA
Is he really married? 
###MESSENGER
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more. It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do. He’s married to Octavia. 
###CLEOPATRA
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk. You didn’t have anything to do with it. Go away. The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me. Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you. 
##The MESSENGER exits.
###CHARMIAN
Be patient, your highness. 
###CLEOPATRA
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar. 
###CHARMIAN
Many times, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
I’m being repaid for that now. Help me out of here. I feel faint. Oh, Iras, Charmian! It doesn’t matter. Good Alexas, go ask that fellow to describe Octavia. How old is she? What kind of disposition does she have? Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair. Bring me his answers quickly. 
## ALEXAS exits.
###MARDIAN
Let Antony be purged from my life forever—but no, don’t let him, Charmian. Even though half of him is like a Gorgon, the other half is like Mars. (to ) Ask Alexas to also ask him how tall she is. Feel sorry for me, Charmian, but don’t talk to me. Help me get to my bedroom. 
##They exit.
##A trumpet fanfare sounds. POMPEY and MENAS enter through one stage door to the music of a drum and a trumpet. CAESAR, LEPIDUS, ANTONY, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA enter through another door, followed by soldiers.
###POMPEY
I have your hostages and you have mine. Let’s talk before we fight. 
###CAESAR
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration. If you’ve had time to think over these points, let us know whether they will relieve your frustration. If yes, then a lot of brave young men can return to Sicily who would otherwise die here. 
###POMPEY
I address the three of you, the sole rulers of this world and the main arbiters of the gods’ will. I don’t know why my father’s death shouldn’t be avenged, since he has a son and friends to do it. You avenged Julius Caesar’s death at Philippi, where his ghost haunted his killer, Brutus. Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar? And why did the honorable, well-intentioned Brutus and the others, men devoted to the ideal of freedom, assassinate Caesar? They didn’t want one man to be king in Rome. And that’s why I’ve built my navy, which is so huge that the weight of the ships makes the sea foam with anger. I will punish Rome for her ingratitude toward my noble father. 
###CAESAR
Take your time. 
###ANTONY
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy. We’ll meet you at sea. You know that on land our army is far greater than yours. 
###POMPEY
Yes, on land you do outnumber me. Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands. But since, like the cuckoo, you don’t build anything for yourself, live in those lands as long as you can. 
###LEPIDUS
To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal? 
###CAESAR
That’s the point. 
###ANTONY
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers. 
###CAESAR
And consider the possible consequences of fighting against us, in the hopes of gaining a greater fortune. 
###POMPEY
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia. In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome. If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented. 
###CAESAR, ANTONY, AND LEPIDUS
That’s our offer. 
###POMPEY
, ANTONY
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer. But Mark Antony made me somewhat angry. (to ) Though it would be nobler to for me not to speak of this good act myself, you should know that when Caesar and your brother were fighting, your mother came to Sicily for refuge. I welcomed her gladly. 
###ANTONY
, POMPEY
(to ) I heard what you did for her, Pompey, and want to give you the many thanks I owe you. 
###POMPEY
Let me shake your hand. 
##They shake hands.
I didn’t think I would see you here. 
###ANTONY
The East is very seductive. I have you to thank for my trip here; I wouldn’t have left Egypt otherwise, and I have benefited from it. 
###CAESAR
, POMPEY
(to ) You’ve changed since the last time I saw you. 
###POMPEY
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. 
###LEPIDUS
It’s good we had this meeting. 
###POMPEY
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus. So we are in agreement. Please have the contract written up so we can all sign it. 
###CAESAR
That’s the next thing on the agenda. 
###POMPEY
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways. Let’s draw lots to see who will host the first one. 
###ANTONY
I’ll give the first one, Pompey. 
###POMPEY
No, Antony. Pick one of these lots. Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best. I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there. 
###ANTONY
You’ve heard a lot. 
###POMPEY
I mean well, sir. 
###ANTONY
I’m sure you do. 
###POMPEY
I’ve heard a lot more. I heard that Apollodorus carried— 
###ENOBARBUS
, POMPEY
(interrupting ) That’s enough of that. Yes, it’s true. 
###POMPEY
What did he carry, please? 
###ENOBARBUS
A certain queen to Caesar, rolled up in a mattress. 
###POMPEY
Now I know who you are. How are you, soldier? 
###ENOBARBUS
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
###POMPEY
Let me shake your hand. I’ve never been your enemy. I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill. 
###ENOBARBUS
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave. 
###POMPEY
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you. I invite you all aboard my ship. After you, my lords? 
###CAESAR, ANTONY, AND LEPIDUS
Show us the way, sir. 
###POMPEY
Come with me. 
##Everyone exits except for ENOBARBUS and MENAS.
###MENAS
, ENOBARBUS
(to himself) Your father would never have agreed to this treaty, Pompey. (to ) You and I have met, sir. 
###ENOBARBUS
I think it was at sea. 
###MENAS
That it was, sir. 
###ENOBARBUS
You’ve done well at sea. 
###MENAS
And you’ve done well on land. 
###ENOBARBUS
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied. 
###MENAS
Neither can my accomplishments at sea. 
###ENOBARBUS
Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea. 
###MENAS
As you were on land. 
###ENOBARBUS
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny. But let’s shake hands, Menas. 
##They shake.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing. 
###MENAS
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do. 
###ENOBARBUS
But no beautiful woman has an honest face. 
###MENAS
That’s no lie. They steal hearts. 
###ENOBARBUS
We came here to fight against you. 
###MENAS
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match. Today Pompey laughs away his fortune. 
###ENOBARBUS
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying. 
###MENAS
That’s the truth, sir. We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here. Is he married to Cleopatra? 
###ENOBARBUS
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia. 
###MENAS
That’s true, sir. She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife. 
###ENOBARBUS
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife. 
###MENAS
Excuse me, sir? 
###ENOBARBUS
It’s true. 
###MENAS
Then Caesar and he will always be united. 
###ENOBARBUS
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that. 
###MENAS
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love. 
###ENOBARBUS
I think so too. But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them. Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition. 
###MENAS
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that? 
###ENOBARBUS
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony. He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish. Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them. Antony will go where his passion is. He only married out of political necessity. 
###MENAS
Then that’s the way it may turn out. Come on, sir, will you come aboard? I want to drink your health. 
###ENOBARBUS
I’ll join you, sir. We did a lot of drinking in Egypt. 
###MENAS
Let’s go. 
##They exit.
##Music plays. Two or three SERVANTS enter with a feast.
###FIRST SERVANT
Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor. Some of them are leaning already. It won’t take much for them to fall over. 
###SECOND SERVANT
Lepidus is red in the face. 
###FIRST SERVANT
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor. 
###SECOND SERVANT
Their various personalities grate on one another. Lepidus cries, “No more arguing!” and then when they agree he resigns himself to drink. 
###FIRST SERVANT
Which goes on to impede his judgment. 
###SECOND SERVANT
That’s what happens when you partner with great men but lack their power. I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift. 
###FIRST SERVANT
To be so unimportant in the company of important men is like having a face without any eyes. 
##A trumpet call sounds. CAESAR, ANTONY, POMPEY, LEPIDUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, and MENAS enter, along with other captains and a BOY.
###ANTONY
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid. They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty. The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest. As the river ebbs, the farmer scatters his seeds on the remaining silt. The harvest comes shortly after that. 
###LEPIDUS
Do you have unusual snakes there? 
###ANTONY
Yes, Lepidus. 
###LEPIDUS
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile. 
###ANTONY
Yes, Lepidus. 
###POMPEY
Let’s have a seat and some wine. A toast to Lepidus! 
##They sit and drink.
###LEPIDUS
I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop. 
###ENOBARBUS
Not until you pass out. I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then. 
###LEPIDUS
No, I certainly won’t stop. I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid. Without doubt I’ve heard that. 
###MENAS
, POMPEY
(aside to ) Pompey, could I have a word with you? 
###POMPEY
, MENAS
(aside to ) Whisper it in my ear. What is it? 
###MENAS
, POMPEY
(whispers in ’s ear) Please, captain, leave the feast and let me speak with you privately. 
###POMPEY
, MENAS
(aside to ) Leave me alone awhile. Where’s the wine for Lepidus? 
###LEPIDUS
What does a crocodile look like? 
###ANTONY
Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width. It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs. It lives on what nourishes it, and when the four elements leave it, its soul moves into another body. 
###LEPIDUS
What color is it? 
###ANTONY
Its own color. 
###LEPIDUS
It’s a strange snake. 
###ANTONY
It is that. And its tears are wet. 
###CAESAR
, ANTONY
(aside to ) Will that description satisfy him? 
###ANTONY
, CAESAR
(aside to ) That last toast Pompey gave him will take care of him, unless he’s a raging glutton. 
## MENAS whispers to POMPEY again.
###POMPEY
, MENAS
(aside to ) Go to hell, sir. Are you still here? Go away! Do what I tell you. Where’s the wine I ordered? 
###MENAS
, POMPEY
(aside to ) If any service I’ve done you deserves a favor, get up from your stool and speak with me. 
###POMPEY
, MENAS
(aside to ) I think you’re crazy! 
##He gets up and walks aside with MENAS.
What is it? 
###MENAS
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny. 
###POMPEY
You’ve served me faithfully. What else can I say? (to the others) Be happy, lords! 
###ANTONY
Stay away from the quicksand of drink, Lepidus: you’re sinking. 
###MENAS
, POMPEY
(to ) Would you like to be king of the entire world? 
###POMPEY
What are you saying? 
###MENAS
Would you like to be king of the entire world? Now I’ve said it twice. 
###POMPEY
How could that happen? 
###MENAS
Just consider it. Though I seem poor, I am the man who will give you the world. 
###POMPEY
Are you drunk? 
###MENAS
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink. You can be the most powerful man on earth if you dare use your power. Both land and sea are yours if you will take them. 
###POMPEY
Tell me how. 
###MENAS
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat. Let me cut the anchor cable. When we are away from land, cut their throats. Everything that belongs to them is yours. 
###POMPEY
Oh, you should have done it without telling me! For me to do such a thing would be dishonorable. For you to do it would be good service. You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around. Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions. If you had acted without my knowledge, I would have approved your action later. But now I must condemn it. Give it up and go drink. 
##He returns to the feast.
###MENAS
(to himself) For this, I’ll never be faithful to your declining fortunes again. A person who wants something but won’t take it when it materializes won’t get the opportunity again. 
###POMPEY
This toast is for Lepidus! 
###ANTONY
(to a servant) Help Lepidus ashore . . . I’ll accept it for him, Pompey. 
###ENOBARBUS
Here’s to you, Menas. 
##They drink.
###MENAS
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus. 
###POMPEY
Fill the cups until they run over. 
###ENOBARBUS
There goes a strong fellow, Menas. 
##He points to the servant carrying LEPIDUS away.
###MENAS
Why do you say that? 
###ENOBARBUS
He carries a third of the world. Can’t you see that? 
###MENAS
Then a third of the world is drunk. I wish it were all drunk. Then everything would go more smoothly. 
###ENOBARBUS
Drink up. Liven up the party. 
###MENAS
All right, then. 
###POMPEY
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet. 
###ANTONY
It’s getting there. Clink your cups together in a toast! Here’s to Caesar. 
###CAESAR
I could do without another toast. It’s unnatural. I keep washing my brain with alcohol, and it keeps getting fouler and more muddled. 
###ANTONY
Live in the moment. 
###CAESAR
I’d prefer to seize the day. But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one. 
###ENOBARBUS
, ANTONY
(to ) Ha! Shall we dance Egyptian bacchanals, my noble emperor, and celebrate our wine? 
###POMPEY
Let’s have one, good soldier. 
###ANTONY
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful. 
###ENOBARBUS
Everyone join hands. Attack our ears with loud music, and I’ll position you for the dance. Then the boy will sing, and every man will sing the chorus at the top of his voice. 
##Music plays. ENOBARBUS places each man in position, hand in hand.
##                                The Song.
###BOY
(singing) Come, you king of the vine, plump Bacchus, with your pink eyes. Our troubles are drowned in your vats. We’ll crown ourselves with wreathes of grapes. 
###ALL
(singing) Give us cups until the world spins! Give us cups until the world spins! 
###CAESAR
, ANTONY
How can you top that? Good night, Pompey. (to ) Dear brother-in-law, let’s leave together. This frivolity isn’t appropriate to the serious purpose that brought us here. Noble lords, let’s say good night. We’ve all gotten red in the face. Even the strong Enobarbus isn’t immune to the effects of wine, and I’m tongue-tied myself. This wild party has almost turned us all into clowns. What more need I say? Good night. Good Antony, shake my hand. 
###POMPEY
We’ll have a rematch at your feast on shore. 
###ANTONY
Yes, we will. Let’s shake on it. 
###POMPEY
Oh, Antony, even if you’ve taken my father’s house, what is that to me? We’re friends! Come, this way to the rowboat. 
###ENOBARBUS
Be careful not to fall in. 
##Everyone exits except MENAS and ENOBARBUS.
Menas, I’m not going back on shore. 
###MENAS
No, come to my cabin. We’ll have the musicians play drums, trumpets, flutes. What do you say? We’ll make Neptune hear us bid a loud good night to these great men. Play and be damned. Play loud! 
##Trumpets and drums play a fanfare.
###ENOBARBUS
Hooray, I say. There’s my hat! 
##He throws his hat in the air.
###MENAS
Hooray! Come on, noble captain. 
##They exit.
##The dead body of Pacorus is carried in, followed by the triumphant entrance of VENTIDIUS, with SILIUS and soldiers.
###VENTIDIUS
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death. Carry King Orodes’ son at the front of our army, so all the Parthians will know—Orodes, Pacorus pays for Marcus Crassus! 
###SILIUS
Noble Ventidius, while your sword is still warm with the blood of slain Parthians, why not finish the job? The Parthians retreat. Go after them. Chase them down if you have to track them through Media, Mesopotamia, or any other places they may go to hide. Then our great general, Antony, will commend you. 
###VENTIDIUS
Oh, Silius, Silius, I’ve done enough. A subordinate may exceed his authority. You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence. Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person. Sossius, an officer that held the same position in Syria as I do here, achieved great distinction very quickly but lost Antony’s support as a result. A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival. Ambition is a good quality in a soldier, but it proves detrimental rather than beneficial when used to surpass his superiors. I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him. And by insulting him, I would lose credit for the good I have done him already. 
###SILIUS
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius. Are you going to write Antony about this? 
###VENTIDIUS
I’ll modestly tell him what I have done in his name—that’s the magical wording these days. I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia. 
###SILIUS
Where’s Antony now? 
###VENTIDIUS
He plans to go to Athens. We must arrive there before him, as quickly as our baggage train will allow us. (to the soldiers) Get a move on! 
##They all exit.
## AGRIPPA enters through one door and ENOBARBUS enters through another.
###AGRIPPA
Did the brothers-in-law leave? 
###ENOBARBUS
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left. Now the three triumvirs are putting their official seals on the treaty. Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome. Caesar is in a sober mood. And Menas reports that Lepidus has been hungover since Pompey’s party. 
###AGRIPPA
That Lepidus is an elegant man. 
###ENOBARBUS
He’s a stylish man. And how he loves Caesar! 
###AGRIPPA
Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony! 
###ENOBARBUS
Caesar? He’s a god of a man. 
###AGRIPPA
Then what’s Antony? A god of a god? 
###ENOBARBUS
Are you talking about Caesar? He’s without equal! 
###AGRIPPA
Oh, Antony! Oh, you phoenix! 
###ENOBARBUS
If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary. 
###AGRIPPA
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments. 
###ENOBARBUS
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony. Oh! No one can describe or fathom Lepidus’ love for Antony! Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it. But when it comes to Caesar, Lepidus’ love approaches the awestruck wonder of a worshipper. 
###AGRIPPA
He loves them both. 
###ENOBARBUS
They are his dung, and he their beetle. 
##Trumpets sound.
So, there’s the signal to ride. Good-bye, noble Agrippa. 
###AGRIPPA
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye. 
## CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA enter.
###ANTONY
You can’t go any further with us, sir. 
###CAESAR
You take an important part of myself with you. Treat it well . . . . Sister, be the kind of wife I hope you will be, and that this great contract rests upon your being . . . Gracious Antony, don’t let my sister, this epitome of virtue that connects us, become the reason we separate. If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her. 
###ANTONY
Don’t insult me with your distrust. 
###CAESAR
I mean what I say. 
###ANTONY
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one. So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support. We’ll leave you here. 
###CAESAR
Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye. I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease. Farewell. 
###OCTAVIA
My noble brother! 
##She begins to cry.
###ANTONY
, OCTAVIA
Her eyes are like April: full of showers. But they’ll flower into love. (to ) Be cheerful. 
###OCTAVIA
, CAESAR
(to ) Take care of my former husband’s property, and— 
###CAESAR
What is it, Octavia? 
###OCTAVIA
I’ll tell you privately. 
##She and CAESAR move apart from the group, and she whispers to him.
###ANTONY
She won’t say what she’s feeling, and she can’t understand her feelings. She’s balanced uneasily, like a feather on the swell of a great wave—she won’t move, even though her situation is about to change. 
###ENOBARBUS
, AGRIPPA
(aside to ) Do you think Caesar will cry? 
###AGRIPPA
, ENOBARBUS
(aside to ) He does look like it. 
###ENOBARBUS
, AGRIPPA
(aside to ) If he were a horse, watery eyes would lower his value. Men aren’t supposed to cry, either. 
###AGRIPPA
, ENOBARBUS
(aside to ) Why, Enobarbus, when Antony saw that Julius Caesar was dead, he cried terribly. And he wept when he found that Brutus had been killed at Philippi. 
###ENOBARBUS
, AGRIPPA
(aside to ) He certainly did have rheumy eyes that year. Whenever he had to kill, he cried—it’s true!—until I cried too. 
###CAESAR
, OCTAVIA
(returning with ) Don’t worry, sweet Octavia, I’ll always write to you, and I’ll think about you all the time. 
###ANTONY
Come here, sir. I’ll wrestle with you out of love. See, now I have you. 
##They embrace.
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods. 
###CAESAR
Good-bye. Be happy. 
###LEPIDUS
, ANTONY
(to ) May every star light your path. 
###CAESAR
Farewell, farewell. 
##He kisses OCTAVIA.
###ANTONY
Farewell. 
##Trumpets sound a fanfare as they exit.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS enter.
###CLEOPATRA
Where is that messenger? 
###ALEXAS
He’s afraid to come in. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir. 
##The MESSENGER enters.
###ALEXAS
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood. 
###CLEOPATRA
, MESSENGER
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off! But now that Antony’s gone, who will do it for me? (to ) Come closer. 
###MESSENGER
Most formidable Queen! 
###CLEOPATRA
Did you see Octavia? 
###MESSENGER
Yes, revered Queen. 
###CLEOPATRA
Where? 
###MESSENGER
In Rome, Madam. I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony. 
###CLEOPATRA
Is she as tall as I am? 
###MESSENGER
She is not, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
Did you hear her speak? Is her voice pitched high or low? 
###MESSENGER
Madam, I heard her speak. She has a low-pitched voice. 
###CLEOPATRA
That’s not in her favor. He can’t like her very long. 
###CHARMIAN
Like her? Oh, Isis, that’s impossible. 
###CLEOPATRA
You’re right, Charmian. She’s both dull-spoken and dwarfishly little.—Did she carry herself with majesty? Compare her to any memory you might have of royalty. 
###MESSENGER
She creeps along. Moving or standing still, her bearing is about the same. She has a body, not a life. She’s more like a statue than a living, breathing human being. 
###CLEOPATRA
Is this true? 
###MESSENGER
If not, then I have no powers of observation. 
###CHARMIAN
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better. 
###CLEOPATRA
He’s very observant. I can tell. She doesn’t have anything going for her so far. This messenger is wise. 
###CHARMIAN
Very wise. 
###CLEOPATRA
, MESSENGER
(to ) How old do you think she is? 
###MESSENGER
She was a widow previously, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
A widow? Do you hear that, Charmian? 
###MESSENGER
And I think she’s at least thirty. 
###CLEOPATRA
Do you remember her face? Was it long or round? 
###MESSENGER
Round enough to be unattractive. 
###CLEOPATRA
Usually that means a person is foolish. What color is her hair? 
###MESSENGER
Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower. 
###CLEOPATRA
Here’s gold for you. You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me. I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome. I find that you’re very good at this kind of work. Go, prepare to travel. My letters are ready to go. 
##The MESSENGER exits.
###CHARMIAN
He’s an admirable man. 
###CLEOPATRA
He certainly is. I’m very sorry I was so hard on him. Why, from what he says, Octavia isn’t worth getting upset over. 
###CHARMIAN
Not a bit, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
This man’s been around royalty. He should recognize it when he sees it. 
###CHARMIAN
Been around royalty! Isis forbid it were otherwise, since he’s been in your service so long. 
###CLEOPATRA
I want to ask him one more thing, Charmian. But it’s not important. Bring him to my writing room. Everything may still be all right. 
###CHARMIAN
I assure you it is, madam. 
##They exit.
## ANTONY and OCTAVIA enter.
###ANTONY
No, no, Octavia, it’s not only that. That would be excusable—that and a thousand other offenses like it. But Caesar has gone and waged a new war against Pompey. He made his will and read it in a public assembly. He hardly refers to me at all, though official decisions are supposed to be made jointly. When he can’t avoid mentioning my services to the state, he minimizes them as much as possible. When situations arise when it would be natural to emphasize my due credit, he either ignores them or only pays me lip service.  
###OCTAVIA
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry. No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree. I’ll be left in the middle, praying for both sides. The good gods will laugh at me when on the one hand I pray for my husband and on the other for my brother. “Let my husband win!” “Let my brother win!” One prayer cancels out the other. There’s no middle ground between these two extremes. 
###ANTONY
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you. If I’m defeated, I lose my reputation. If I lose my reputation, I lose myself. It would be better for you to have no husband than a husband who lacks honor. However, as you requested, you may go and try to negotiate with your brother. In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his. Go as soon as possible, so your prayers may be answered the sooner. 
###OCTAVIA
Thank you, my lord. May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator. A war between you two would split the very world, and the bodies of your slaughtered soldiers would have to fill the chasm between. 
###ANTONY
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them. Our faults can’t be so alike that you would judge us similarly. Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions. Spend as much as you like. 
##They exit.
## ENOBARBUS and EROS enter.
###ENOBARBUS
How goes it, friend Eros? 
###EROS
Some startling news has just arrived, sir. 
###ENOBARBUS
What news, man? 
###EROS
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey. 
###ENOBARBUS
That’s old news. Who’s winning? 
###EROS
Caesar used Lepidus in the war, but as soon as it was over, Lepidus was expelled from the triumvirate. He wasn’t allowed any of the glory of the victory, and he was accused of treasonous correspondence with Pompey. On the basis of Caesar’s accusation alone, Lepidus was imprisoned. So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him. 
###ENOBARBUS
So now the world will only be devoured by two sets of jaws—Caesar’s and Antony’s. And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all. Where’s Antony? 
###EROS
He’s walking in the garden, like this (imitating anger). And he kicks the leaves on the path, exclaiming, “Lepidus, you fool!” Then he threatens to kill the officer who murdered Pompey. 
###ENOBARBUS
Antony’s grand navy is prepared. 
###EROS
To sail to Italy and Caesar. Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now. I should have waited to tell you my news. 
###ENOBARBUS
It won’t be that important. But never mind. Take me to Antony. 
###EROS
Come with me, sir. 
##They exit.
## AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, and CAESAR enter.
###CAESAR
In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all. This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace. Caesarion—whom they call my father’s son—and all their illegitimate children sat at their feet. Antony confirmed her possession of Egypt and made her absolute Queen of lower Syria, Cyprus, and Lydia. 
###MAECENAS
He did this in public? 
###CAESAR
In the public arena, where they perform sporting events. He proclaimed his sons to be kings of kings. He gave Media, Parthia, and Armenia to Alexander. He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy. Cleopatra was dressed like the goddess Isis. They say she often attended her public functions like that. 
###MAECENAS
Let’s send this news to Rome. 
###AGRIPPA
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already. They’ll abandon him completely when they hear this. 
###CAESAR
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations. 
###AGRIPPA
Who does he accuse? 
###CAESAR
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions, which we seized in Sicily. Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me. Finally, he criticizes the deposing of Lepidus, and then goes on to accuse me of keeping all of Lepidus’ property for myself. 
###AGRIPPA
Sir, these accusations should be answered. 
###CAESAR
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way. I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position. For this he deserved to be deposed. As for what I seized in the wars, I granted that Antony should have a share. But I also demanded my share of his acquisitions in Armenia and the other conquered kingdoms. 
###MAECENAS
He’ll never agree to that. 
###CAESAR
Then we won’t agree to his demands. 
## OCTAVIA enters with her attendants.
###OCTAVIA
Greetings, Caesar, my lord! Greetings, dearest Caesar! 
###CAESAR
Oh, to think you’ve been rejected! 
###OCTAVIA
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to. 
###CAESAR
Then why did you travel so quietly? You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister. Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears. The trees along the road should have been filled with eager spectators. Crowds should have been faint with excitement waiting to see you. The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven. But you’ve arrived like a common maid bringing goods to a Roman market. You’ve kept me from displaying my love—and when love is not shown, it’s often not felt. I would have met you by sea and again by land. At each stage of your trip there would have been a more spectacular greeting. 
###OCTAVIA
My good lord, I wasn’t forced to travel like this. It was my choice. Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him. When he gave me this news, I begged him to let me visit you. 
###CAESAR
Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his lust. 
###OCTAVIA
Don’t say that, my lord. 
###CAESAR
I’ve kept track of him, and reports of his affairs arrive on every ship. Where do you think he is now? 
###OCTAVIA
He’s in Athens, my lord. 
###CAESAR
No, he’s not. You’ve been deceived. Cleopatra summoned him. He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war. He’s recruited Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; the King of Pont; Herod, of Judea; Mithridates, King of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, the kings of Mede and Lycaonia, and many more. 
###OCTAVIA
Oh, I’m heartbroken. I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other. 
###CAESAR
You’re welcome here. I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations. Cheer yourself. Don’t be troubled by the present situation, the obligations of which must ruin your happiness. Don’t worry about things that have already been decided by fate. Welcome home to Rome. Nothing is more precious to me than you. You have been unbelievably abused, and now the gods make us the dispensers of justice. Be comforted. You will always be welcome to me. 
###AGRIPPA
Welcome, lady. 
###MAECENAS
Welcome, dear madam. Every heart in Rome loves and pities you. Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us. 
###OCTAVIA
, CAESAR
(to ) Is that true, sir? 
###CAESAR
It’s undeniable. You are welcome here, sister. I beg you to continue to be patient. My dearest sister! 
##They exit.
## CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS enter.
###CLEOPATRA
I’ll be straight with you. Do not doubt it. 
###ENOBARBUS
But why, why, why? 
###CLEOPATRA
You opposed my taking part in the war. You said it wasn’t proper. 
###ENOBARBUS
Well, is it? Is it? 
###CLEOPATRA
Isn’t this war against me? Why shouldn’t I be there in person? 
###ENOBARBUS
Well, I could answer that if we went to war on male and female horses alike—the male horses would be totally distracted and useless. The mares would be ridden by their riders and the male horses. 
###CLEOPATRA
What do you mean? 
###ENOBARBUS
Antony will necessarily be distracted by your presence. You will affect his heart and his head. You’ll take up time he can’t afford to lose. He’s already criticized for frivolous behavior. In Rome they say that your eunuch Photinus and your maids run the war. 
###CLEOPATRA
Let Rome fall! May the tongues of our critics rot! I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man. Don’t argue against it. I won’t stay behind. 
## ANTONY and CANIDIUS enter.
###ENOBARBUS
No, I’ve had my say. Here comes the Emperor. 
###ANTONY
Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet? 
###CLEOPATRA
No one admires speed more than the lazy. 
###ANTONY
That’s a good reprimand, suitable for reminding even the best of men to guard against negligence. Canidius, we’ll fight him at sea. 
###CLEOPATRA
Of course we’ll fight him by sea. What else? 
###CANIDIUS
Why do you want to do that, my lord? 
###ANTONY
Because he’s daring us to do it. 
###ENOBARBUS
So you’ve dared him to single combat. 
###CANIDIUS
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey. But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you. 
###ENOBARBUS
Your ships are not well crewed. Your sailors are mule drivers, harvesters—men who were drafted quickly and have little training. Caesar’s fleet is manned by mariners who already have experience battling Pompey. His ships are maneuverable. Yours are slow and awkward. Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you. You’ve prepared for a land war. 
###ANTONY
I will fight by sea. By sea. 
###ENOBARBUS
Most worthy sir, if you do that you throw away all the advantages you have on land. You will have to divide your army, which mostly consists of battle-hardened foot soldiers. You will be unable to use your legendary battle knowledge. You’ll be abandoning proven methods that promise victory, and instead you’ll put yourself at the mercy of haphazard chance. 
###ANTONY
I’ll fight at sea. 
###CLEOPATRA
I have sixty ships. Caesar doesn’t have any that are better. 
###ANTONY
We’ll burn our surplus ships and fully man the rest. We’ll sail from Actium and beat Caesar as he approaches. Even if we fail at that, we can still fight him on land. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
What’s your business? 
###MESSENGER
The news is true, my lord. Caesar has been seen. He has captured Toryne. 
##He exits.
###ANTONY
Can Caesar be there in person? No, that’s impossible. It’s strange enough that his army should be there. Canidius, take our nineteen legions and twelve thousand horse soldiers. You must hold them on land. We’ll go to our ship. Come away, Cleopatra. 
##A SOLDIER enters.
What’s the news, brave soldier? 
###SOLDIER
Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor! Don’t trust rotten planks. Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds? Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming. We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe. 
###ANTONY
Well, well, let’s go. 
## ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS exit.
###SOLDIER
By Hercules, I think I’m right. 
###CANIDIUS
Soldier, you are. But Antony’s decisions aren’t coming from his extensive experience. Our leader is being led. We are following a woman. 
###SOLDIER
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you? 
###CANIDIUS
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land. Caesar’s speed defies belief. 
###SOLDIER
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled. 
###CANIDIUS
Who’s his lieutenant, do you know? 
###SOLDIER
A man named Taurus, they say. 
###CANIDIUS
I know the man well. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
The Emperor is calling for Canidius. 
###CANIDIUS
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news. 
##They exit.
## CAESAR enters with TAURUS and his army.
###CAESAR
Taurus! 
###TAURUS
My lord? 
###CAESAR
Don’t attack by land. Keep the army together. Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea. Don’t exceed your orders as written here. 
##He hands TAURUS a scroll.
Our fate depends on this chance. 
##They exit.
## ANTONY and ENOBARBUS enter.
###ANTONY
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy. From there we’ll be able to see how many ships he has and plan accordingly. 
##They exit.
## CANIDIUS and his army marches one way across the stage while CAESAR’s lieutenant, TAURUS, marches across the other way. After the two armies march off stage, the noise of a battle at sea is heard.
##Trumpets sound a retreat. ENOBARBUS enters.
###ENOBARBUS
We’re ruined, ruined, ruined! I can’t watch any more. The Egyptian flagship, the Antoniad, followed by all sixty Egyptian ships, has turned and fled. It destroyed my eyes to look upon it. 
## SCARUS enters.
###SCARUS
Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them! 
###ENOBARBUS
What’s wrong with you? 
###SCARUS
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness. We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces. 
###ENOBARBUS
How goes the battle? 
###SCARUS
Our side shows all the signs of certain defeat, which appear like the symptomatic sores of the plague. Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled. 
###ENOBARBUS
I saw that. The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more. 
###SCARUS
Once she had turned around, the noble Antony, ruined by love, hoisted his own sails and followed her like a lovesick duck. He left the battle at the most crucial point. I never saw such a shameful act. He betrayed his own experience, manhood, and honor. 
###ENOBARBUS
Terrible. Terrible. 
## CANIDIUS enters.
###CANIDIUS
The battle on the sea is almost lost. If our general had been his old self, we would have won. Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own. 
###ENOBARBUS
Are you considering desertion, as well? Then everything must really be finished. 
###CANIDIUS
They fled toward Peloponnesus. 
###SCARUS
It’s easy to get there. I’ll go there and ascertain their next move. 
##He exits.
###CANIDIUS
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar. In this, I follow the examples of the six kings who have already surrendered. 
##He exits.
###ENOBARBUS
I’ll still follow Antony, even though the odds are against him and good sense tells me I should go the other way. 
##He exits.
## ANTONY enters with attendants.
###ANTONY
Listen. The earth tells me to stop walking upon it, as it’s ashamed to carry me. Friends, come here. I’m completely lost. I have a ship full of treasure. Take that. Divide it. Escape and make peace with Caesar. 
###ALL
Flee? Not us. 
###ANTONY
I have already fled from my true self. I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run. Friends, go. I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance. Leave. My treasure’s in the harbor; take it. Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now! Even my hair revolts. The white hairs blame the brown hairs for being irresponsible, and the brown ones blame the white ones for being spineless and foolish. Friends, go. I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you. Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are. Take your cues from my own despair. Abandon the person that has abandoned himself. Go to the harbor immediately! I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure. Just give me a moment, please—only a moment. I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long. 
##The attendants exit. ANTONY sits.
## CHARMIAN, IRAS, and EROS enter, supporting CLEOPATRA.
###EROS
No, gentle madam, go. Comfort him. 
###IRAS
Yes, do, dearest Queen. 
###CHARMIAN
Of course you must comfort him! What else? 
###CLEOPATRA
Let me sit down. Oh, Juno! 
##She sits.
###ANTONY
, CLEOPATRA
(seeing ) No, no, no, no, no. 
###EROS
Do you see her, sir? 
###ANTONY
Oh, damn, damn, damn! 
###CHARMIAN
Madam! 
###IRAS
Madam, oh, good Empress! 
###EROS
Sir . . . sir . . . 
###ANTONY
(to himself) Yes, my lord, that’s true. At Philippi, Caesar kept his sword in its sheath, like a dancer, while I commanded the armies that conquered Cassius and Brutus. Caesar fought only through lieutenants. He had no experience with the brave contests of war. But now . . . never mind. 
###CLEOPATRA
Ah, give us some privacy. 
###EROS
The Queen is here, my lord. 
###IRAS
Go to him, madam, speak to him. He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed. 
###CLEOPATRA
Well, then, help me. 
##Her attendants help her to stand.
###EROS
Most noble sir, stand up. The Queen is coming. She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her. 
###ANTONY
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error. 
###EROS
Sir, here’s the Queen. 
###ANTONY
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt? See how I hide my shame from you by turning around? I look behind me to see my past, destroyed by dishonor. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic! I didn’t think you would follow me. 
###ANTONY
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you. You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, forgive me! 
###ANTONY
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man. I’ve done as I pleased with half the world, making and losing fortunes, but now I negotiate from a position of weakness. You knew how far you had conquered my spirit. You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what. 
###CLEOPATRA
Forgive me! Forgive me! 
###ANTONY
Don’t shed even one tear. One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost. Give me a kiss. 
##They kiss.
This repays me. I sent our children’s schoolmaster to Caesar with our offer. Has he returned? Love, I am full of heaviness. (calling) Servants, bring some wine and food! We have the most contempt for fortune when it goes against us. 
##They exit.
## CAESAR, AGRIPPA, THIDIAS, and DOLABELLA enter, with others of the court.
###CAESAR
Let the envoy from Antony come in. Do you know him? 
###DOLABELLA
It’s Antony’s schoolmaster. By sending such an insignificant emissary, Antony shows us how low he has sunk. Not so long ago, he had so many royal supporters that he sent along extra kings as messengers. 
##Antony’s AMBASSADOR enters.
###CAESAR
Come forward and speak. 
###AMBASSADOR
Humble as I am, I represent Antony. Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean. 
###CAESAR
So be it. Say what you’re here for. 
###AMBASSADOR
He acknowledges that you are the master of his fate, and he requests to be allowed to live in Egypt. If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens. That’s all he asks for himself. Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority. She only asks that the crown of Egypt pass to her heirs, who are now at your mercy. 
###CAESAR
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests. I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him. Then I’ll listen to her. Give my answer to them both. 
###AMBASSADOR
May good luck follow you! 
###CAESAR
Take him safely through the lines. 
##The AMBASSADOR exits.
###THIDIAS
(to ) Now it’s time to test your eloquence. On your way. Separate Cleopatra from Antony. In my name, promise to fulfill her petitions. You can make up additional offers, if necessary. Women aren’t strong, even at their best. Hardship will make even a vestal abandon her vows. Use your ingenuity, Thidias. You can make your own conditions, which I will authorize as law. 
###THIDIAS
I go, Caesar. 
###CAESAR
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions. 
###THIDIAS
I will, Caesar. 
##They exit.
## CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS enter.
###CLEOPATRA
What are we going to do, Enobarbus? 
###ENOBARBUS
Think about our situation, then die. 
###CLEOPATRA
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I? 
###ENOBARBUS
Only Antony was at fault. He put his desire in charge of his reason. So what if you ran from the battle, terrified, as ranks of ships threatened one another? Why should he have followed you? With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him. To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss. 
###CLEOPATRA
Please, let’s not talk about it. 
##The AMBASSADOR and ANTONY enter.
###ANTONY
Is that his answer? 
###AMBASSADOR
Yes, my lord. 
###ANTONY
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up? 
###AMBASSADOR
That’s what he says. 
###ANTONY
, CLEOPATRA
Tell her. (to ) If you send my aged head to that boy, Caesar, he’ll give you all the kingdoms you want. 
###CLEOPATRA
Your head, my lord? 
###ANTONY
, AMBASSADOR
(to the ) Go back to him. Tell him that his cheeks still bear the pink flush of youth, and that the world expects to see something remarkable from him. His treasure, his navy, and his armies might belong to a coward, and his ministers might be able to succeed just as well on behalf of a child as under the command of Caesar. Therefore, I dare him to lay aside his fancy trappings and meet this old man in single combat, sword against sword, just the two of us. I’ll write the challenge. Follow me. 
## ANTONY and the AMBASSADOR exit.
###ENOBARBUS
(aside) Oh, that’s likely! Caesar, the great commander of troops, will surely risk all he has gained in order to fight this gladiator in the public square! I see that men’s judgments are tied to their fortunes, and that external factors influence a man’s internal qualities, making everything suffer. How could Antony, knowing how luck stood on either side, still imagine that Caesar would respond to his nonsense! Caesar, you’ve conquered his judgment too. 
##A SERVANT enters.
###SERVANT
A messenger has arrived from Caesar. 
###CLEOPATRA
With no more ceremony than that? See, ladies, how they scorn me now. They pinch their noses to avoid smelling the dying rose whose scent, as a bud, they happily inhaled. Show him in, sir. 
##The SERVANT exits.
###ENOBARBUS
(aside) My integrity and I begin to contradict each other. Being loyal to a fool makes loyalty foolish. But a person who can bear to keep his allegiance to a defeated lord defeats his lord’s conqueror and earns a place in history. 
## THIDIAS enters.
###CLEOPATRA
What does Caesar want? 
###THIDIAS
It is for your ears only. 
###CLEOPATRA
There are only friends here. Speak confidently. 
###THIDIAS
So they are possibly Antony’s friends. 
###ENOBARBUS
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has. If he had that many friends, then he wouldn’t need us. If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend. As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s. 
###THIDIAS
So be it. This, then, this is the message Caesar sends to you, famous Queen: he implores you not to be concerned about your situation. Just remember that he is Caesar. 
###CLEOPATRA
Respectfully put. Go on. 
###THIDIAS
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh! 
###THIDIAS
So he regrets that any dishonorable acts were forced on you, not being performed of your own free will. 
###CLEOPATRA
He is like a god and knows the truth. My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated. 
###ENOBARBUS
(aside) I’ll go get the truth of this from Antony. Sir, sir, are you so badly off that we must abandon you to your fate? Even your dearest friend has abandoned you. 
## ENOBARBUS exits.
###THIDIAS
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him? He almost begs for the opportunity to help you. It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you. But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection. 
###CLEOPATRA
What’s your name? 
###THIDIAS
My name is Thidias. 
###CLEOPATRA
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand. Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him. Tell him—whose decrees are obeyed by the whole world—that I will accept the fate he chooses for Egypt. 
###THIDIAS
That’s your most dignified course of action. When confronted with the choice between a prudent action and a risky one, a wise man should dare to do only what he can practically accomplish—if he follows this course, he will never be subjected to unpredictable chance. Allow me to pay my respects by kissing your hand. 
##He kisses her hand.
###CLEOPATRA
When Octavius Caesar’s father thought about conquering kingdoms, he rained kisses on my unworthy hand. 
## ANTONY and ENOBARBUS enter.
###ANTONY
Promising favors? By Jove that thunders! Who are you, slave? 
###THIDIAS
A person who merely follows the orders of the best man, the man most worthy of service. 
###ENOBARBUS
You will be whipped. 
###ANTONY
, THIDIAS
(calling for servants) Come here! (to ) Ah, you bird of prey! Now by all the gods and devils, my authority weakens. Not long ago, when I cried, “Ho!” kings would jump up and cry, “What’s your pleasure?” (calling to servants) Are you deaf? I’m still Antony. 
##A SERVANT enters, followed by others.
Take away this lout and whip him. 
###ENOBARBUS
(aside) It’s safer to toy with a lion cub than an old, dying lion. 
###ANTONY
By the moon and stars! Whip him! If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now? This woman who once was Cleopatra, but now has become something different? Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy! Take him away. 
###THIDIAS
Mark Antony— 
###ANTONY
Pull him away, and once he has been whipped, bring him back. Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us. 
##The SERVANTS exit with THIDIAS.
###CLEOPATRA
(to ) You were damaged goods before I met you. Ha! Did I desert my bed in Rome, passing up the chance to have a legitimate family with a jewel of a woman, in order to be deceived by one who wastes her favors on servants? 
###CLEOPATRA
My good lord— 
###ANTONY
You’ve always been a liar. But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin. 
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, has it come to this? 
###ANTONY
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you. No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip. For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand. 
###CLEOPATRA
Why are you doing this? 
###ANTONY
To let a servant be familiar with my little toy, your hand—a hand that has signed royal treaties and pledged your love to me—oh, if only I were standing on the hill of Basan, so that I could roar louder than that horned herd! For I have been savagely abused, and to state my grievances politely would be as absurd as a condemned criminal thanking the hangman for doing his job quickly. 
##A SERVANT enters with THIDIAS.
Has he been whipped? 
###SERVANT
Soundly, my lord. 
###ANTONY
Did he cry? Did he beg my pardon? 
###SERVANT
He did ask for mercy. 
###ANTONY
, THIDIAS
(to ) If your father is alive, let him be sorry you weren’t born a daughter. And you should be sorry to follow Caesar in his triumphal parade, since you have been whipped for following him. From now on, you should tremble and grow feverish whenever you see the white hand of a lady. Get yourself back to Caesar. Tell him how you’ve been treated. Be sure you tell him he makes me angry with him, because he seems proud and disdainful, harping on what I am now rather than what he knows. He makes me angry—and that’s easy to do right now, now that my lucky stars have abandoned me. If he doesn’t like what I’ve said or done, remind him that he holds Hipparchus, a slave I freed. He may whip, or hang, or torture him as he pleases. Then we will be even. Recommend that to him. Take your whipping scars and go. 
## THIDIAS exits.
###CLEOPATRA
Are you done yet? 
###ANTONY
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin. 
###CLEOPATRA
(aside) I must wait for him to finish his tirade. 
###ANTONY
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants? 
###CLEOPATRA
Don’t you know me still? 
###ANTONY
Has your heart cooled toward me? 
###CLEOPATRA
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat. As it dissolves, so shall my life. The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies. 
###ANTONY
I am satisfied. Caesar has made camp in Alexandria. I will fight him there. Our land forces have bravely stood firm. Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself. Where have you been, my bravery? Do you hear what I say, lady? If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be covered in blood. My sword and I will earn our place in history. We still have hope. 
###CLEOPATRA
That’s my brave lord! 
###ANTONY
I’ll be triple the soldier I was in strength, bravery, and stamina. I’ll fight brutally. In the days when I had better luck, prisoners of war could buy their freedoms from me with simple trinkets. But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me. Come, let’s have one more extravagant night. Invite all my sad captains. Fill our wine bowls again. Let’s drink through midnight. 
###CLEOPATRA
It’s my birthday. I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again. 
###ANTONY
We’ll win yet. 
###CLEOPATRA
, ENOBARBUS
(to ) Call all my lord’s noble captains to him. 
###ANTONY
Do so. I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds. Come on, my Queen. There’s still life in our cause. The next time I fight, I’ll make Death love me. I’ll compete even with his fatal scythe. 
##Everyone except ENOBARBUS exits.
###ENOBARBUS
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury. Rage scares away a man’s fear. In that state, a dove will attack an ostrich. I have always noticed that when my captain’s reason is diminished, his bravery increases. When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon. I’ll look for some way to leave his service. 
##He exits.
## CAESAR enters, reading a letter, with AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, and his army.
###CAESAR
He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt. He whipped my messenger with rods. He dares me to personal combat, Caesar against Antony. Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge. 
###MAECENAS
Caesar must realize that when a man as powerful as Antony begins to rage, he has been pursued to the point of collapse. Don’t give him time to catch his breath. Take advantage of his unreasonable rage. Anger does not protect the angry well. 
###CAESAR
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight. Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him. See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers. We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it. Poor Antony! 
##They exit.
## ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS enter, with attendants.
###ANTONY
He won’t fight with me, Domitius? 
###ENOBARBUS
No. 
###ANTONY
Why won’t he? 
###ENOBARBUS
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one. 
###ANTONY
Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land. By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood. Will you fight well? 
###ENOBARBUS
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” 
###ANTONY
Well put. Come on. Call out my household servants. 
##Three or four SERVANTS enter.
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat. 
##He greets the SERVANTS one by one.
Give me your hand; you’ve been truly honest—so have you and you—and you—you too. You have all served me well, and kings are your peers. 
###CLEOPATRA
, ENOBARBUS
(aside to ) What is this? 
###ENOBARBUS
, CLEOPATRA
(aside to ) It’s one of those nostalgic moods caused by sorrow. 
###ANTONY
, SERVANT
(to another ) And you’re honest too. I wish I could split into as many men as there are servants here before me, and that all of you could merge into a single Antony, so I could give you the same good service you’ve given me. 
###ALL THE SERVANTS
The gods forbid! 
###ANTONY
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight. Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands. 
###CLEOPATRA
, ENOBARBUS
(to ) Why is he doing this? 
###ENOBARBUS
, CLEOPATRA
(to ) He wants to make his followers weep. 
###ANTONY
, SERVANTS
(to the ) Wait on me tonight. It’s possible that this will be the end of your service. It’s possible you won’t see me again, or if you do, it will only be my mangled body. Perhaps tomorrow you’ll be serving another master. I look upon you as a person saying good-bye. My honest friends, I won’t turn you away, but like a master dependent on your good service, I will stay with you until death separates us. Serve me tonight for two hours—I don’t ask any more—and may the gods bless you for it. 
###ENOBARBUS
What are you doing, sir? You’re making them uncomfortable. Look—they’re crying. And I’m just foolish enough to tear up myself. It’s embarrassing. Don’t turn us into women. 
###ANTONY
Ha, ha, ha! May the evil one take me if I meant it like that! Those tears will bring blessings to you. You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends. I spoke to encourage you, asking that you help me make this night a brilliant one. You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death. Let’s go to supper. Come, and let’s drown our worries. 
##They exit.
##A company of SOLDIERS enters.
###FIRST SOLDIER
Good night, brother. Tomorrow is the day. 
###SECOND SOLDIER
This battle will determine who wins the war. Take care of yourself. Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city? 
###FIRST SOLDIER
No. What was it? 
###SECOND SOLDIER
It was probably just a rumor. Good night. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Well sir, good night. 
##Two other SOLDIERS enter.
###SECOND SOLDIER
Soldiers, watch carefully. 
###THIRD SOLDIER
You too. Good night. Good night. 
##Each SOLDIER takes a post at a corner of the stage.
###SECOND SOLDIER
This is our station. And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated. 
##Oboe music comes from underneath the stage.
###SECOND SOLDIER
Quiet! What’s that sound? 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Listen! Listen! 
###SECOND SOLDIER
Listen! 
###FIRST SOLDIER
There’s music coming out of thin air. 
###THIRD SOLDIER
From under the earth. 
###FOURTH SOLDIER
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it? 
###THIRD SOLDIER
No. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Quiet, I say. What does this mean? 
###SECOND SOLDIER
It means that Antony’s patron god, Hercules, is leaving him. 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Let’s walk over and see if the other soldiers heard the same thing. 
##They go to speak with the other SOLDIERS.
###SECOND SOLDIER
Hello there, good sirs. 
###ALL
(speaking at the same time) What now? What now? Do you hear that? 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Yes. Isn’t it strange? 
###THIRD SOLDIER
Do you hear that, men? Do you? 
###FIRST SOLDIER
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops. 
###ALL
Good idea. It’s very strange. 
##They exit.
## ANTONY and CLEOPATRA enter with CHARMIAN and others of the court.
###ANTONY
(calling) Eros! Bring my armor, Eros. 
###CLEOPATRA
Get a little sleep. 
###ANTONY
No, my dear . . . Eros, come on, bring my armor, Eros. 
## EROS enters, carrying ANTONY’s armor.
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying. If luck deserts us today, it’s because we defy it. Come on. 
###CLEOPATRA
No, I’ll help too. What’s this part for? 
##She picks up a piece of the armor.
###ANTONY
Ah, leave it alone. Leave it alone! You armor my heart. No! No! That part goes there. 
###CLEOPATRA
Really, I’ll help. It must go like this. 
###ANTONY
Yes, well done. We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow? Go and put on your own armor. 
###EROS
In a minute, sir. 
###CLEOPATRA
Didn’t I buckle this well? 
###ANTONY
Excellently, excellently. Anyone who unbuckles this before I want to take it off to rest will be sorry.—You’re fumbling, Eros. My Queen’s a better squire than you are. Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft. 
##An armed SOLDIER enters.
Good morning to you. Welcome. You look like a person who knows the business of war. When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully. 
###SOLDIER
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor. 
##A shout is heard, then a trumpet fanfare.
## CAPTAINS and SOLDIERS enter.
###CAPTAIN
The weather is fair. Good morning, General. 
###ALL
Good morning, General. 
###ANTONY
, CLEOPATRA
That was a fine fanfare, boys. Like a young man who wants to amount to something, this morning begins early. (to ) So, so. Here, give me that. This is how it goes on. Well done. Farewell, lady. 
##He kisses her.
###CLEOPATRA
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss. It would be shameful to draw out our good-byes. I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel. (to the others) Anyone who wants to fight, follow me now, and I’ll see you get your wish. (to ) Good-bye. 
## ANTONY and EROS exit with the CAPTAINS and SOLDIERS.
###CHARMIAN
If it pleases you, let’s go to your room. 
###CLEOPATRA
Lead the way. He goes forth to war bravely. If only he and Caesar could determine the outcome of this war by single combat! Then Antony would—but, with circumstances as they are—well, let’s go. 
##They exit.
##Trumpets sound. ANTONY and EROS enter and are met by a SOLDIER entering from another direction.
###SOLDIER
May the gods bless Antony today! 
###ANTONY
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land. 
###SOLDIER
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you. 
###ANTONY
Who deserted this morning? 
###SOLDIER
You don’t know? Someone who was always near you. If you call for Enobarbus, he won’t hear you. Or if he can hear you from Caesar’s camp, he’ll reply, “I’m no longer on your side.” 
###ANTONY
What are you saying? 
###SOLDIER
Sir, he’s with Caesar. 
###EROS
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure. 
###ANTONY
He’s gone? 
###SOLDIER
It’s certain. 
###ANTONY
Eros, send his treasure to him. Do it now. Don’t keep anything back, I insist. Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes. Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master. Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors. Hurry. Enobarbus! 
##They exit.
##Trumpet fanfare. AGRIPPA and CAESAR enter with ENOBARBUS and DOLABELLA.
###CAESAR
Agrippa, go start the battle. We want Antony taken alive. Make sure everyone knows that. 
###AGRIPPA
I will, Caesar. 
##He exits.
###CAESAR
An era of universal peace is about to start. If this battle goes well for us, there will be peace in all three corners of the world. 
##A MESSENGER enters.
###MESSENGER
Antony has come onto the battlefield. 
###CAESAR
Go order Agrippa to put the men who deserted Antony’s army at the front. That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men. 
##Everyone exits except ENOBARBUS.
###ENOBARBUS
Alexas deserted. He went to Judea as if on Antony’s business, but he persuaded Herod to support Caesar instead. Caesar hanged him for this service. Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust. I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again. 
##A SOLDIER of Caesar’s enters.
###SOLDIER
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides. The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent. 
###ENOBARBUS
It’s yours. 
###SOLDIER
Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus. I’m telling you the truth. You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return. I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post. Your Emperor is still a king among gods. 
##He exits.
###ENOBARBUS
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best. Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold! My heart feels like it’s about to explode. If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well. I, fight against you, Antony? No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in. The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life. 
##He exits.
##A call to battle is sounded. Drums and trumpets sound. AGRIPPA and other soldiers of Caesar’s enter.
###AGRIPPA
Retreat! We’ve advanced too far. Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected. 
##They exit.
##A battle call. ANTONY enters with SCARUS, who is wounded.
###SCARUS
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight! If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads. 
###ANTONY
You’re bleeding a lot. 
###SCARUS
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” 
##Distant trumpets sound the retreat.
###ANTONY
They’re retreating. 
###SCARUS
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines. I still have room for six more wounds. 
## EROS enters.
###EROS
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory. 
###SCARUS
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind. It’s fair game to mark a coward. 
###ANTONY
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage. Come on. 
###SCARUS
I’ll limp after you. 
##They exit.
##A battle call. ANTONY marches in, followed by SCARUS and others.
###ANTONY
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp. One of you run to the Queen with the news. 
##A soldier exits.
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today. I want to thank all of you. You’re formidable. You fought not as if you served the cause but as though it were as much your personal fight as mine. You are all Hectors. Go on into the city. Embrace your wives and your friends. Describe your feats for them while they cry for joy. Their tears will wash the congealed blood from your wounds, and they will kiss those honorable cuts until they heal. 
## CLEOPATRA enters.
###SCARUS
, CLEOPATRA
(to ) Give me your hand. I’ll praise your actions to this powerful enchantress so that she will thank you with blessings. Oh, light of the world, (to ) wrap your arms around my armored neck. Leap, with all your finery through my armor and go straight to my heart. There you can ride upon my heartbeats, sharing in my triumph. 
###CLEOPATRA
Lord of lords! Your courage is infinite. Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world? 
###ANTONY
, SCARUS
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds. What do you think, girl! Even though there are some gray hairs among the brown, I still have a brain and muscles that will let me compete with younger men. Look at this man. Show him favor by letting him kiss your hand. (to ) Kiss it, my warrior. 
## SCARUS kisses CLEOPATRA’s hand
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind. 
###CLEOPATRA
, SCARUS
(to ) Friend, I’ll give you armor made of gold. It belonged to a king. 
###ANTONY
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy Phoebus’ car. Give me your hand. Let’s have a cheerful march through Alexandria, proudly carrying our dented shields. If we had enough room in the palace to house this army, we’d all eat together and toast tomorrow, which promises to be full of danger. Trumpeters, blast the city’s ears. Mix your fanfares with our drums, so that sounds from both heaven and earth will herald our approach. 
##Everyone exits.
##A SENTRY and his company enter, followed by ENOBARBUS.
###SENTRY
If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks. The night is bright, and they say we’ll be forming for battle by two a.m. 
###FIRST WATCH
That last day was a hard one for us. 
###ENOBARBUS
Oh, listen to me, night— 
###SECOND WATCH
Who is this? 
###FIRST WATCH
Stay hidden and listen. 
###ENOBARBUS
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon. The men who revolted against Antony will be remembered scornfully in the history books. But poor Enobarbus repented. 
###SENTRY
That’s Enobarbus? 
###SECOND WATCH
Quiet! Keep listening. 
###ENOBARBUS
Oh, moon, you queen of sadness, drop poisonous dew on me so that my life, which continues against my wishes, will end. Take my heart and throw it against my hard, stony sin. My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind. Oh, Antony! You are more noble than my revolt is dishonorable. Forgive my crimes against you, but let history record me as a fugitive traitor. Oh, Antony! Oh, Antony! 
##He dies.
###FIRST WATCH
Let’s speak to him. 
###SENTRY
Let’s listen to him. He may say something concerning Caesar. 
###SECOND WATCH
Good idea. But he’s sleeping. 
###SENTRY
It looks more like he fainted. No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep. 
###FIRST WATCH
Let’s go to him. 
###SECOND WATCH
Wake up, sir, wake up. Speak to us. 
###FIRST WATCH
Do you hear us, sir? 
###SENTRY
The hand of death has taken him. 
##Drums are heard in the distance.
Listen. The drums softly wake the sleepers. Let’s carry him to the barracks. He’s an important person. Our hour is up. 
###SECOND WATCH
Come on, then. He may recover yet. 
##They exit, carrying ENOBARBUS’s body.
## ANTONY and SCARUS enter, with the army.
###ANTONY
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today. We didn’t please them on land. 
###SCARUS
We’re ready for both, my lord. 
###ANTONY
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air. We’d meet them there too. But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city. Orders have been given to the navy and they’ve left port. We’ll be able to analyze and direct the battle better from the hills. 
##They exit.
## CAESAR and his army enter.
###CAESAR
We won’t move our land forces unless we’re attacked. And I doubt that will happen, since most of Antony’s men are with his navy. Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys. 
##They exit.
## ANTONY and SCARUS enter.
###ANTONY
They still haven’t joined the battle. I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there. I’ll let you know right away how it’s going. 
##He exits.
##Noises like a sea battle are heard in the distance.
###SCARUS
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails. The fortunetellers won’t say whether that’s a good sign or a bad one, but they don’t look happy. Antony is valiant and dejected. His mood changes by fits and starts; his checkered luck vacillates between hope and fear, winning and losing. 
## ANTONY enters.
###ANTONY
All is lost! This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me. My fleet has surrendered to the enemy. You can see them over there throwing their hats up in the air and drinking together like long lost friends. Three-time traitor and whore! It’s you who have sold me to this youth, Caesar. Now my war is only with you. Tell the army to flee. Revenge on Cleopatra will be my last act. Order them to escape. Go! 
## SCARUS exits. 
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises. Luck and Antony separate here and now. Here we’ll shake hands good-bye. Is it all come to this? The brave men who followed me like little dogs, whom I rewarded, have left me to follow Caesar. I’ve been stripped of everything, betrayed. Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit! Her charms launched my wars and called them back again. Pleasing her was my main goal, and she lured me to total defeat. (calling out) Where are you, Eros! Eros! 
## CLEOPATRA enters.
Ah, you sorceress! Be gone! 
###CLEOPATRA
Why is my lord enraged against his love? 
###ANTONY
Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory. Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds! Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender. Let them exhibit you to the public for meager coins, like a monstrosity. Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails. 
## CLEOPATRA exits.
If you wish to live, you had better get out of here. But I think it would have been better if you’d let me kill you. One death would have prevented the deaths of many others.—Eros, ho!—I’m wearing the shirt of Nessus. Hercules, my ancestor, teach me how to feel your rage. I’ll toss Lichas to the moon and use my mighty hands to kill my better self. The witch shall die. She sold me to that young Roman boy and now I’m ruined. She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho! 
##He exits.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN enter.
###CLEOPATRA
Help me, ladies! Oh, Antony is more furious than Telamon, who killed himself in a jealous rage. The wild boar of Thessaly, which the goddess Diana sent to punish King Caledon for neglecting her sacrifices, didn’t foam at the mouth as much as Antony does now. 
###CHARMIAN
Go to your tomb! Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead. When a great person departs, it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body. 
###CLEOPATRA
To my tomb! Mardian, go tell him I’ve killed myself. Say the last word I spoke was “Antony,” and please word it pathetically. Go, Mardian, and let me know how he reacts to my death. (to the others) To the tomb! 
##They all exit.
## ANTONY and EROS enter.
###ANTONY
Eros, can you still see me? 
###EROS
Yes, noble lord. 
###ANTONY
Sometimes we see a cloud that looks like a dragon. Sometimes there’s a cloud like a bear or a lion, a castle, a floating rock, a craggy mountain. Or it might look like a blue cliff with trees on it that bow to the ground. These things fool our eyes by seeming solid, when they are actually only air. You’ve seen these illusions. They’re spectacles that appear at sunset. 
###EROS
Yes, my lord. 
###ANTONY
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water. 
###EROS
That’s true, my lord. 
###ANTONY
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud. Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy. I went to war to save Cleopatra, whose love I thought I had, since she had mine—and mine carried with it a million others, those of my soldiers, now lost. The Queen conspired with Caesar to undermine my success and assure his victory. No, don’t cry, kind Eros. We still have the option of killing ourselves. 
## MARDIAN enters.
Oh, your contemptible lady! She has disarmed me. 
###MARDIAN
No, Antony. My mistress loved you, and her destiny was completely joined with yours. 
###ANTONY
Get out, insolent eunuch! Silence! She has betrayed me and shall die. 
###MARDIAN
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full. What you wanted is yours. Her last words were “Antony! Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words. “Antony” was divided between her heart and lips. She gave up her life with your name still within her. 
###ANTONY
Is she dead, then? 
###MARDIAN
Dead. 
###ANTONY
, MARDIAN
Remove your armor, Eros. The long day’s work is over, and it is time to sleep. (to ) Permission to leave unharmed is abundant payment for your news. Go! 
## MARDIAN exits.
###EROS
Off! Take off my armor. Not even Ajax’s famous shield, made of seven layers of oxhide and covered in bronze, could protect my heart from this attack. Oh, chest, obey me! Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined. Break out of my ribcage! Faster, Eros, faster. I won’t be a soldier anymore. Battered armor, be off. You were worn with honor. (to ) Leave me awhile. 
## EROS exits.
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness. It’s the only way left, because now any extension of my life would be torture. Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here. Now any effort ruins what it attempts. Yes, even power gets in its own way. End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me. In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor. Those famous lovers, Dido and Aeneas, will lose their admirers, and the whole place will be devoted to us.—Come, Eros. Eros! 
## EROS enters.
###EROS
What can I do for my lord? 
###ANTONY
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace. Though I have made conquests throughout the four corners of the world and sailed with fleets so large they looked like floating cities, I don’t have as much courage as a woman. I have less nobility than the lady who, by killing herself, says to Caesar, “Only Cleopatra can defeat Cleopatra.” You promised me, Eros, that should the ultimate moment arrive—which it has—when dishonor and disgust are inevitable, that upon my command, you would kill me. Do it. This is that time. You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar. Call up your courage. 
###EROS
The gods forbid! Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though shot by enemies, could not? 
###ANTONY
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation? 
###EROS
I would not. 
###ANTONY
Then come on. I must be restored to health by an injury. Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country. 
###EROS
Oh, sir, pardon me! 
###ANTONY
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you? Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose. Take out your sword and come on. 
###EROS
Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores. 
###ANTONY
Look! 
##He turns away.
###EROS
I have drawn my sword. 
###ANTONY
Now let it carry out its purpose immediately. 
###EROS
My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I strike this fatal blow: farewell. 
###ANTONY
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you. 
###EROS
Good-bye, great commander. Should I do it now? 
###ANTONY
Now, Eros. 
###EROS
Well, then, there! 
##He stabs himself.
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death. 
##He dies.
###ANTONY
Brave Eros, three times more honorable than I am! You teach me what I should do but could not. My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books. But I will embrace death as a bridegroom does his bride, and rush to it as to a lover’s bed. Come then. Eros, your master dies your student. I learned to do this from you. 
##He falls on his sword.
What! I’m not dead? Not dead?—Guard, here! Oh, kill me! 
## DERCETUS enters with three GUARDS.
###FIRST GUARD
What’s the trouble? 
###ANTONY
I’ve botched the job, friends. Oh, finish what I’ve begun. 
###SECOND GUARD
Our guiding light is out. 
###FIRST GUARD
And time itself is ended. 
###ALL
Sadness and despair! 
###ANTONY
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead. 
###FIRST GUARD
Not me. 
###SECOND GUARD
Me neither. 
###THIRD GUARD
None of us. 
##The GUARDS exit.
###DERCETAS
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape. 
##He takes up ANTONY’s sword
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor. 
## DIOMEDES enters.
###DIOMEDES
Where’s Antony? 
###DERCETAS
There, Diomedes, there. 
###DIOMEDES
Is he still alive? Why don’t you answer me, man? 
## DERCETAS exits.
###ANTONY
Is that you, Diomedes? Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me. 
###DIOMEDES
Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you. 
###ANTONY
When did she send you? 
###DIOMEDES
Just now, my lord. 
###ANTONY
Where is she? 
###DIOMEDES
Locked in her tomb. She had a premonition of what has actually happened. She saw that you suspected her of negotiating a treaty with Caesar—which never will be true. Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead. But later, fearing how that news might affect you, she sent me to tell you the truth. I’m afraid I’ve come too late. 
###ANTONY
Too late, good Diomedes. Call my guard, please. 
###DIOMEDES
Hey out there! Emperor’s guards! Guards, hey! Come! Your lord calls for you! 
##Four or five of Antony’s GUARDS enter.
###ANTONY
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is. It’s the last command I shall ever give you. 
###FIRST GUARD
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands. 
###ALL
It’s a very sad day. 
###ANTONY
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well. If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly. Pick me up. I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything. 
##They exit, carrying ANTONY and EROS’ body.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS enter with Cleopatra’s maids in the upper gallery.
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb! 
###CHARMIAN
Be calm, dear lady. 
###CLEOPATRA
No, I won’t. Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts. The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source. 
## DIOMEDES enters below.
What’s the news! Is he dead? 
###DIOMEDES
He is close to death, but not dead yet. Look out the other window; his guard has brought him here. 
##Guards enter, carrying ANTONY.
###CLEOPATRA
Oh, sun, burn up the orbit in which you move, so that the world may be dark forever! Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help! Help, friends below; lift him up here. 
###ANTONY
Be calm! It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself. 
###CLEOPATRA
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony. But how terrible that it has happened! 
###ANTONY
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying. I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips. 
###CLEOPATRA
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture. I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize. If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate. Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me. But come. Come up here, Antony—help me, ladies—we must carry you up. Help us, good friends. 
##They lift him.
###ANTONY
Oh, quick, before I’m gone. 
###CLEOPATRA
Such exercise! My lord is so heavy! Our strength has all turned into sadness. That’s what makes the weight. If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove. Up just a little more—wishes are always foolish—oh, come on, come on, come on! 
##They lift ANTONY up to CLEOPATRA. 
And welcome, welcome! Die where you have lived, in my arms. Let me revive you with my kisses. If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this. 
##She kisses him.
###ALL
What a sad sight! 
###ANTONY
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying. Give me some wine and let me say a few words. 
###CLEOPATRA
No, let me talk, and let me scold to the heavens, so that Fortune, that deceitful hussy, will become so upset that she breaks her wheel. 
###ANTONY
One thing, dear Queen: request honor, as well as safety, from Caesar. Oh! 
###CLEOPATRA
Honor and safety do not go together. 
###ANTONY
Dear, listen to me: don’t trust any of Caesar’s men besides Proculeius. 
###CLEOPATRA
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men. 
###ANTONY
Don’t mourn over this unhappy reversal of fortune at the end of my life. Remember my earlier lot, when I lived as the greatest, most noble prince in the world. I’m not dying shamefully, doffing my helmet to my countryman like a coward, but as a Roman, honorably conquered by another Roman. Now I feel my soul leaving. I can’t speak any more. 
###CLEOPATRA
Most noble man, will you die? Don’t you care about me? Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you? Oh, look, ladies. The best of the world disappears. My lord! 
## ANTONY dies.
Oh, the glory of war has faded. The flags have fallen. Young boys and girls are equal to men. There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world. 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, stay calm, lady! 
## CLEOPATRA faints.
###IRAS
Our Queen is dead too. 
###CHARMIAN
Lady! 
###IRAS
Madam! 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, madam, madam, madam! 
###IRAS
Royal Egypt, Empress! 
## CLEOPATRA wakes up.
###CHARMIAN
Quiet, quiet, Iras. 
###CLEOPATRA
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores. I might now hurl my scepter at the destructive gods and tell them that this earthly world was as good as their heavenly one, until they stole away its jewel, Antony. Now all is for nothing. Patience is foolish. Impatience suits a mad dog. So why should it be a sin to rush toward death, to seek it out in its hiding place before it dares to come to find me? How are you, my ladies? Tell me! Cheer up! How are you, Charmian? My gallant girls! Ah, ladies, look: the light of our lives has gone out. Good noble ladies, be brave. We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us. Come on, you can go. The container of that great soul is now cold. Ah, ladies, ladies! Let’s go. We have no friends but determination and the quickest death. 
##They exit, carrying ANTONY’s body.
## CAESAR enters with his war council: AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MAECENAS, GALLUS, and PROCULEIUS.
###CAESAR
Dolabella, go see Antony. Tell him to surrender. His position is hopeless. This delay makes him look ridiculous. 
###DOLABELLA
Right away, Caesar. 
## DOLABELLA exits.
## DECRETUS enters carrying ANTONY’s sword.
###CAESAR
What are you doing with a sword? Who do you think you are coming in here armed? 
###DECRETUS
My name is Decretus. I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services. While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies. If you accept my service, I’ll serve you the same way. If not, you can kill me. 
###CAESAR
What are you saying? 
###DECRETUS
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead. 
###CAESAR
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap. The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens. This isn’t the death of one man. It’s the death of half the world. 
###DECRETUS
He’s dead, Caesar. Not by public execution or an assassin’s knife. He killed himself with the same hand that performed such brave acts. With the courage his heart lent his hand, his hand in turn split his heart. This is his sword. I pulled it from his wound. Look—his noble blood is still on it. 
###CAESAR
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry. 
###AGRIPPA
It’s strange that human nature makes us grieve for the very thing we’ve been trying to achieve. 
###MAECENAS
His faults were equally matched by his virtues. 
###AGRIPPA
There was never a ruler as excellent as he. But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human. Caesar is upset. 
###MAECENAS
It’s impossible for him not to see himself in Antony. 
###CAESAR
Oh, Antony. I drove you to this. But we have to get rid of a disease if it threatens our body. Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me. There wasn’t enough room in the world for both of us. Even so, let me mourn, with tears that heal like a bloodletting, that you—my brother, my greatest competitor, my partner in rule, my friend and companion on the battlefield, the very arm of my body, and the heart in which mine own heart’s thoughts lived—that our fates could not be reconciled, which caused us to divide ourselves from one another. Let me tell you, friends— 
##An EGYPTIAN enters.
###EGYPTIAN
I’ll tell you at a better time. This man looks like his business is urgent. Let’s hear what he has to say. (to ) Who are you? 
###EGYPTIAN
A poor Egyptian, but my mistress, the Queen, sent me to find out what your intentions are concerning her. She’s locked up in her tomb and wants to prepare herself for her fate. 
###CAESAR
Tell her to put her mind at rest. She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her. I cannot be taught how to be cruel. 
###EGYPTIAN
May the gods bless you. 
##He exits.
###CAESAR
Come here, Proculeius. Tell her we mean her no disrespect. Give her whatever assurances you feel she needs to keep her from killing herself. I need her alive, so that I can exhibit her in my triumphal procession and gain eternal fame. Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind. 
###PROCULEIUS
I will, Caesar. 
## PROCULEIUS exits.
###CAESAR
Gallus, you go with him. 
## GALLUS exits.
Where’s Dolabella? He’s supposed to support Proculeius. 
###ALL
Dolabella! 
###CAESAR
Never mind. I remember he’s already occupied. He’ll be done in time. Come with me. In my tent I’ll show you how unwillingly I was drawn into this war. You’ll see how calm and gentle my letters to Antony always were. Come and see the proof. 
##They exit.
## CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS enter.
###CLEOPATRA
Being alone has helped me better understand my life. It’s pathetic to be Caesar. He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy. It would be a great deed to commit suicide—that act which ends all other things, which makes all accidents and changes stop. Which causes you to sleep, and takes you away from earthly concerns. 
## PROCULEIUS enters.
###PROCULEIUS
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him. 
###CLEOPATRA
What’s your name? 
###PROCULEIUS
My name is Proculeius. 
###CLEOPATRA
Antony told me about you. He said you were a man I could trust. But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust. If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom. If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks. 
###PROCULEIUS
Be content. You’re in the charge of an honorable man. Don’t be afraid. You can ask for anything from my lord. His generosity flows to anyone in need. If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you. 
###CLEOPATRA
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune. I give up to him the glory he has won. I’m learning every hour how to be subservient. I’d be happy to meet with him in person. 
###PROCULEIUS
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady. Be at ease. I know he’s sorry for your situation, especially since he caused it. 
## GALLUS enters with soldiers. They seize CLEOPATRA.
###GALLUS
, PROCULEIUS
(to ) See how easy it was to capture her? (to soldiers) Guard her until Caesar arrives. 
###IRAS
Your majesty! 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, Cleopatra! You’ve been betrayed, my Queen! 
## CLEOPATRA pulls out a knife.
###CLEOPATRA
Quick, quick good hands! 
##She tries to stab herself, but PROCULEIUS seizes the dagger.
###PROCULEIUS
Stop, brave lady, stop! Don’t do such a shameful thing to yourself. We’ve rescued you from yourself. We have not betrayed you. 
###CLEOPATRA
What, am I being denied death, as well? The thing which even dogs are given, to rid them of their suffering? 
###PROCULEIUS
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself. The world will see how noble he is by the way he treats you. Your death would prevent that. 
###CLEOPATRA
Where are you, Death? Come here. Come, and you can have a queen. One queen is worth more than a whole number of babies and beggars, your cheapest conquests. 
###PROCULEIUS
Oh, control yourself, lady! 
###CLEOPATRA
Sir, I won’t eat. I won’t drink. And don’t expect me to talk. I won’t sleep either. I’ll destroy my body. Let Caesar do whatever he wants. You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia. Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome? I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave. I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting. I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids! 
###PROCULEIUS
You’re letting yourself get carried away with these horrible thoughts. You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so. 
## DOLABELLA enters.
###DOLABELLA
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you. I’ll take the Queen into my custody. 
###PROCULEIUS
, CLEOPATRA
So be it, Dolabella. Caesar’s thanks are my greatest reward. Be kind to her. (to ) I’ll relay to Caesar any request you want to give me. 
###CLEOPATRA
Tell him I’d like to die. 
## PROCULEIUS exits.
###DOLABELLA
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress? 
###CLEOPATRA
I don’t remember. 
###DOLABELLA
I’m sure you’ve heard of me. 
###CLEOPATRA
It doesn’t matter what I’ve heard or known. You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams. Isn’t that your habit? 
###DOLABELLA
I don’t know what you mean, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony. Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that! 
###DOLABELLA
If you’d like— 
###CLEOPATRA
Authority radiated from his face, and his presence brought knowledge and order to the people of earth. 
###DOLABELLA
Your majesty— 
###CLEOPATRA
His power extended from one shore to the other, as if he straddled the ocean with his legs. When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled. He spoke exquisitely to his friends, but when he wanted to terrify the world, his voice was like thunder. There was no end to his generosity. The more he gave, the more he wanted to give. His amusements showed another side of him, one detached from his world of responsibility and duty. Kings and noblemen served him. Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change. 
###DOLABELLA
Cleopatra— 
###CLEOPATRA
Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about? 
###DOLABELLA
No, gentle madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
The gods can hear you lying! But if there ever were such a man, simple dreams could never contain his greatness. When it comes to creating fantastical things, the natural world cannot compete with imagination. And yet, if the natural world could create something like Antony, it would have a masterpiece to rival anything fantasy might construct. Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings. 
###DOLABELLA
Listen to me, madam. You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable. You are responding appropriately to the greatness of that loss. I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now. 
###CLEOPATRA
Thank you, sir. Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me? 
###DOLABELLA
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew. 
###CLEOPATRA
Please, sir— 
###DOLABELLA
Though he is honorable— 
###CLEOPATRA
He’ll still parade me through Rome as a trophy of war. 
###DOLABELLA
I know he will, madam. 
##Trumpets sound a royal fanfare. CAESAR, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS, MAECENAS, and other ATTENDANTS enter.
###ATTENDANTS
Stand aside for Caesar. 
###CAESAR
Which of these ladies is the Queen of Egypt? 
###DOLABELLA
, CLEOPATRA
(to ) It’s the Emperor, madam. 
## CLEOPATRA kneels.
###CAESAR
Arise. You need not kneel to me. Please rise, Queen. 
###CLEOPATRA
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir. You are my lord and master. I must obey. 
## CLEOPATRA stands up.
###CAESAR
Don’t think I blame you. Whatever injuries I received in the war, I put down to the fortunes of war. 
###CLEOPATRA
You are now the sole lord of the entire world. I can’t explain my cause very clearly. I must admit to having the weaknesses that all women are accused of. 
###CAESAR
Cleopatra, understand that, rather than emphasize our power over you, we will soften if you accept our intentions, which are very compassionate toward you. Your acceptance will benefit you, but if you try to make me look cruel by committing suicide as Antony did, I won’t be so generous. Your children will be destroyed, a fate your submission will save them from. I’ll leave you now. 
###CLEOPATRA
You may do whatever you want in the world. It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like. Here, my good lord. 
##She hands him a list.
###CAESAR
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra. 
###CLEOPATRA
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession. It’s an exact list. Not even trivial things were left out. Where’s Seleucus? 
## SELEUCUS enters.
###SELEUCUS
Here, madam. 
###CLEOPATRA
This is my treasurer. My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus. 
###SELEUCUS
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it. 
###CLEOPATRA
What did I keep for myself? 
###SELEUCUS
Enough to buy everything you have declared. 
###CAESAR
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra. You’re very prudent to set a little aside. 
###CLEOPATRA
, SELEUCUS
Look around you, Caesar. Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over! What is mine will be yours now. If we were to change places, what is yours would be mine. Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild. (to ) Oh, you slave! I can’t trust you any more than a prostitute. What are you doing? Cringing away? I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you. I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly. You slave! Soulless villain! Dog! Oh, that was unbelievably low! 
###CAESAR
Good Queen, let me implore you— 
###CLEOPATRA
, SELEUCUS
Oh, Caesar, I am so ashamed. You condescended to visit me here, honoring my humble self with your lordly presence. And one of my own servants increases my disgrace by adding his envy! Suppose, good Caesar, that I have saved a few feminine trifles, some unimportant trinkets. These have worth only as gifts to friends. And suppose I have kept a few more expensive gifts aside for Livia and Octavia, to solicit their good wishes. Must I then be exposed by a person I’ve supported? By the gods! It adds another blow to the many I have already. (to ) Please leave, or I’ll show you what’s left of my spirit since my fortune was ruined. If you were a real man, you would have had mercy on me. 
###CAESAR
Leave, Seleucus. 
## SELEUCUS exits.
###CLEOPATRA
You should also know that as head of state, we are often blamed for the crimes of others. And though we may fall, we are still responsible for their offenses. I am therefore to be pitied. 
###CAESAR
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed. It’s all still yours. Do whatever you like with it. You can trust that Caesar is not a merchant to haggle with you over your property. So cheer up. Don’t be captured by your depressed thoughts. No, dear Queen. We want to follow your own counsel when making arrangements for you. Eat and sleep. I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend. And so, good-bye. 
###CLEOPATRA
My master and my lord! 
###CAESAR
Not true. Good-bye. 
##Trumpet flourish. CAESAR and his entourage exit.
###CLEOPATRA
He’s trying to talk me into forgetting my nobility, girls. But listen, Charmian. 
##She whispers to CHARMIAN.
###IRAS
It’s time to end it, good lady. The bright day of our lives is over, and now there will only be darkness. 
###CLEOPATRA
, CHARMIAN
(to ) Go out again. I’ve already given the order, and it is ready. Hurry with your errand. 
###CHARMIAN
I will, madam. 
## DOLABELLA enters.
###DOLABELLA
Where’s the Queen? 
###CHARMIAN
Look, sir. 
##She exits.
###CLEOPATRA
Dolabella. 
###DOLABELLA
Madam, according to my promise—which my love to you has made a religious vow—I tell you that Caesar intends to travel through Syria. Within three days you and your children will be sent ahead. Make the best use of this information you can. I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise. 
###CLEOPATRA
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you. 
###DOLABELLA
And I your servant. Good-bye, good Queen. I must go attend Caesar. 
###CLEOPATRA
Farewell, and thanks. 
## DOLABELLA exits.
Now, Iras, what do you think? You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets. Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see. Their stinking breath will form a cloud around us, and we’ll be forced to inhale it. 
###IRAS
The gods forbid! 
###CLEOPATRA
No, it’s certain, Iras. Insolent lictors will paw us as if we were streetwalkers. Disreputable minstrels will write bawdy songs about us. Hotheaded comedians will stage impromptu impersonations of us and depict the celebrations we had in Alexandria. Antony will be portrayed as a drunk, and I’ll see some boy with a squeaking voice play Cleopatra as if I were a whore. 
###IRAS
Oh, the good gods! 
###CLEOPATRA
No, that’s the truth. 
###IRAS
I’ll never see it. I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out. 
###CLEOPATRA
Why, that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions. 
## CHARMIAN enters.
###IRAS
Now, Charmian! Women, dress me like a queen. Go get my best clothes. I will once again be as fine as when I went to Cydnus to meet Marc Antony.—Iras, go.—Now, Charmian, we’ll be quick indeed. And after you’ve done this chore, I’ll give you permission to amuse yourself until doomsday. (to ) Bring our crown and all the royal symbols of office. 
## IRAS exits. A noise offstage.
What’s that noise? 
##A GUARDSMAN enters.
###GUARDSMAN
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness. He has brought you figs. 
###CLEOPATRA
Let him come in. 
##The GUARDSMAN exits.
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed! He brings me freedom. My mind is made up. There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me. Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble. Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me. 
##The GUARDSMAN enters with a COUNTRYMAN, who carries a basket.
###GUARDSMAN
This is the man. 
###CLEOPATRA
Leave us. 
##The GUARDSMAN exits.
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain? 
###COUNTRYMAN
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him. His bite is fatal. People who die of it seldom or never recover. 
###CLEOPATRA
Do you remember anyone who died of it? 
###COUNTRYMAN
Many people, men and women alike. I heard of one just yesterday. She was a very honest woman but rather inclined to lie—which a woman shouldn’t do unless she’s protecting her reputation. I heard how she died of its bite, how much pain she felt. Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power. But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do. But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake. 
###CLEOPATRA
You may leave now. Farewell. 
###COUNTRYMAN
I hope you are pleased with the snake. 
##He sets down the basket.
###CLEOPATRA
Farewell. 
###COUNTRYMAN
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature. 
###CLEOPATRA
Yes, yes. Farewell. 
###COUNTRYMAN
Listen, the snake is dangerous unless handled by people who are used to him. There isn’t any kindness in the snake. 
###CLEOPATRA
Don’t worry; we’ll remember your warnings. 
###COUNTRYMAN
Good. Don’t feed it, I beg you. It’s not worth feeding. 
###CLEOPATRA
Will it eat me? 
###COUNTRYMAN
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish fit only for the gods, as long as the devil hasn’t prepared the meal. But devils cause a lot of trouble for the gods regarding their women. For every ten women the gods make, the devils ruin five. 
###CLEOPATRA
Well, you can go now. Farewell. 
###COUNTRYMAN
Yes, truly, I wish you good luck with the snake. 
##He exits.
## IRAS enters, carrying CLEOPATRA’s royal regalia.
###CLEOPATRA
Give me my robe. Put on my crown. I long to be immortal. I won’t drink Egyptian wine again. 
## CHARMIAN and IRAS begin to dress her.
Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly. I think I hear Antony call me. I see him revive himself to praise my noble act. I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath. Husband, I’m coming! Now let my courage prove my title as wife. I am now made of fire and air, and I leave the other elements, earth and water, to this mortal life. So, are you done? Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips. Good-bye, kind Charmian. Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time. 
##She kisses them. IRAS collapses and dies.
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips? Did you fall? If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired. Do you lie still? If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye. 
###CHARMIAN
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping! 
###CLEOPATRA
This proves that I’m petty: if Iras meets Antony before me, he’ll want her first and give her the kiss that is my bliss to have. Come, you deadly villain. 
##She puts the snake on her breast.
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth. Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite. Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted! 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, eastern star! 
###CLEOPATRA
Quiet, quiet! Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep? 
###CHARMIAN
Oh, if my heart would only break! 
###CLEOPATRA
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too. 
##She puts another snake on her arm.
Why should I stay— 
##She dies.
###CHARMIAN
In this vile world? So, good-bye. Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession. Close, soft eyes. 
##She closes CLEOPATRA’s eyes.
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again. Your crown is crooked. I’ll straighten it, then play— 
##The GUARDS rush in noisily.
###FIRST GUARD
Where’s the Queen? 
###CHARMIAN
Speak softly. Don’t wake her. 
###FIRST GUARD
Caesar has sent— 
###CHARMIAN
Too slow a messenger. 
##She applies an asp to herself.
Oh, come quickly! I almost feel you. 
###FIRST GUARD
(calling) Come in. Ho! All’s not well. Caesar’s been deceived. 
###SECOND GUARD
There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar. Call him. 
##The SECOND GUARD exits.
###FIRST GUARD
What kind of work is this, Charmian? Is this well done? 
###CHARMIAN
It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings. Ah, soldier! 
##She dies.
## DOLABELLA enters.
###DOLABELLA
What’s going on in here? 
###SECOND GUARD
They’re all dead. 
###DOLABELLA
Caesar, you thought this would happen. You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop. 
## CAESAR and his entourage enter, marching.
###ALL
Step aside, step aside for Caesar! 
###DOLABELLA
Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future. What you were afraid of has happened. 
###CAESAR
She was bravest at the end. She knew what I intended to do with her and, being royal, she took her own way out. How did they die? I don’t see any blood. 
###DOLABELLA
Who was with them last? 
###FIRST GUARD
A simple country farmer who brought her figs. This was the basket. 
###CAESAR
They were poisoned, then. 
###FIRST GUARD
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago. She stood and spoke. I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress. She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead. 
###CAESAR
Oh, noble weakness! If they had swallowed poison, it would be evident by external swelling. But she looks like she’s asleep, as if she would charm another Antony. 
###DOLABELLA
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark. There’s a similar mark on her arm. 
###FIRST GUARD
This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile. 
###CAESAR
That’s probably how she died. Her doctor told me she had searched for an infinite number of easy ways to die. Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb. She shall be buried next to her Antony. No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous. Momentous events like these strike those that cause them. Antony and Cleopatra’s story is as pitiable as my military exploits are glorious. Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome. Come, Dolabella. See that there is a dignified splendor to this great solemnity. 
##They exit, with the GUARDS carrying CLEOPATRA’s bed and the two ladies.

## THESEUS and HIPPOLYTA enter with PHILOSTRATE and others.
###THESEUS
Our wedding day is almost here, my beautiful Hippolyta. We’ll be getting married in four days, on the day of the new moon. But it seems to me that the days are passing too slowly—the old moon is taking too long to fade away! That old, slow moon is keeping me from getting what I want, just like an old widow makes her stepson wait to get his inheritance. 
###HIPPOLYTA
No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four nights. And since we dream at night, time passes quickly then. Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look down on our wedding celebration. 
###THESEUS
Go, Philostrate, get the young people of Athens ready to celebrate and have a good time. Sadness is only appropriate for funerals. We don’t want it at our festivities. 
## PHILOSTRATE exits.
Hippolyta, I wooed you with violence, using my sword, and got you to fall in love with me by injuring you. But I’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals, public festivities, and celebration. 
## EGEUS enters with his daughter HERMIA, and LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS.
###EGEUS
Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke! 
###THESEUS
Thanks, good Egeus. What’s new with you? 
###EGEUS
I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter. You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person. You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens. Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed. 
###THESEUS
What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia? Think carefully, pretty girl. You should think of your father as a god, since he’s the one who gave you your beauty. To him, you’re like a figure that he’s sculpted out of wax, and he has the power to keep that figure intact or to disfigure it. Demetrius is an admirable man. 
###HERMIA
So is Lysander. 
###THESEUS
You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too. But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man. 
###HERMIA
I wish my father could see them with my eyes. 
###THESEUS
No, you must see them as your father sees them. 
###HERMIA
Your grace, please forgive me. I don’t know what makes me think I can say this, and I don’t know if speaking my mind to such a powerful and noble person as yourself will damage my reputation for modesty. But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius. 
###THESEUS
You’ll either be executed or you’ll never see another man again. So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia. Consider how young you are, and question your feelings. Then decide whether you could stand to be a nun, wearing a priestess’s habit and caged up in a cloister forever, living your entire life without a husband or children, weakly chanting hymns to the cold and virginal goddess of the moon. People who can restrain their passions and stay virgins forever are holy. But although a virgin priestess might be rewarded in heaven, a married woman is happier on Earth. A married woman is like a rose who is picked and made into a beautiful perfume, while a priestess just withers away on the stem. 
###HERMIA
I’d rather wither away than give up my virginity to someone I don’t love. 
###THESEUS
Take some time to think about this. By the time of the next new moon—the day when Hippolyta and I will be married—be ready either to be executed for disobeying your father, to marry Demetrius as your father wishes, or to take a vow to spend the rest of your life as a virgin priestess of the moon goddess. 
###DEMETRIUS
Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting like she’s yours. I’ve got more of a right to her than you do. 
###LYSANDER
Her father loves you, Demetrius. So why don’t you marry him and let me have Hermia? 
###EGEUS
It’s true, rude Lysander, I do love him. That’s why I’m giving him my daughter. She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius. 
###LYSANDER
(to THESEUS) My lord, I’m just as noble and rich as he is. I love Hermia more than he does. My prospects are as good as his, if not better. And beautiful Hermia loves me—which is more important than all those other things I’m bragging about. Why shouldn’t I be able to marry her? Demetrius—and I’ll say this to his face—courted Nedar’s daughter, Helena, and made her fall in love with him. That sweet lady, Helena, loves devoutly. She adores this horrible and unfaithful man. 
###THESEUS
I have to admit I’ve heard something about that, and meant to ask Demetrius about it, but I was too busy with personal matters and it slipped my mind.—Anyway, Demetrius and Egeus, both of you, come with me. I want to say a few things to you in private.—As for you, beautiful Hermia, get ready to do what your father wants, because otherwise the law says that you must die or become a nun, and there’s nothing I can do about that.—Come with me, Hippolyta. How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us. I want you to do some things for our wedding, and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both. 
###EGEUS
We’re following you not only because it is our duty, but also because we want to. 
##They all exit except LYSANDER and HERMIA.
###LYSANDER
What’s going on, my love? Why are you so pale? Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly? 
###HERMIA
Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain, which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes. 
###LYSANDER
Oh, honey! Listen, in books they say that true love always faces obstacles. Either the lovers have different social standings— 
###HERMIA
Oh, what an obstacle that would be! Imagine being too high on the social ladder, and falling in love with someone beneath you. 
###LYSANDER
Or else they were very different ages— 
###HERMIA
How awful! Being too old to marry someone young. 
###LYSANDER
Or else their guardians and advisors said no— 
###HERMIA
What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else! 
###LYSANDER
Or, even if the lovers are a good match, their love might be ruined by war, death, or sickness, so that the affair only lasts an instant. Their time together might be as fleeting as a shadow or as short as a dream, lasting only as long as it takes a lightning bolt to flash across the sky. Before you can say “look,” it’s gone. That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed. 
###HERMIA
If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate. So let’s try to be patient as we deal with our problem. It’s as normal a part of love as dreams, sighs, wishes, and tears. 
###LYSANDER
That’s the right attitude. So, listen, Hermia. I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children. She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son. I could marry you there, gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us. So here’s the plan. If you love me, sneak out of your father’s house tomorrow night and meet me in the forest a few miles outside of town. 
You remember the place—I met you there once with Helena to celebrate May Day.—I’ll wait for you there. 
###HERMIA
Oh, Lysander, I swear I’ll be there tomorrow. I swear by Cupid’s strongest bow and his best gold-tipped arrow, by the Goddess of Love’s innocent doves, by everything that ties lovers together, by the bonfire where Queen Dido burned herself to death when her lover Aeneas jilted her, and by all the promises that men have broken (and men have broken more promises than women have ever made). I give you my word, I will meet you at that spot tomorrow. 
###LYSANDER
Keep your promise, my love. Look, here comes Helena. 
## HELENA enters.
###HERMIA
Hello, beautiful Helena! Where are you going? 
###HELENA
Did you just call me “beautiful”? Take it back. You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned. Oh, you’re so lucky! Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime. Sickness is contagious—I wish beauty were contagious too! I would catch your good looks before I left. My ear would be infected by your voice, my eye by your eye, and my tongue would come down with a bad case of your melodious speech. If the world were mine, I’d give it all up—everything except Demetrius—to be you. 
Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you. 
###HERMIA
I frown at him, but he still loves me. 
###HELENA
Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns! 
###HERMIA
I curse him, but he loves me. 
###HELENA
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection! 
###HERMIA
The more I hate him, the more he follows me around. 
###HELENA
The more I love him, the more he hates me. 
###HERMIA
It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena. 
###HELENA
That’s true, it’s your beauty’s fault. I wish I had a fault like that! 
###HERMIA
Don’t worry. He won’t see my face ever again. Lysander and I are running away from here. Before I saw Lysander, Athens seemed like paradise to me. But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell! 
###LYSANDER
Helena, we’ll tell you about our secret plan. Tomorrow night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens. 
###HERMIA
(to HELENA) In the woods where you and I used to lounge around on the pale primroses, telling each other sweet secrets—that’s where Lysander and I will meet. 
From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens. We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers. Goodbye, old friend. Pray for us, and I hope you win over Demetrius!—Keep your promise, Lysander. We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow. 
###LYSANDER
I will, my Hermia. 
## HERMIA exits.
Goodbye, Helena. I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him! 
## LYSANDER exits.
###HELENA
It’s amazing how much happier some people are than others! People throughout Athens think I’m as beautiful as Hermia. But so what? Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters. He refuses to admit what everyone else knows. But even though he’s making a mistake by obsessing over Hermia so much, I’m also making a mistake, since I obsess over him. Love can make worthless things beautiful. When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds. That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind. And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty. That’s why they say love is a child. because it makes such bad choices. Just as boys like to play games by telling lies, Cupid breaks his promises all the time. Before Demetrius ever saw Hermia, he showered me with promises and swore he’d be mine forever. 
But when he got all hot and bothered over Hermia, his promises melted away. I’ll go tell Demetrius that Hermia is running away tomorrow night. He’ll run after her. If he’s grateful to me for this information, it’ll be worth my pain in helping him pursue my rival Hermia. At least I’ll get to see him when he goes, and then again when he comes back. 
## HERMIA exits.
## QUINCE, the carpenter, enters with SNUG, the cabinetmaker; BOTTOM, the weaver; FLUTE, the bellows-repairman; SNOUT, the handyman; and STARVELING, the tailor.
###QUINCE
Is everyone here? 
###BOTTOM
You should call their names generally, one person at a time, in the order in which their names appear on this piece of paper. 
###QUINCE
This is a list of the names of all the men in Athens who are good enough to act in the play we’re going to perform for the duke and duchess on their wedding night. 
###BOTTOM
First, Peter Quince, tell us what the play is about, then read the names of the actors, and then shut up. 
###QUINCE
All right. Our play is called A Very Tragic Comedy About the Horrible Deaths of Pyramus and Thisbe. 
###BOTTOM
Let me tell you, it’s a great piece of work, and very—funny.—Now, Peter Quince, call the names of the actors on the list. Men, gather around him. 
###QUINCE
Answer when I call your name.—Nick Bottom, the weaver? 
###BOTTOM
Here. Tell me which part I’m going to play, then go on. 
###QUINCE
You, Nick Bottom, have been cast as Pyramus. 
###BOTTOM
What’s Pyramus? A lover or a tyrant? 
###QUINCE
A lover who kills himself very nobly for love. 
###BOTTOM
I’ll have to cry to make my performance believable. And as soon as I start crying, oh boy, the audience had better watch out, because they’ll start crying too. I’ll make tears pour out of their eyes like rainstorms. I’ll moan very believably.—Name the other actors.—But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant. I could do a great job with Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving. I would rant and rave really well. Like this, listen.  The raging rocks  nd shivering shocks  Will break the locks  Of prison gates.  And the sun-god’s car  Will shine from far  Away, and make and mar  Foolish fate. Oh, that was truly inspired!—Now tell us who the other actors are.—By the way, my performance just now was in the style of Hercules, the tyrant style. A lover would have to be weepier, of course. 
###QUINCE
Francis Flute, the bellows-repairman? 
###FLUTE
Here, Peter Quince. 
###QUINCE
Flute, you’ll be playing the role of Thisbe. 
###FLUTE
Who’s Thisbe? A knight on a quest? 
###QUINCE
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with. 
###FLUTE
No, come on, don’t make me play a woman. I’m growing a beard. 
###QUINCE
That doesn’t matter. You’ll wear a mask, and you can make your voice as high as you want to. 
###BOTTOM
In that case, if I can wear a mask, let me play Thisbe too! I’ll be Pyramus first: “Thisne, Thisne!”—And then in falsetto: “Ah, Pyramus, my dear lover! I’m your dear Thisbe, your dear lady!” 
###QUINCE
No, no. Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe. 
###BOTTOM
All right. Go on. 
###QUINCE
Robin Starveling, the tailor? 
###STARVELING
Here, Peter Quince. 
###QUINCE
Robin Starveling, you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the handyman. 
###SNOUT
Here, Peter Quince. 
###QUINCE
You’ll be Pyramus’s father—I’ll play Thisbe’s father myself—Snug, the cabinetmaker, you’ll play the part of the lion.—So that’s everyone. I hope this play is well cast now. 
###SNUG
Do you have the lion’s part written down? If you do, please give it to me, because I need to start learning the lines. It takes me a long time to learn things. 
###QUINCE
You can improvise the whole thing. It’s just roaring. 
###BOTTOM
Let me play the lion too. I’ll roar so well that it’ll be an inspiration to anyone who hears me. I’ll roar so well that the duke will say, “Let him roar again. Let him roar again.” 
###QUINCE
If you roar too ferociously, you’ll scare the duchess and the other ladies and make them scream. And that would get us all executed. 
###ALL
Yeah, that would get every single one of us executed. 
###BOTTOM
Well, my friends, you’ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies, they’d have no choice but to execute us. But I’ll soften my voice—you know, aggravate it, so to speak—so that I’ll roar as gently as a baby dove. I’ll roar like a sweet, peaceful nightingale. 
###QUINCE
You can’t play any part except Pyramus. Because Pyramus is a good-looking man, the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day, a lovely gentlemanly man. So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus. 
###BOTTOM
Well then, I’ll do it. What kind of beard should I wear for the part? 
###QUINCE
Whatever kind you want, I guess. 
###BOTTOM
I’ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin. 
###QUINCE
Some French people don’t have beards at all, because syphilis has made all their hair fall out, so you might have to play the part clean-shaven.—But gentlemen, here are your scripts, and I beg you to please learn them by tomorrow night. Meet me in the duke’s forest a mile outside of town. It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play. Meanwhile, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play. Now make sure you show up, all of you. Don’t leave me in the lurch. 
###BOTTOM
We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely. Work hard, know your lines. Goodbye. 
###QUINCE
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest. 
###BOTTOM
Got it? Be there, or don’t show your face again. 
##They all exit.
##A FAIRY and ROBIN GOODFELLOW (a “puck” or mischievous spirit) meet onstage.
###ROBIN
Hello, spirit! Where are you going? 
###FAIRY
I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire. I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth. I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass. The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards. You’ll see that their petals have spots on them—those are rubies, fairy gifts. Their sweet smells come from those little freckles. Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower. Goodbye, you dumb old spirit. I’ve got to go. The queen and her elves will be here soon. 
###ROBIN
The king’s having a party here tonight. Just make sure the queen doesn’t come anywhere near him, because King Oberon is extremely angry. He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king. She’s never kidnapped such a darling human child before, and Oberon’s jealous. He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests. But the queen refuses to hand the boy over to Oberon. Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him. 
And now Oberon and Titania refuse to speak to each other, or meet each other anywhere—neither in the forest nor on the plain, nor by the river nor under the stars. They always argue, and the little fairies get so frightened that they hide in acorn cups and won’t come out. 
###FAIRY
Unless I’m mistaken, you’re that mischievous and naughty spirit named Robin Goodfellow. Aren’t you the one who goes around scaring the maidens in the village, stealing the cream from the top of the milk, screwing up the flour mills, and frustrating housewives by keeping their milk from turning into butter? Aren’t you the one who keeps beer from foaming up as it should, and causes people to get lost at night, while you laugh at them? Some people call you “Hobgoblin” and “sweet Puck,” and you’re nice to them. You do their work for them and give them good luck. That’s you, right? 
###ROBIN
What you say is true. That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night. I tell jokes to Oberon and make him smile. I’ll trick a fat, well-fed horse into thinking that I’m a young female horse. Sometimes I hide at the bottom of an old woman’s drink disguised as an apple. When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck. Sometimes a wise old woman with a sad story to tell tries to sit down on me, thinking I’m a three-legged stool. But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun. But step aside, fairy! Here comes Oberon. 
###FAIRY
And here’s my mistress, Titania. I wish he’d go away! 
## OBERON, the Fairy King, and his followers enter. On the opposite side of the stage, TITANIA, the Fairy Queen, and her followers enter.
###OBERON
How not nice to see you, Titania. 
###TITANIA
What, are you jealous, Oberon?—Fairies, let’s get out of here. I’ve sworn I’ll never sleep with him or talk to him again. 
###OBERON
Wait just a minute, you brazen hussy. Aren’t you supposed to obey me, your lord and husband? 
###TITANIA
If you’re my lord and husband, I must be your lady and wife, so you’re supposed to be faithful to me. But I know for a fact that you snuck away from Fairyland disguised as a shepherd, and spent all day playing straw pipes and singing love poems to your new girlfriend. The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta. She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover, and now that she’s getting married to Theseus, you’ve come to celebrate their marriage. 
###OBERON
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta, when you know that I know about your love for Theseus? Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night, right after he’d raped her? And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends, like Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa? 
###TITANIA
These are nothing but jealous lies. Since the beginning of midsummer, my fairies and I haven’t been able to meet anywhere to do our dances in the wind without being disturbed by you and your arguments. We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us. And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you. So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe. Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep. All the fields where people usually play games are filled with mud, and you can’t even see the elaborate mazes that people create in the grass, because no one walks in them anymore and they’ve all grown over. It’s not winter here for the human mortals, so they’re not protected by the holy hymns and carols that they sing in winter. So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases. As a consequence of this bad weather and these bad moods the seasons have started to change. Cold frosts spread over the red roses, and the icy winter wears a crown of sweet summer flowers as some sick joke. Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which. And this is all because of our argument. We are responsible for this. 
###OBERON
Do something about it, then. You have the power to fix it. Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon? All I’m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew. 
###TITANIA
Get over it. I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland. His mother was one of my worshippers, and we always used to gossip together at night in India, sitting together by the ocean and watching the merchant ships sailing on the ocean. We used to laugh to see the sails fill up with wind so that they looked like they had big, pregnant bellies, as if the wind had gotten them pregnant. She would imitate them—since she was already pregnant with the little boy—and she would go sailing over the land herself to go get me little presents, and come back carrying gifts like she was a ship coming back from a voyage. But since she was a mortal, she died giving birth to that boy, and for her sake I’m raising him and will not give him up. 
###OBERON
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest? 
###TITANIA
Maybe until after Theseus’s wedding day. If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations, then you can come with us. If not, leave me alone, and I’ll stay away from your turf. 
###OBERON
Give me that boy and I’ll come with you. 
###TITANIA
Not for your entire fairy kingdom.—Come, fairies, let’s go. We’re going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer. 
## TITANIA and her FAIRIES exit.
###OBERON
Well, go on your way, then. You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult. (to ROBIN GOODFELLOW) My dear Puck, come here. You remember the time when I was sitting on a cliff, and I heard a mermaid sitting on a dolphin’s back sing such a sweet and harmonious song that it calmed the stormy sea and made stars shoot out of the sky so they could hear her better? 
###ROBIN
Yes, I remember. 
###OBERON
That same night, I saw Cupid flying from the moon to the earth, with all of his arrows ready. (You couldn’t see him, but I could.) He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts. But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love. But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell. It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love. Young girls call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that flower. I showed it to you once. If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees. Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles. 
###ROBIN
I could go around the world in forty minutes. 
## ROBIN exits.
###OBERON
When I have the juice of that flower, I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping. She’ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up—even if it’s a lion, a bear, a wolf, a bull, a monkey, or an ape. And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page. But who’s that coming this way? I’ll make myself invisible and listen to their conversation. 
## DEMETRIUS enters, followed by HELENA.
###DEMETRIUS
Look, I don’t love you, so stop following me around. Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia? Lysander I want to stop, but Hermia stops my heart from beating. You told me they escaped into this forest. And here I am, going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia. Go away, get out of here, and stop following me. 
###HELENA
You attract me to you, you cruel magnet! But you must not attract iron, because my heart is as true as steel. If you let go of your power to attract me, I won’t have any power to follow you. 
###DEMETRIUS
Do I ask you to follow me? Do I speak to you kindly? Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you? 
###HELENA
Yes, but that makes me love you even more. I’m your little dog, Demetrius. The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you. Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me. Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you. Could I ask for a worse place in your heart than to be treated as you would treat a dog? And yet I would consider it an honor to be your dog. 
###DEMETRIUS
Don’t push it. Just looking at you makes me sick. 
###HELENA
And I get sick when I can’t look at you. 
###DEMETRIUS
You’re risking your reputation by leaving the city and stalking someone who doesn’t love you. Standing around alone in a deserted area in the middle of the night isn’t the best way to protect your virginity. 
###HELENA
I rely on your virtue to protect me. And because I can see your shining face, it doesn’t feel like nighttime to me. This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here, because you are all the world to me. So how can anyone say I’m alone, when the whole world is here to look at me? 
###DEMETRIUS
I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild animals. 
###HELENA
The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are. Run whenever you want to. The story of Daphne and Apollo will be changed: 
the lustful god Apollo runs away from the virginal nymph Daphne who pursues him, the dove chases after the griffin, which is usually its predator, and the gentle deer tries to hunt down the tiger—speed is useless when the cowardly person chases and the brave person runs away. 
###DEMETRIUS
I’m not sticking around to listen to you any longer. Leave me alone. Or if you follow me, you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest. 
###HELENA
Yes, you already hurt me in the church, in the town, and in the fields. Shame on you, Demetrius! Your behavior is an insult to all women. We cannot fight for love as men can. We should be pursued and courted. We weren’t made to do the pursuing. 
## DEMETRIUS exits.
I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven. It would be heavenly to be killed by someone I love so much. 
## HELENA exits.
###OBERON
Goodbye, nymph. Before he leaves this part of the forest, you’ll change places: you’ll be the one running away, and he’ll be in love with you. 
## ROBIN enters.
Do you have the flower? Welcome, traveler. 
###ROBIN
Yes, here it is. 
###OBERON
Please, give it to me. (he takes the flower from ROBIN) I know a place where wild thyme blooms, and oxlips and violets grow. It’s covered over with luscious honeysuckle, sweet muskroses and sweetbrier. 
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights. Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in. I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires. (he gives ROBIN part of the flower) You take some of it too, and look around in this part of the forest. A sweet Athenian lady is in love with a young man who wants nothing to do with her. Put some of this flower’s juice on his eyes, and make sure to do it in such a way that the next thing he sees will be the lady. You’ll be able to tell it’s him because he’s wearing Athenian clothes. Do it carefully, so that he’ll end up loving her more than she loves him. And then make sure to meet me before the rooster’s first crow at dawn. 
###ROBIN
Don’t worry, sir. I’m at your service. 
##They all exit, separately.
## TITANIA, the Fairy Queen, enters with her following of FAIRIES.
###TITANIA
Come, dance in a circle and sing a fairy song, and then go off for a while to do your work. Some of you will kill the worms infesting the rosebuds, some of you will fight with bats to get their leathery wings, so we can make coats for my small elves. Some of you will keep that loud owl away, the one that hoots and wonders every night at us dainty fairies. Sing me to sleep now, and then go off to do your duties and let me rest. 
##The FAIRIES sing.
###FIRST FAIRY
(singing)  Snakes with forked tongues,  And porcupines, don’t be seen.  Deadly lizards, don’t be mean.  Don’t come near our fairy queen. 
###FAIRIES
(singing)  Nightingale, melodiously  Sing our sweet lullaby.  Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.  Let no harm  Or spell or charm  Come near our lovely lady.  Say good night with a lullaby. 
###FIRST FAIRY
(singing)  Spiders with your webs, stay away.  You long-legged things, begone! 
 Black beetles, don’t come near.  Worms and snails, don’t be bad. 
###FAIRIES
(singing)  Nightingale, melodiously  Sing our sweet lullaby.  Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.  Let no harm  Or spell or charm  Come near our lovely lady.  Say good night with a lullaby. 
## TITANIA falls asleep.
###SECOND FAIRY
Okay, let’s go! Everything’s fine now. One of us will stay and stand guard. 
##The FAIRIES exit.
## OBERON enters.
###OBERON
(he squeezes flower juice on TITANIA ’s eyelids) Whatever you see first when you wake up, think of it as your true love. Love him and yearn for him, even if he’s a lynx, a cat, a bear, a leopard, or a wild boar. Whatever’s there when you wake up will be dear to you. Wake up when something nasty is nearby. 
## OBERON exits.
## LYSANDER and HERMIA enter.
###LYSANDER
My love, you look like you’re about to faint from wandering in the woods for so long, and to tell you the truth, I’ve gotten us lost. 
We’ll take a rest, if you think it’s a good idea, and wait until daylight when things will be easier. 
###HERMIA
Let’s do that, Lysander. Find something to cushion you while you sleep. I’m going to rest my head on this little slope. 
###LYSANDER
We can both sleep together on the grass. We’ll have one heart, one bed, two bodies, and one faithful vow. 
###HERMIA
No, Lysander. Please, for my sake, sleep a little farther away. Don’t sleep so close to me. 
###LYSANDER
Oh, sweetheart, I didn’t mean anything naughty when I said that. When lovers talk to each other, their hearts should understand each other. I just meant that our hearts are joined, so we can almost think of them as one heart. Our two bodies are linked together by the promises we’ve made to each other, so there are two bodies and one faithful vow. So let me sleep next to you. If I lie next to you, I won’t lie to you—I’ll be faithful and respect you. 
###HERMIA
Lysander’s got a way with words. I would certainly be rude and shameful if I had implied that you were a liar. But please, darling, sleep a little farther away so we can behave properly. It’s only proper for a well-behaved bachelor and a well-behaved girl to be physically separated like this. Stay away for now, and good night, my sweet friend. I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life! 
###LYSANDER
Amen to that. I hope my life ends before my loyalty to you does. I’ll sleep over here. Sleep well! 
###HERMIA
You sleep well too. 
## HERMIA and LYSANDER sleep. ROBIN enters.
##
###ROBIN
I’ve been through the entire forest, but I haven’t found any Athenian man to use the flower on. (he sees LYSANDER and HERMIA) Wait a second, who’s this? He’s wearing Athenian clothes. This must be the guy who rejected the Athenian girl. And here’s the girl, sleeping soundly on the damp and dirty ground. Pretty girl! She shouldn’t lie near this rude and heartless man. (he puts flower juice on LYSANDER ’s eyelids) Jerk, I throw all the power of this magic charm on your eyes. When you wake up, let love keep you from going back to sleep. Wake up when I’m gone, because now I have to go to Oberon. 
## ROBIN exits.
## DEMETRIUS and HELENA enter, running.
###HELENA
Stop, Demetrius! Stop, even if only to kill me. 
###DEMETRIUS
I’m telling you, get out of here, and don’t follow me around like this. 
###HELENA
Oh, will you leave me alone in the dark? Don’t. 
###DEMETRIUS
Stay here at your own risk. I’m going on alone. 
## DEMETRIUS exits.
###HELENA
Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase. The more I pray, the less I get out of it. Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes. How did her eyes get so bright? Not from crying. If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers. No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror. So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster. What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes? (she sees LYSANDER) But who’s this here? Lysander, on the ground? Is he dead or sleeping? I don’t see any blood or injuries—Lysander, if you’re alive, wake up. 
###LYSANDER
(waking up) I’d even run through fire if you told me to. Radiant, beautiful Helena! I feel like Mother Nature has allowed me to see into your heart, as if by magic. Where is Demetrius? Oh, I’d kill that name with my sword if I could! 
###HELENA
Don’t say that, Lysander. Don’t say that. Why do you care that he loves Hermia? What does it matter? Hermia still loves you, so be happy. 
###LYSANDER
Happy with Hermia? No. I regret all the boring time I wasted with her. I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena. Who wouldn’t love a dove more than a crow? A man’s desires are influenced by his logical mind, and it’s simply logical that you’re more worthy of love than Hermia is. 
Fruits and vegetables don’t ripen until the right season of the year. Likewise, I’m young, and my sense of reason has just ripened. I can finally see the light. My logic has more control over my desires than it used to, and it’s telling me to look into your eyes, where I see every love story ever told. 
###HELENA
Why does everyone always make fun of me? What have I done to deserve this kind of treatment from you? Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man, that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius? Do you have to harp on my inadequacy? My God, it’s wrong for you to woo me in such a cruel, disdainful way. But goodbye. I have to tell you, I thought you were a much kinder person than this. Oh, how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one! 
## HELENA exits.
###LYSANDER
She doesn’t see Hermia—Hermia, keep sleeping, and don’t come near me ever again! Eating too many sweets makes people sick to their stomachs, and people always hate the mistakes they made in the past worse than anyone else hates those mistakes. Hermia, you’re the sweet I’ve had too much of, and the mistake I used to make, so I hate you more than anyone else does.—I’ll use all my talents and efforts to serve Helen and bring her honor. 
## LYSANDER exits.
###HERMIA
(waking up) Help me, Lysander, help me! Get this snake off of my chest. Oh, my God! What a terrible dream I just had! Lysander, look how I’m shaking from fear. I thought a snake was eating my heart while you sat smiling and watching. Lysander!—What, is he gone?—Lysander, my lord!—What, is he out of earshot? Gone? No answer, nothing? Oh, God, where are you? Say something if you can hear me. Say something, please! I’m almost fainting with fear. Nothing? Then I guess you’re nowhere nearby. I’ll find you—or die—right away. 
## HERMIA exits.
##While TITANIA is asleep onstage, the clowns—BOTTOM, QUINCE, FLUTE, SNUG, SNOUT, and STARVELING—enter.
###BOTTOM
Are we all here? 
###QUINCE
Right on time. This is the perfect place to rehearse. This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room. Let’s put on our play exactly as we’ll perform it for the duke. 
###BOTTOM
Peter Quince— 
###QUINCE
What is it, jolly Bottom? 
###BOTTOM
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work. First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand. What should we do about that? 
###SNOUT
By God, that’s a real problem, it’s true. 
###STARVELING
I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it. 
###BOTTOM
Not at all! I’ve got a plan that will fix everything. Write me a prologue that I can recite to the audience before the play starts. I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead. And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver. That’ll keep them from being afraid. 
###QUINCE
All right, we’ll have a prologue then. We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad. 
###BOTTOM
No, add a couple more syllables. Make it eight and eight. 
###SNOUT
Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion? 
###STARVELING
I’m really worried about that. 
###BOTTOM
Sirs, you ought to think to yourself, bringing in—God forbid!—a lion amongst ladies is really terrible. There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion, and we should remember that. 
###SNOUT
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion. 
###BOTTOM
No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself. He should say the following, or something else to the same defect—“Ladies,” or “Lovely ladies,” “I would like to ask you” or “I would like to request of you” or “I would like to beg you” “not to be afraid, and not to tremble with fear. I value your lives as highly as my own. If you thought I was a real lion, I would be risking my life. But no, I am not at all a lion. I am a man, just like other men.” And then he should say his name, and tell them plainly that he’s Snug the carpenter. 
###QUINCE
All right, that’s what we’ll do then. But there are two things we still have to figure out. How are we going to bring moonlight into a room? Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight. 
###SNOUT
Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play? 
###BOTTOM
We need a calendar! Look in the almanac. Look up moonshine, look up moonshine! 
###QUINCE
(he takes out a book) Yes, the moon will shine that night. 
###BOTTOM
Well then, you can leave one of the windows open in the big hall where we’ll be performing, and the moon can shine in through the window. 
###QUINCE
Yes, or else someone will have to come in carrying a bundle of sticks and a lantern and say he’s come to disfigure, or represent, the character of Moonshine, because the man in the moon is supposed to carry sticks and a lantern. But there’s still another problem: we need to have a wall in the big hall, because according to the story, Pyramus and Thisbe talked through a little hole in a wall. 
###SNOUT
You’ll never be able to bring in a wall. What do you think, Bottom? 
###BOTTOM
Someone should play the part of Wall. He can have some plaster or clay or limestone or something on him to show the audience he’s a wall. He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack. 
###QUINCE
If we can do that, everything will be all right. Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start. When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage. 
## ROBIN enters, unseen by the characters onstage.
###ROBIN
(to himself) Who are these country bumpkins swaggering around so close to where the fairy queen is sleeping? What? Are they about to put on a play? I’ll watch. And I’ll act in it, too, if I feel like it. 
###QUINCE
Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, come forward. 
###BOTTOM
(as PYRAMUS) Thisbe, flowers with sweet odious smells— 
###QUINCE
“Odors,” “odors.” 
###BOTTOM
(as PYRAMUS) —odors and smells are like your breath, my dearest Thisbe dear. But what’s that, a voice! Wait here a while. I’ll be right back! 
## BOTTOM exits.
###ROBIN
(to himself) That’s the strangest Pyramus I’ve ever seen. 
## ROBIN exits.
###FLUTE
Am I supposed to talk now? 
###QUINCE
Yes, you are. You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back. 
###FLUTE
(as THISBE) Most radiant Pyramus, you are as white as a lily, and the color of a red rose on a splendid rosebush, a very lively young man and also a lovely Jew. You are as reliable as a horse that never gets tired. I’ll meet you, Pyramus, at Ninny’s grave. 
###QUINCE
That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man. And don’t say all of that yet. You’re supposed to say some of it as a reply to Pyramus. You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter. You missed your cue. It’s “never get tired.” 
###FLUTE
Oh! (as THISBE) As reliable as a horse that never gets tired. 
## ROBIN enters with BOTTOM, with a donkey’s head instead of a human head.
###BOTTOM
(as PYRAMUS) If I were handsome, my lovely Thisbe, I would still want only you. 
###QUINCE
Help! It’s a monster! We’re being haunted. Run, everyone, run! 
## QUINCE, FLUTE, SNUG, SNOUT, and STARVELING exit.
###ROBIN
I’ll follow you. I’ll run you around in circles, through bogs and bushes and woods and thorns. Sometimes I’ll take the shape of a horse, sometimes I’ll take the shape of a hound or a pig or a headless bear. Sometimes I’ll turn into fire! And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn. 
## ROBIN exits.
###BOTTOM
Why are they running away? This is some joke of theirs to scare me. 
## SNOUT enters.
###SNOUT
Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed! What have you got on your head? 
###BOTTOM
What do you think I’ve got on my head? You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think? 
## SNOUT exits.
## QUINCE enters.
###QUINCE
God bless you, Bottom, God bless you. You’ve been changed. Reborn. 
## QUINCE exits.
###BOTTOM
I see what they’re up to. They want to make an ass of me, to scare me if they can. But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do. I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid. (singing)  The blackbird with its black feathers  And its orange-and-tan beak,  The thrush with its clear voice,  The wren with its small, piping chirp— 
###TITANIA
(waking up) What angel is this who’s waking me up from my bed of flowers? 
###BOTTOM
(singing)  The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,  The gray cuckoo with his simple song  That many men hear  But they don’t dare say no to it— 
Of course they don’t say “no”! Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird? Who’d bother to accuse a bird of lying, even if the bird were telling him that his wife was cheating on him? 
###TITANIA
Please sing again, sweet human. I love to listen to your voice, and I love to look at your body. I know this is the first time I’ve ever seen you, but you’re so wonderful that I can’t help swearing to you that I love you. 
###BOTTOM
I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me. But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days. It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them. Ha, ha! No, I’m just kidding. 
###TITANIA
You’re as wise as you are beautiful. 
###BOTTOM
No, that’s not true. But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest, I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself. 
###TITANIA
Don’t bother wishing you could leave this forest, because you’re going to stay here whether you want to or not. I’m no ordinary fairy. I rule over the summer, and I love you. So come with me. I’ll give you fairies as servants, and they’ll bring you jewels from the depths of the ocean, and sing to you while you sleep on a bed of flowers. And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed! 
##Four fairies—PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED—enter.
###PEASEBLOSSOM
Ready. 
###COBWEB
Me too. 
###MOTH
Me too. 
###MUSTARDSEED
And me too. 
###ALL
Where should we go? 
###TITANIA
Be kind and polite to this gentleman. Follow him around. Leap and dance for him. Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal honey from the bumblebees, and make candles out of the bees' wax. Light them with the light of glowworms, so my love will have light when he goes to bed and wakes up. Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps. Bow to him, fairies, and curtsy to him. 
###PEASEBLOSSOM
Hello, mortal! 
###COBWEB
Hello! 
###MOTH
Hello! 
###MUSTARDSEED
Hello! 
###BOTTOM
I beg your pardon, sirs.—Please tell me your name, sir? 
###COBWEB
Cobweb. 
###BOTTOM
I’d like to get to know you better, Mr. Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding.—And your name, sir? 
###PEASEBLOSSOM
Peaseblossom. 
###BOTTOM
Please, give my regards to your mother, Mrs. Peapod, and your father, Mr. Peapod. Good Mr. Peaseblossom, I’d like to get to know you better too.—And you, may I ask what your name is, sir? 
###MUSTARDSEED
Mustardseed. 
###BOTTOM
Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well. Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef. I swear to you, many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before. I look forward to getting to know you better, Mr. Mustardseed. 
###TITANIA
Take good care of him. Take him to my sleeping area. The moon looks sad to me. When she cries, all the little flowers cry too. They’re sad because someone is prevented from having sex—or is having it against her will. Keep my lover quiet. Bring him to me in silence. 
##They all exit.
## OBERON, the Fairy King, enters.
###OBERON
I wonder if Titania is awake yet, and if she is, I wonder what the first thing she saw was. Whatever it is, she must be completely in love with it now. 
## ROBIN enters.
Ah, here comes my messenger.—What’s going on, you crazy spirit? What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest? 
###ROBIN
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster. While she was sleeping in her bed of flowers, a group of bumbling idiots, rough workmen from Athens, got together nearby to rehearse some play they plan to perform on Theseus’s wedding day. The stupidest one, who played Pyramus in their play, finished his scene and went to sit in the bushes to wait for his next cue. I took that opportunity to stick a donkey’s head on him. When it was time for him to go back onstage and talk to his Thisbe, he came out of the bushes and everyone saw him. His friends ran away as fast as ducks scatter when they hear a hunter’s gunshot. One of them was so frightened when he heard my footsteps that he yelled, “Murder!” and called for help from Athens. They were all so afraid that they completely lost their common sense. They started to become scared of inanimate objects, terrified by the thorns and briars that catch at their clothing and pull off their sleeves and hats. I led them on in this frightened, distracted state, and left sweet 
Pyramus there, transformed into someone with a donkey’s head. At that exact moment, Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him, an ass. 
###OBERON
This is going even better than I planned. But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do? 
###ROBIN
Yes, I found him when he was asleep—so that’s taken care of too—and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him. When he woke up, he must have seen her. 
## DEMETRIUS and HERMIA enter.
###OBERON
(speaking so that only ROBIN can hear) Step aside. Here’s the Athenian coming now. 
###ROBIN
(speaking so that only OBERON can hear) That’s definitely the woman I saw, but it’s not the same man. 
###DEMETRIUS
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much? Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy. 
###HERMIA
I’m only scolding you now, but I should treat you much worse, because I’m afraid you’ve given me good reason to curse you. If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood. You might as well jump right into a bloodbath and kill me, too. 
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime. Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep? I’ll believe that when I believe that there’s a hole through the center of the earth, and the moon has passed all the way through to the other side. The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him. A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim. 
###DEMETRIUS
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look. You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky. 
###HERMIA
What does that have to do with my Lysander? Where is he? Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me? 
###DEMETRIUS
I would rather feed his corpse to my dogs. 
###HERMIA
Get out, dog! You’ve driven me to my wit’s end. Did you kill him, then? From now on I won’t even consider you a human being. Oh, just tell the truth for once. tell the truth, if only for my sake.—Would you have even dared to look at him when he was awake? And did you kill him while he was sleeping? Oh, how brave of you! A snake could do that as easily as you could. A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have. 
###DEMETRIUS
You’re getting all worked up over a misunderstanding. I didn’t kill Lysander. ?As far as I know, he’s not even dead. 
###HERMIA
Then please tell me he’s all right. 
###DEMETRIUS
If I told you that, what would I get out of it? 
###HERMIA
The privilege of never seeing me again. And now I’m going to leave your despised company. You’ll never see me again, whether or not he’s dead. 
## HERMIA exits.
###DEMETRIUS
I can’t go after her when she’s in a rage like this. So I’ll stay here for a while. Sadness gets worse when you haven’t had enough sleep. I’ll try to sleep a little here. ( DEMETRIUS lies down and falls asleep) 
###OBERON
(to ROBIN) What have you done? You’ve made a mistake and put the love-juice on someone else, someone who was truly in love. Because of your mistake someone’s true love must have turned bad, instead of this man’s false love being turned into a true love. 
###ROBIN
In that case, it must be fate. That’s the way of the world. For every man who’s faithful to his true love, a million end up running after a different lover. 
###OBERON
Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood. Bring her here with some trick or illusion, and I’ll put the charm on his eyes for when she comes. 
###ROBIN
I go, I go, look at me go—faster than an arrow from a Tartar’s bow. 
## ROBIN exits
###OBERON
(putting flower juice on DEMETRIUS ’s eyelids) You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes. When he sees the girl he should love, make her seem as bright to him as the evening star. Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness. 
## ROBIN enters.
###ROBIN
Helena is nearby, boss. The young man who I mistook for this one is there too, begging her to love him. Should we watch this ridiculous scene? Lord, what fools these mortals are! 
###OBERON
Step aside. The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius. 
###ROBIN
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl. That will be funny enough, and preposterous situations are my favorite thing. 
## LYSANDER and HELENA enter.
###LYSANDER
Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you? People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone. 
Look, when I swear that I love you, I cry, and when someone cries while he’s making a promise, he’s usually telling the truth. How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere? 
###HELENA
You get trickier and trickier. You’ve made the same promises to me and to Hermia—they can’t both be true! They must both be false. The promises you’re making to me belong to Hermia. Will you abandon her? If you weighed the promises you made to me against the promises you made to her, they’d come out the same—they both weigh nothing. They’re lies. 
###LYSANDER
I wasn’t thinking clearly when I made those promises to her. 
###HELENA
And I don’t believe you’re thinking clearly now, as you break those promises. 
###LYSANDER
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you. 
###DEMETRIUS
(waking up) Oh Helena, you goddess, you divine and perfect nymph! What can I compare your eyes to? Crystal isn’t as clear as they are. Oh, your lips are as ripe as a pair of tempting cherries touching each other! The pure white of the snow on a mountaintop seems black as a crow’s wing next to the whiteness of your hands. Oh, let me kiss your beautiful white hand. It’ll make me so happy! 
###HELENA
Damn it! I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs. If you had any manners at all, you wouldn’t treat me like this. Can’t you just hate me, as I know you do? Do you have to get together to humiliate me too? If you were real men, as you pretend to be, you wouldn’t treat a lady this way, making vows and promises and praising my beauty when I know you’re really both disgusted by me. You’re competing for 
Hermia’s love, and now you’re competing to see which one of you can make fun of me the most. That’s a great idea, a really manly thing to do—making a poor girl cry! No respectable person would offend an innocent girl just to have some fun. 
###LYSANDER
Don’t be cruel, Demetrius. I know you love Hermia, and you know I know it. Right here, right now, I swear I’m giving up all my claims on her and handing her to you. In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die. 
###HELENA
Nobody’s ever gone to so much trouble just to make fun of someone. 
###DEMETRIUS
Lysander, keep your Hermia. I don’t want her. If I ever loved her, all that love is gone now. My love for her was temporary. Now I’ll love Helena forever. 
###LYSANDER
Helena, it’s not true. 
###DEMETRIUS
Don’t insult a deep love that you don’t understand, or you’ll pay the price. Look, here comes the woman you love. 
## HERMIA enters.
###HERMIA
It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well. 
I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you. Why did you leave me alone so unkindly? 
###LYSANDER
Why stay when love tells you to go? 
###HERMIA
But what love could make my Lysander leave me? 
###LYSANDER
I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars. Why are you looking for me? Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you? 
###HERMIA
You can’t mean what you’re saying. It’s impossible. 
###HELENA
So, she’s in on this too! Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me. Hurtful Hermia, you ungrateful girl, have you conspired with these two to provoke me with this horrible teasing? Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together, the vows we made to be like sisters to one another, all the hours we spent together, wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten? Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence? We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together. We grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem. 
We seemed to have two separate bodies, but we had one heart. Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend? It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike. All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it. 
###HERMIA
I’m completely dumbfounded by what you’re saying. I’m not insulting you. It sounds more like you’re insulting me. 
###HELENA
Come on, confess. Didn’t you send Lysander, as an insult, to follow me around praising my eyes and my face? Haven’t you made your other love, Demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine, rare, precious, heavenly creature? Why does he talk like that to a girl he can’t stand? And why does Lysander deny that he loves you, when he loves you so deeply? Why would he show me any affection, unless you told him to? Why does it matter that I’m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited? You should pity me for that reason, not hate me. 
###HERMIA
I don’t know what you’re talking about. 
###HELENA
Oh, fine. All right, go ahead, keep up your little game, pretend to be sympathetic, but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back. Keep up your wonderful game. You’re doing such a good job on this trick, someone should write a book about it. 
If you had any sense of pity, or manners, you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this. But goodbye. It’s partly my own fault, since I followed you here. Leaving—or dying—will soon take care of everything. 
###LYSANDER
Stay, lovely Helena. Listen to my excuse. My love, my life, my soul, beautiful Helena! 
###HELENA
That’s a good one. 
###HERMIA
(to LYSANDER) Don’t insult her like that, Lysander darling. 
###DEMETRIUS
(to LYSANDER) If Hermia’s begging can’t make you stop insulting Helena, I can force you to do so. 
###LYSANDER
You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me. Your threats are no stronger than her whining.—Helena, I love you. I swear I do. I’ll give my life for you, just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don’t love you. 
###DEMETRIUS
I say that I love you more than he does. 
###LYSANDER
If that’s what you say, go fight a duel with me and prove it. 
###DEMETRIUS
You’re on. Let’s do it. 
###HERMIA
Lysander, where are you going with all this? 
##(she holds LYSANDER back)
###LYSANDER
(to HERMIA) Get away, you African! 
###DEMETRIUS
(to HERMIA) No, no. He’ll act like he’s going to break free from you, Hermia. 
(to LYSANDER) Pretend like you’re going to follow me, but then don’t come. You’re a coward, get out of here! 
###LYSANDER
(to HERMIA) Stop hanging on me, you cat, you thorn. Let go of me, or I’ll shake you off like a snake. 
###HERMIA
Why have you gotten so rude? What’s happened to you, my darling? 
###LYSANDER
Your darling? Get out, you dark-skinned gypsy! Get out, you horrible poison. Get out! 
###HERMIA
Are you joking? 
###HELENA
Of course he is, and so are you. 
###LYSANDER
Demetrius, I’m ready to fight you as promised. 
###DEMETRIUS
I wish we had a signed legal contract. I can see you don’t keep your promises very well. I don’t trust you. 
###LYSANDER
What? Do you want me to hit Hermia, hurt her, kill her? Sure, I hate her, but I wouldn’t hurt her. 
###HERMIA
(to LYSANDER) Can you hurt me any more than by saying you hate me? Hate me? Why? What’s happened to you, my love? Am I not Hermia? Aren’t you Lysander? I’m as beautiful now as I was a little while ago. You still loved me when we fell asleep, but when you woke up you left me. So you left me—Oh, God help me!—For real? 
###LYSANDER
I certainly did, and I never wanted to see you again. So stop hoping and wondering what I mean. 
I’ve spelled it out for you clearly. It’s no joke. I hate you and love Helena. 
###HERMIA
Oh, no! (to HELENA) You trickster, you snake! You thief! What, did you sneak in at night and steal my love’s heart from him? 
###HELENA
Oh, that’s very nice! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You’re going to make me mad enough to answer you? Damn you, you faker, you puppet! 
###HERMIA
“Puppet”? Why “puppet”?—Oh, I see where this is going. She’s talking about our difference in height. She’s paraded in front of him to show off how tall she is. She won him over with her height.—Does he have such a high opinion of you because I’m so short? Is that it? So how short am I, you painted barber pole? Tell me. How short am I? I’m not too short to gouge your eyes out with my fingernails. 
###HELENA
(to LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS) Please don’t let her hurt me, gentlemen, however much you want to tease me. I never was much good with insults. I’m not mean and catty like her. I’m a nice shy girl. Please don’t let her hit me. Maybe you think that because she’s shorter than me I can take her. 
###HERMIA
“Shorter!” See, she’s doing it again! 
###HELENA
Good Hermia, please don’t act so bitter toward me. I always loved you, Hermia, and gave you advice. I never did anything to hurt you—except once, when I told Demetrius that you planned to sneak off into this forest. And I only did that because I loved Demetrius so much. He followed you. And I followed him because I loved him. But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me, kick me—even kill me. Now just let me go quietly back to Athens. I’ll carry my mistakes back with me. I won’t follow you anymore. Please let me go. You see how naïve and foolish I’ve been. 
###HERMIA
Well, get out of here then! What’s keeping you? 
###HELENA
My stupid heart, which I’m leaving behind here. 
###HERMIA
What, you’re leaving it with Lysander? 
###HELENA
No, with Demetrius. 
###LYSANDER
Don’t be afraid. She can’t hurt you, Helena. 
###DEMETRIUS
(to LYSANDER) That’s right, Hermia won’t hurt Helena even if you try to help her. 
###HELENA
Oh, when you get her angry, she’s a good fighter, and vicious too. She was a hellcat in school. And she’s fierce, even though she’s little. 
###HERMIA
“Little” again? Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this? Let me at her!. 
###LYSANDER
(to HERMIA) Get lost, you dwarf, you tiny little weed, you scrap, you acorn! 
###DEMETRIUS
You’re doing too much to defend a woman who wants nothing to do with you. Leave Hermia alone. Don’t talk about Helena. Don’t take Helena’s side. If you continue treating Hermia so badly, you’ll pay for it. 
###LYSANDER
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore. Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena. 
###DEMETRIUS
“Follow”? No, I’ll walk right next to you, side by side. 
## DEMETRIUS and LYSANDER exit.
###HERMIA
All this fighting is because of you. Stay where you are. 
###HELENA
I’m not sticking around here any more. I don’t trust you. You might be a better fighter than I am, but my legs are longer and I can run away faster. 
## HELENA exits.
###HERMIA
I just can’t believe any of this. I don’t know what to say. 
## HERMIA exits.
###OBERON
(to ROBIN) This is all your fault. You make mistakes constantly, or else you cause this kind of trouble on purpose. 
###ROBIN
Believe me, King of Illusions, I made a mistake. Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing? So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do—I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes. And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out, since I find all of this commotion very entertaining. 
###OBERON
As you can see, these lovers are looking for a place to fight. Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy. Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog, as dark as hell, and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other. Imitate Lysander’s voice and egg Demetrius on with insults. Then rant for a while in Demetrius’s voice, and egg Lysander on. That way you’ll get them away from each other until they’re so exhausted that they’ll sleep like the dead. ( OBERON gives a new flower to ROBIN) When they’re asleep, crush some of this flower’s juice into Lysander’s eyes. The flower’s juice has the power to erase all the damage that’s been done to his eyes, and to make him see normally, the way he used to. When they wake up, all this trouble and conflict will seem like a dream or a meaningless vision. Then the lovers will go back to Athens, united together until death. While you’re busy with that, I’ll go see Queen Titania and ask her once again for the Indian boy. And then I’ll undo the spell that I cast over her, so she won’t be in love with that monster anymore. Then everything will be peaceful again. 
###ROBIN
We’ve got to act fast, my lord of the fairies. Night’s fading quickly, and in the distance the morning star is shining, warning us that dawn is coming. At dawn, the ghosts that have been wandering around all night go home to the graveyards. The souls of people who weren’t buried in holy ground, but instead lie rotting by the side of the road or at the bottom of a river, have already gone back to their wormy graves. They weren’t buried in a real graveyard because they committed suicide, and they don’t want their shame to be seen in daylight, so they avoid sunlight and stay forever in the darkness of night. 
###OBERON
But we’re not like that. We’re a different kind of spirit, and we don’t have to run away from the sunlight. I like the morning. I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean, turning the salty green water to gold. But you should hurry anyway. Don’t delay. We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak. 
## OBERON exits.
###ROBIN
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down. The people fear me in the country and the town. Goblin, lead them up and down. Here comes one of them now. 
## LYSANDER enters.
###LYSANDER
Where are you, Demetrius, you arrogant bastard? Say something. 
###ROBIN
(in DEMETRIUS’s voice) I’m over here, you villain, with my sword out and ready to fight. Where are you? 
###LYSANDER
I’m coming. 
###ROBIN
(in DEMETRIUS’s voice) Let’s go to a flatter area where we can fight more easily. 
## LYSANDER exits.
## DEMETRIUS enters.
###DEMETRIUS
Lysander, say something! You coward, did you run away from me? Say something! Are you behind some bush? Where are you hiding? 
###ROBIN
(in LYSANDER’s voice) You coward, are you bragging to the stars and telling the bushes that you want a fight, but then you won’t come and fight me? Come here, you coward! Come here, you child! I’ll beat you with a stick. It would be shameful to fight you with a sword, the way I would fight with a real man. 
###DEMETRIUS
Are you there? 
###ROBIN
(in LYSANDER’s voice) Follow my voice. This isn’t a good place to fight. 
##They exit.
## LYSANDER enters.
###LYSANDER
He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him. When I reach the place he’s calling from, he disappears. This villain is much quicker than I am. I ran after him fast, but he ran away from me faster, so that now here I am in some dark part of the forest where the ground is uneven. 
I’ll rest here. (he lies down) I hope the pleasant daytime comes soon! As soon as the gray light of early morning appears, I’ll find Demetrius and get my revenge for this insult. 
## LYSANDER lies down and falls asleep. ROBIN and DEMETRIUS enter.
###ROBIN
(in LYSANDER’s voice) Ha, ha, ha! Hey, You coward, why aren’t you coming? 
###DEMETRIUS
Wait for me, if you’re not too scared! I know that’s why you’re running away from me, constantly changing places—you’re afraid to stand still and wait for me. You’re scared to look me in the eye. Where are you now? 
###ROBIN
(in LYSANDER’s voice) Come here. I’m over here. 
###DEMETRIUS
No, you’re just taunting me. You’ll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight. Go wherever you want. I’m exhausted; I need to lie down and sleep on this cold ground. But watch out. I’ll find you at dawn. (DEMETRIUS lies down and sleeps) 
## HELENA enters.
###HELENA
Oh, what a long, tedious, exhausting night! I wish it would end. I wish the comforting light of day would shine so I can go back to Athens and get away from these people who hate me so much. I hope I’ll be able to sleep and escape my troubles for a while. People can sometimes forget their difficulties when they’re asleep. (HELENA lies down and sleeps) 
###ROBIN
Only three so far? We’re still waiting for one more. Two of both kinds makes four. Ah, here she comes, angry and sad. Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this. 
## HERMIA enters.
###HERMIA
I’ve never been more exhausted or upset. I’m all wet from the dew and scratched up by thorns, and I can’t crawl any farther. I just can’t go on. My legs can’t hold themselves up. I’ll sleep here until morning. If they do fight, I hope Lysander is safe! (HERMIA lies down and sleeps) 
###ROBIN
Sleep well there on the ground. I’ll cure you, gentle lover, by putting this medicine on your eyes. (ROBIN puts the nectar of the flower on LYSANDER’s eyelids) When you wake you will be truly delighted to see the woman you once loved. And when you wake up, you’ll be a walking illustration of the well-known country proverb. “Jack will have Jill and everything will be all right.” 
## ROBIN exits.
## DEMETRIUS, HELENA, HERMIA, and LYSANDER are still sleeping on the stage. TITANIA enters with BOTTOM, who still has a donkey’s head, and the fairies PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED. OBERON enters behind them, unseen by those onstage.
###TITANIA
(to BOTTOM) Come over here and sit down on this flowery bed while I caress those lovable cheeks. I’ll put roses on your silky, smooth head and kiss your big, beautiful ears, my gentle darling. 
###BOTTOM
Where’s Peaseblossom? 
###PEASEBLOSSOM
Here. 
###BOTTOM
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s Monsieur Cobweb? 
###COBWEB
Here. 
###BOTTOM
Monsieur Cobweb, sir, get out your weapons and kill me a striped bumblebee on a thistle, and bring me its honey. Don’t tire yourself out, monsieur. Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac. I’d hate to see you drowned in honey, sir. 
## COBWEB exits.
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed? 
###MUSTARDSEED
Here. 
###BOTTOM
Give me your first, Mr. Mustardseed. Please, stop bowing, good sir. 
###MUSTARDSEED
What would you like me to do? 
###BOTTOM
Nothing, good sir, except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head. I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face. And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little, I need to scratch. 
###TITANIA
Would you like to hear some music, my sweet love? 
###BOTTOM
I have a pretty good ear for music. Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks. 
###TITANIA
Or tell me, my sweet love, what you’d like to eat. 
###BOTTOM
Actually, I’d like a few pounds of grass. I’d like to munch on some good dry oats. Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay. There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay. 
###TITANIA
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts. 
###BOTTOM
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But please don’t let any of your people wake me up. I really want to sleep now. 
###TITANIA
Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you. Fairies, go away. Run off in all directions. 
##The FAIRIES exit.
I’m putting my arms around you just like the woodbine tendril gently twists itself around the sweet honeysuckle, and like the female ivy curls itself around the branches of the elm tree. Oh, how I love you! I’m so crazy about you! 
## BOTTOM and TITANIA sleep. ROBIN enters.
##
###OBERON
Welcome, good Robin. Do you see this sweet sight? Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated. I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her. She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass. When I had taunted her as much as I wanted to, and she begged me very nicely to leave her alone, I asked her for the stolen Indian child. She said yes right away, and sent a fairy to bring him to my home in Fairyland. And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong. And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens. They’ll only remember the events of tonight as a very unpleasant dream. But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell. 
##(OBERON squeezes the juice from the second flower into TITANIA’s eyes)
Be like you used to be, and see like you used to see. This bud belongs to Diana, the goddess of virginity, and it has the power to undo the effects of Cupid’s flower. Now, Titania, wake up, my sweet queen. 
###TITANIA
(waking up) Oberon, I’ve had such a strange dream! I dreamed I was in love with an ass. 
###OBERON
There’s your boyfriend, sleeping right over there. 
###TITANIA
How did this happen? Oh, I hate looking at his face now! 
###OBERON
Be quiet for a while.—Robin, take off his donkey head.—Titania, get the fairies to play some music, and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before. 
###TITANIA
Music! Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep. 
##The music plays.
###ROBIN
(removing the ass’s head from BOTTOM) When you wake up, see things with your own foolish eyes again. 
###OBERON
Play the music.—Take my hands, my queen, and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing. (he dances with TITANIA) Now that you and I are friends again, we can dance for Duke Theseus tomorrow at midnight, and bless his marriage and his marriage bed. These other lovers will get married alongside him, and they’ll all be in high spirits. 
###ROBIN
Listen, Fairy King. I can hear the lark singing. Morning’s here. 
###OBERON
In that case, my queen, let’s travel silently and solemnly across the globe to where it’s still night, circling the earth faster than the moon does. 
###TITANIA
While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night. 
## OBERON, TITANIA, and ROBIN exit.
##A hunting horn blows. THESEUS enters with his servants, EGEUS and HIPPOLYTA.
###THESEUS
One of you go find the forest ranger. Since we’re done with the May Day rites and it’s still so early in the morning, my love will have a chance to hear the beautiful music of my hunting dogs barking as they chase their prey. Unleash the dogs in the western valley. Let them go. Now go find the forest ranger. 
##A servant exits.
My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music. 
###HIPPOLYTA
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear. I’d never heard such impressive barking before. 
The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds. I’d never heard such raucous music, such pleasant thunder. 
###THESEUS
My dogs are bred from Spartan hounds. They have the same folds of flesh around their mouths, the same sandy-colored fur, and hanging ears that brush the morning dew off the grass. They have crooked knees and folds of skin under their necks, just like the Spartan hounds. They’re not very fast in the chase, but their barking sounds like bells ringing. Each bark is perfectly in tune with the others, like notes on a scale. No one, anywhere, has ever gone hunting with a more musical pack of dogs. Judge for yourself when you hear them. (he sees the four lovers sleeping) But wait a minute! Who are these women? 
###EGEUS
My lord, that’s my daughter asleep on the ground over there, and this is Lysander here, and this is Demetrius, and this is Helena, old Nedar’s daughter. I don’t understand why they’re all here together. 
###THESEUS
They probably woke up early to celebrate May Day and came here for my celebration when they heard I’d be here. But tell me, Egeus. Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius? 
###EGEUS
It is, my lord. 
###THESEUS
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up. 
##A servant exits.
##Someone shouts offstage. Horns are blown. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA, wake up.
Good morning, my friends. Valentine’s Day is over. 
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now? 
## LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA all kneel.
###LYSANDER
Forgive us, my lord. 
###THESEUS
Please, all of you, stand up. 
## LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA get up.
(to LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS) I know you two are enemies. Has the world really become so gentle and peaceful that people who hate each other have started to trust each other and sleep beside each other without being afraid? 
###LYSANDER
My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake. I swear, at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here. But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia. We were planning to leave Athens to escape the Athenian law and— 
###EGEUS
(to THESEUS) Enough, enough, my lord. You’ve heard enough evidence! I insist that the law punish him—They were going to run away, Demetrius, they were running away to defeat us, robbing you of your wife and me of my fatherly right to decide who my son-in-law will be. 
###DEMETRIUS
(to THESEUS) My lord, the beautiful Helena told me about their secret plan to escape into this forest. I was furious and followed them here, and the lovely Helena was so in love with me that she followed me. 
I’m not sure how it happened—but somehow, something made my love for Hermia melt away like snow. My past love for Hermia now seems like a memory of some cheap toy I used to love as a child. Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena. I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia. Then I hated her for a time, as a sick person hates the food he usually loves. But now I have my natural taste back, like a sick person when he recovers. Now I want Helena, I love her, I long for her, and I will always be true to her. 
###THESEUS
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here. We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes. These couples will be married along with me and Hippolyta in the temple later today.—And now, since the morning is almost over, we’ll give up on the idea of hunting. Come with us to Athens. We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast. Come, Hippolyta. 
## THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, and EGEUS exit with their followers.
###DEMETRIUS
What exactly just happened? The events of last night seem small and hard to see clearly, like far-off mountains that look like clouds in the distance. 
###HERMIA
Yes, it’s like my eyes are out of focus, and I’m seeing everything double. 
###HELENA
Me too. 
I won Demetrius so easily, as if he were a precious diamond I just found lying around. It’s mine because I found it, but I feel like someone else could easily come and claim it was hers. 
###DEMETRIUS
Are you sure we’re awake? It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming. Do you remember seeing the duke here? Did he tell us to follow him? 
###HERMIA
Yes, he did. And my father was here too. 
###HELENA
And Hippolyta. 
###LYSANDER
And he told us to follow him to the temple. 
###DEMETRIUS
Well, then, we’re awake. Let’s follow him. We can tell one another our dreams along the way. 
## LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA exit.
###BOTTOM
(waking up) Tell me when my cue comes, and I’ll say my line. My next cue is “Most handsome Pyramus.” Hey! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-repairman? Snout the handyman? Starveling? My God, they’ve all run away and left me sleeping here? What a weird dream I had.—You can’t even describe such a weird dream. You’d be an ass if you even tried to explain it. I thought I was—no, nobody can even describe what I was. I thought I was, I thought I had—but a person would be an idiot to try to say what I thought I had. No eye has ever heard, no ear has ever seen, no hand has tasted, or tongue felt, or heart described what my dream was like. I’ll get Peter Quince to write this dream down as a ballad. 
I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom. And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play. Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies. 
## BOTTOM exits.
## QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING enter.
###QUINCE
Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house? Has he come home yet? 
###STARVELING
No one’s heard from him. I’m sure he’s been kidnapped. 
###FLUTE
If he doesn’t show up, the play is ruined. It won’t go on. Will it? 
###QUINCE
No, it would be impossible. He’s the only person in Athens who can play Pyramus. 
###FLUTE
Definitely. He’s quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens. 
###QUINCE
Yes, and the best looking too. And his voice is the paramour of sweetness. 
###FLUTE
You mean “paragon.” A “paramour” is something bad. 
## SNUG enters.
###SNUG
The duke’s leaving the temple. Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too. If we’d been able to put on our play, we would have had it made. 
###FLUTE
Oh that great, funny guy, Bottom! He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life. Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him. I’ll be damned if the duke wouldn’t have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus. 
And he would have deserved it too. Pyramus is worth six pence a day, or it’s worth nothing! 
## BOTTOM enters.
###BOTTOM
Where are my guys? Where are my good fellows? 
###QUINCE
Bottom! Oh, how wonderful to see you! Oh, what a relief! 
###BOTTOM
My friends, I’ve got some amazing things to tell you—but don’t ask me to tell you what. I swear by my Athenian citizenship that I won’t tell you anything. I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened. 
###QUINCE
Tell us, Bottom. 
###BOTTOM
No, you won’t get a word out of me. All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already. Now it’s time to get your costumes together. Find some good strings for tying on your false beards, and grab new ribbons to decorate your shoes. Meet me at the palace as soon as possible. Look over your lines again. Our play’s going to be performed for the duke! So make sure Thisbe’s wearing clean underwear, and make sure whoever’s playing the lion doesn’t cut his nails, because he needs them long to look like lion’s claws. And no one eat any onions or garlic. If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking. Get busy, go! 
##They all exit.
## THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, and PHILOSTRATE enter, with a number of lords and servants.
###HIPPOLYTA
These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus. 
###THESEUS
Yes, strange—and totally made up too. I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales. Lovers and madmen hallucinate about things that sane people just can’t understand. Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations. some people think they see devils and monsters everywhere—and they’re lunatics. Lovers are just as crazy, and think a dark-skinned gypsy is the most gorgeous woman in the world. Poets are always looking around like they’re having a fit, confusing the mundane with the otherworldly, and describing things in their writing that simply don’t exist. All these people have such strong imaginations that, when they feel happy, they assume a god or some other supernatural being is bringing that happiness to them. Or if they’re afraid of something at night, they look at the shrubbery and imagine it’s a wild bear! 
###HIPPOLYTA
But the story that these lovers are telling, and the fact that they all saw and heard exactly the same things, make me think there’s more going on here than imaginary fantasies. Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent. 
##The lovers—LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA—enter.
###THESEUS
Here come the lovers, laughing happily.—I wish you joy, my friends! I hope the days ahead are full of joy for you. 
###LYSANDER
We wish you even more joy, and hope joy comes to you in your royal walks, at your table, and in your royal bed! 
###THESEUS
Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime? Where is our entertainment director? What performances have been prepared? Aren’t there any plays for us to enjoy while we wait in torture for bedtime to come? Let me see Philostrate. 
###PHILOSTRATE
Here I am, Theseus. 
###THESEUS
Tell us what entertainment you’ve prepared for the evening. Which plays, what music? How will we pass the time without some entertainment? 
###PHILOSTRATE
(giving THESEUS a piece of paper) Here’s a list of all of the acts that have been prepared. Choose which one you want to see first. 
###THESEUS
(reading) “The battle between Hercules and the Centaurs, to be sung by an Athenian eunuch, accompanied by a harp.” No, we won’t see that. I’ve already told that story to Hippolyta, while praising my cousin Hercules. What else? “The riot of the drunk Bacchanals who rip the singer Orpheus to shreds.” That’s an old show, and I saw it the last time I came back from conquering 
Thebes. “The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding. “A tedious short drama about young Pyramus and his love Thisbe, a very sad and tragic comedy.” A sad comedy? Short but still tedious? That’s like hot ice and strange snow. How can this drama be so many contradictory things? 
###PHILOSTRATE
It’s a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of. But in my opinion, it’s about ten words too long. That’s why it’s tedious. In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part. It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself. I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal, I had tears in my eyes—but they were tears of laughter. 
###THESEUS
Who are the actors? 
###PHILOSTRATE
Rough workmen from Athens who never spent much time thinking. Now they’ve worn out their out-of-shape brains to put on this play for your wedding. 
###THESEUS
So let’s see it. 
###PHILOSTRATE
No, my noble lord. This play isn’t right for you. I’ve seen the whole thing, and it’s completely worthless—unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines—which they memorized so painfully—are funny. 
###THESEUS
I’ll watch this play. Nothing can really be bad when it’s created by simple people who try hard. Come on, bring them in. And sit down, ladies. 
## PHILOSTRATE exits.
###HIPPOLYTA
I don’t like seeing poor people overburdened or looking bad when they’re trying to do something good. 
###THESEUS
You won’t see anything like that, sweetheart. 
###HIPPOLYTA
He just said that they’re no good at acting. 
###THESEUS
Then we’re even kinder people for thanking them for something that they’re not good at. We’ll entertain ourselves by accepting their mistakes. When poor dutiful people can’t do certain things well, generous people can consider the effort they put into it rather than the effect that they produce. In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me. Trust me, my sweet, I figured out that they were trying to welcome me even though they were silent, and that message was as clear from someone who was modest and nervously dutiful as it is from someone who is loud and audacious and eloquent. Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion. 
## PHILOSTRATE enters.
###PHILOSTRATE
Your grace, the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready. 
###THESEUS
Let him come forward. 
##The PROLOGUE (QUINCE) enters.
###PROLOGUE
If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to. We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions. Our plan to show off our little bit of talent will wind up getting us executed. Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite. We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy. We’re absolutely not here to delight you. The actors are ready to come out and make you sorry. By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know. 
###THESEUS
This guy doesn’t pay much attention to punctuation. 
###LYSANDER
He rode that prologue like a wild horse. He didn’t know how to stop it. The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically. 
###HIPPOLYTA
Yes, he performed his prologue like a child plays a recorder—he can make sounds, but they’re out of control. 
###THESEUS
His speech was like a tangled chain. It went on and on and was a total mess. Who’s next? 
## BOTTOM enters as PYRAMUS, with FLUTE as THISBE, SNOUT as WALL, STARVELING as MOONSHINE, and SNUG as LION.
###PROLOGUE
(delivered by QUINCE) Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you are wondering what is going on. Well, keep wondering, until the truth makes everything clear. This man is Pyramus, if you want to know. This beautiful lady is definitely Thisbe. This man with the limestone and cement is portraying Wall, that horrible wall that kept these lovers apart. They are content to whisper through Wall’s little hole, the poor souls, and no one should be surprised. This man, with his lantern, dog, and thornbush, portrays Moonshine, because, if you want to know, the lovers were not ashamed to meet each other by moonshine at Ninus’s tomb in order to carry on their courtship. This grisly beast, which is called “Lion,” scared away, or rather frightened, the faithful Thisbe when she arrived at the meeting place at night. As she ran away from him, she dropped her cloak, which the horrible Lion stained with his bloody mouth. Soon Pyramus comes along, a tall and handsome young man, and finds his faithful Thisbe’s cloak to be dead. At this point, he takes his sword, his bloody blameful blade, and bravely breaks open his boiling bloody breast. And Thisbe, hiding in the shade of the mulberry bushes, took his dagger and killed herself. For the rest of the story, let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and the two lovers talk more about it, since they’re standing here. 
###THESEUS
I wonder if the lion’s going to talk. 
###DEMETRIUS
It wouldn’t surprise me, my lord. If these asses can speak, a lion should be able to. 
## PROLOGUE, THISBE, LION, and MOONSHINE exit.
###WALL
(played by SNOUT) At this point I, Snout, play a wall. But not just any wall. I want you to understand that I’m pretending to be a kind of wall that has a little hole in it. The lovers Pyramus and Thisbe often whispered very secretly through that hole. This clay, this cement, and this stone that I’m carrying around show that I’m that wall. It’s the truth. And this is the crack, right side and left side (points with two fingers), through which the frightened lovers will be whispering. 
###THESEUS
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better? 
###DEMETRIUS
It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak, my lord. 
## PYRAMUS enters.
###THESEUS
Pyramus is coming up to the wall. Be quiet! 
###PYRAMUS
(played by BOTTOM) Oh, grim-looking night! Oh, night that is so black in color! Oh night, which is always there when it is not day! Oh night! Oh night! So sad, sad, sad, 
I’m afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise!—And you, oh Wall, oh sweet, oh lovely Wall, you stand between her father’s property and mine, you Wall, oh Wall, oh sweet and lovely Wall. Show me your hole to stick my eye up against! 
## WALL holds up two fingers
Thank you, you’re such a polite wall. God bless you for doing this. But what’s this I see? I don’t see any Thisbe. Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness! Damn your stones for disappointing me like this! 
###THESEUS
Since the wall is conscious, it should curse back at him. 
###BOTTOM
(out of character) No, actually, sir, he shouldn’t say anything. It’s not his turn, it’s Thisbe’s. “Disappointing me like this” is Thisbe’s cue. She’s supposed to enter now, and I’ll see her through the wall. You’ll see, it’ll happen exactly like I say. Here she comes. 
## THISBE enters.
###THISBE
(played by FLUTE) Oh wall, you’ve often heard me moaning because you keep me separated from my handsome Pyramus! My cherry lips have often kissed your bricks, which are stuck together with cement. 
###PYRAMUS
I see a voice! I’ll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face. Thisbe? 
###THISBE
You are my love, my love, I think. 
###PYRAMUS
I’m your love, no matter what you think. And I’m still faithful to you, just like the famous Limander. 
###THISBE
And I’ll be as faithful to you as Helen of Troy, until the day I die. 
###PYRAMUS
Not even Shafalus was as faithful to his lover Procrus as I am to you. 
###THISBE
Me too, I’m as faithful as Shafalus to Procrus. 
###PYRAMUS
Oh, kiss me through the hole in this nasty wall. 
###THISBE
But I’m only kissing the wall’s hole, not your lips at all. 
###PYRAMUS
Will you meet me right away at Ninny’s grave? 
###THISBE
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming. 
## PYRAMUS and THISBE exit.
###WALL
I, Wall, have done my part. Now that I’m done, Wall can go away. 
## WALL exits.
###THESEUS
The lovers should’ve waited around a little longer—the wall between them is down now. 
###DEMETRIUS
What can you do? That’s what happens with talking walls. 
###HIPPOLYTA
This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen. 
###THESEUS
The best plays are still only illusions, and the worst are just as good, if you just use your imagination to fill them in. 
###HIPPOLYTA
In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting, not the play. 
###THESEUS
If we imagine these guys as they imagine themselves, then they’re first-class actors. Look, here come two noble animals, a man and a lion. 
## LION and MOONSHINE enter.
###LION
(played by SNUG) You, ladies, whose gentle hearts make you afraid of the smallest monstrous mouse that crawls around on the floor, might quake and tremble now when the wild lion roars in his most violent rage. You should know that I, Snug the carpenter, am not a fierce lion or a lioness, because if I were a lion and I showed up here to cause trouble, I’d be taking my life in my hands. 
###THESEUS
Ah, it’s a sensitive animal, with a good conscience. 
###DEMETRIUS
He’s the best actor I’ve ever seen play a lion. 
###LYSANDER
He’s as brave as a fox. 
###THESEUS
True. And as wise as a goose. 
###DEMETRIUS
Oh, that’s not true, my lord. He’s not brave enough to be wise. 
###THESEUS
He’s not wise enough to be brave. Anyway, he is what he is. Let’s listen to the moon. 
###MOONSHINE
This lantern represents the horned moon— 
###DEMETRIUS
He should have worn the horns on his head. 
###THESEUS
He’s not a crescent moon, so his horns must be invisible inside the circle. 
###MOONSHINE
This lantern represents the moon. I myself am playing the man in the moon— 
###THESEUS
Well then, that’s the biggest mistake of all. The man should be inside the lantern. How else is he the “man in the moon”? 
###DEMETRIUS
He can’t go in there because of the candle. It’s too hot. 
###HIPPOLYTA
I’m tired of this moon. I wish he’d wax or wane off the stage. 
###THESEUS
It seems like he’s waning, but out of politeness we’ll have to wait and see. 
###LYSANDER
Go ahead, Moon. 
###MOONSHINE
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon, I’m the man in the moon, this thornbush is my thornbush, and this dog is my dog. 
###DEMETRIUS
Well, all of these should be in the lantern, because they’re all in the moon. But be quiet, here comes Thisbe. 
## THISBE enters.
###THISBE
This is old Ninny’s tomb. But where is my love? 
###LION
(roaring) Hey! 
## THISBE runs off, dropping her cloak.
###DEMETRIUS
Good roaring, Lion! 
###THESEUS
Good running, Thisbe! 
###HIPPOLYTA
Good shining, Moon!—Really, the Moon shines very well. 
## LION shakes THISBE’s cloak around and stains it with blood.
###THESEUS
That’s good, Lion! Shake it around like a cat with a mouse. 
## PYRAMUS enters.
###DEMETRIUS
And then Pyramus showed up. 
## LION exits.
###LYSANDER
So the lion disappeared. 
###PYRAMUS
Sweet Moon, I thank you for your sunny beams. I thank you, Moon, for shining now so bright, because by the light of your gracious, golden, glittering gleams, I hope to be able to see my faithful Thisbe.—But wait. Oh no! But, look, poor me, what a terrible tragedy is here! Eyes, do you see? How can it be? Oh, dainty duck! Oh, dear! Your cloak so good, what, stained with blood? Come, terrible Furies, and punish whoever has hurt her! Oh, Fate, come and cut the thread of my life. Conquer, crush, conclude, and kill! 
###THESEUS
You could get sad watching this actor’s passionate lament—if one of your good friends happened to die right at the same time. 
###HIPPOLYTA
Damned if I don’t feel sorry for him. 
###PYRAMUS
Oh, Mother Nature, why did you create lions? A mean and awful lion has deflowered my darling, who is—no, no, who was the most beautiful lady who ever lived, or loved, or liked, or looked. Come on, tears, pour over me! Come on out, sword, and wound Pyramus in the chest—yes, right here on the left side where his heart is. (PYRAMUS stabs himself) 
And so I’m dying. Here I go, here I go. Okay, now I’m dead. My soul has fled to the sky. My tongue shall see no more, It’s time for the moon to go away. 
## MOONSHINE exits.
Now die, die, die, die, die. (PYRAMUS dies) 
###DEMETRIUS
Is someone throwing dice? I guess it’s “die,” not dice, since there’s only one of him. 
###LYSANDER
Actually he’s a die with no dots, since he’s nothing—he’s dead. 
###THESEUS
With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again. 
###HIPPOLYTA
If Moonshine’s gone before Thisbe comes back, how will she be able to see in the dark to find her lover dead? 
###THESEUS
She’ll see him by starlight. Here she comes. Her moaning and groaning will end the play. 
## THISBE enters.
###HIPPOLYTA
I don’t think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning. I hope she keeps it short. 
###DEMETRIUS
I can’t decide whether Pyramus or Thisbe is better. God help us if he’s a better man. But God help us if she’s a better woman. 
###LYSANDER
Look, she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers. 
###DEMETRIUS
And now she’ll start moaning, of course— 
###THISBE
Are you asleep, my love? What, are you dead, my dove? Oh, Pyramus, get up! Speak, speak. Can’t you talk? Dead, dead? The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes! Your lily-white lips, your cherry-red nose, and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone, gone forever. Lovers, moan and weep. His eyes were as green as leeks. Oh, Fate, come, come to me, with hands as pale as milk. Soak your hands in blood and gore, since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors. Tongue, do not speak. Come, trusty sword. Come, blade, drench my breast with blood. (she stabs herself) Goodbye, friends! This is how Thisbe comes to an end. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. (THISBE dies) 
###THESEUS
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead. 
###DEMETRIUS
Yes, and Wall too. 
###BOTTOM
(out of character) No, I assure you. The wall that kept their fathers apart has been taken down. Would you like to see the epilogue or hear a country dance between two of us? 
###THESEUS
No epilogue, please. Your play doesn’t need to be excused afterward with an epilogue. Never apologize—when the actors are all dead, no one can be blamed. As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt, it would have been a very good tragedy. It’s a good tragedy, very well done. But come on, let’s see you do your dance. Forget your epilogue. 
##The actors dance, and BOTTOM and FLUTE exit.
The clock has chimed midnight. Lovers, it’s time to go to bed. It’s almost fairy time. I’m afraid we’re going to oversleep in the morning as late as we’ve stayed up tonight.This blatantly stupid play helped us kill the time until bed. Dear friends, let’s go to bed. We’ll continue this celebration for two weeks, with nightly parties and new fun. 
##They all exit.
## ROBIN enters.
###ROBIN
Now the hungry lion roars and the wolf howls at the moon. The farmer snores, exhausted from his work. The charred logs glow in the fireplace, and the owl’s hoot makes the sick man think about his own death. Now is the time of night when graves open wide and release spirits to glide over the graveyard paths. 
And we fairies, who run away from the sun just like the goddess of the night, following darkness like a dream, are getting antsy. But I’m here to make sure that not even a mouse disturbs this blessed house. I’ve been sent to clean house a bit before the fairies come. 
## OBERON and TITANIA enter with their servants and followers.
###OBERON
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house. I want every elf and fairy to hop lightly, like a bird on a twig, and to sing and dance this song along with me. 
###TITANIA
First rehearse your song from memory, and make sure each note is pretty. We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace. 
## OBERON and TITANIA lead the FAIRIES in song and dance.
###OBERON
(singing) Now, until morning, each fairy should walk through this house. Titania and I will go to the royal marriage bed to bless it, and the children conceived in that bed will always have good luck. Each of the three couples will always be faithful and in love, and their children will have no deformities. 
They won’t have moles, or harelips, or scars, or abnormal markings, or anything else that might alarm someone if their baby was born with it. Use this blessed dew from the fields to bless each room in the palace with sweet peace. And the blessed owner will always be safe. Run along. Don’t stay long. Meet me at dawn. 
##They all exit except for ROBIN.
###ROBIN
If we actors have offended you, just think of it this way and everything will be all right—you were asleep when you saw these visions, and this silly and pathetic story was no more real than a dream. Ladies and gentlemen, don’t get upset with me. If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right. I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon. If not, then I’m a liar. So good night to everyone. Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you. 
##He exits.
